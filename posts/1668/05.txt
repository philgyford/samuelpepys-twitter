1668-05-31 22:26 r At the play at Court the other night, Mrs. Davis was there; and when she was to come to dance her jigg, the Queene would not stay to see it, which people do think it was out of displeasure at her being the King’s whore, that she could not bear it.

1668-05-31 22:22   I hear that Mrs. Davis is quite gone from the Duke of York’s house, and Gosnell comes in her room, which I am glad of.

1668-05-31 22:00 r So back, and at Somerset-stairs do understand that a boy is newly drowned, washing himself there, and they cannot find his body.

1668-05-31 20:14 r Here was Mrs. Manuel also, and mighty good company, and good mirth in making W. Howe spend his six or seven shillings, and so they called him altogether “Cully”.

1668-05-31 19:30   I by water to the New Exchange, and there to Mrs. Pierces, where Knepp, and she, and W. Howe, and Mr. Pierce, and little Betty, over to Fox Hall, and there walked and supped with great pleasure.

1668-05-30 22:10 r But, Lord! what loose cursed company was this, that I was in tonight, though full of wit; and worth a man’s being in for once, to know the nature of it, and their manner of talk, and lives.

1668-05-30 21:03 r Harris telling how it was by a meeting of some young blades, where he was among them, and my Lady Bennet and her ladies; and their there dancing naked, and all the roguish things in the world.

1668-05-30 20:58 r And so to supper in an arbour: but, Lord! their mad bawdy talk did make my heart ake! And here I first understood by their talk the meaning of the company that lately were called Ballet.

1668-05-30 19:48 r There fell into the company of Harry Killigrew, a rogue newly come back out of France, but still in disgrace at our Court, and young Newport and others, as very rogues as any in the town, who were ready to take hold of every woman that come by them.

1668-05-30 19:40   To the New Exchange, and there met Harris and Rolt, and one Richards, a tailor and great company-keeper, and with these over to Fox Hall.

1668-05-30 18:27 r Here I was freed from a fear that Knepp was angry or might take advantage; did parlar the esto that yo did the otr day quand yo was con her in ponendo her mano upon mi cosa — but I saw no such thing; but as pleased as ever, and I believe she can bear with any such thing.

1668-05-30 18:15   To Mr. Pierces, and there saw Knepp also, and were merry; and here saw my little Lady Katherine Montagu come to town, about her eyes, which are sore, and they think the King’s evil, poor, pretty lady.

1668-05-30 17:03   To the King’s playhouse, and saw “Philaster”. It is pretty to see how I could remember all along, ever since I was a boy, Arethusa the part which I was to have acted at Sir Robert Cooke’s; to think what a ridiculous thing it would have been for me to have acted a beautiful woman.

1668-05-30 08:20   Up, and put on a new summer black bombazin suit, and so to the office; and being come now to an agreement with my barber, to keep my perriwig in good order at 20s. a-year, I am like to go very spruce, more than I used to do.

1668-05-29 23:13 r This night yo had agreed para andar at Deptford, there para haber lain con the moher de Bagwell, but this company did hinder me.

1668-05-29 23:03 r Both sing, but the latter with great skill — the other, no skill, but a good voice, and a good basse, but used to sing only tavern tunes; and so I spent all this evening till eleven at night singing with them, till I was tired of them.

1668-05-29 18:04   Home, whither, by agreement, by and by comes Mercer and Gayet, and two gentlemen with them, Mr. Monteith and Pelham, the former a swaggering young handsome gentleman, the latter a sober citizen merchant.

1668-05-29 14:18   I did receive another letter from my Lord Sandwich, which troubles me to see how I have neglected him, in not writing, or but once, all this time of his being abroad; and I see he takes notice, but yet gently, of it, that it puts me to great trouble.

1668-05-29 09:52 r But Sir W. Coventry did declare that, in wisdom, it was better to do so; but that, in obedience to the Parliament, he was setting out the 50 sail talked on, though it spent all the money, and to little purpose.

1668-05-29 09:38   It is pretty to see how Prince Rupert and other mad, silly people, are for setting out but a little fleet, there being no occasion for it; and say it will be best to save the money for better uses.

1668-05-28 21:10 r To Fox Hall, where with great pleasure we walked, and then to the upper end of the further retired walk, and there sat and sang, and brought great many gallants and fine people about us, and, upon the bench, we did by and by eat and drink what we had, and very merry.

1668-05-28 19:14   By coach to the New Exchange, and there by agreement at my bookseller’s shop met Mercer and Gayet, and took them by water, first to one of the Neat-houses, where walked in the garden, but nothing but a bottle of wine to be had, though pleased with seeing the garden.

1668-05-28 14:32   To the office, being pleased that this morning my bookseller brings me home Marcennus’s book of musick, which costs me 3l. 2s.; but is a very fine book.

1668-05-27 22:34 r Particularly about Noah’s arke, where he do give a very good account thereof, showing how few the number of the several species of beasts and fowls were that were to be in the arke, and that there was room enough for them and their food and dung, which do please me mightily.

1668-05-27 22:32   Home, and there vexed at my boy’s being out of doors till ten at night, but it was upon my brother Jackson’s business, and so I was the less displeased, and then made the boy to read to me out of Dr. Wilkins his “Real Character".

1668-05-27 16:50   And so to see Sir W. Pen, who I find still very ill of the goute, sitting in his great chair, made on purpose for persons sick of that disease, for their ease; and this very chair, he tells me, was made for my Lady Lambert!

1668-05-27 15:21 r After dinner he did take me out, and walked together, who told me that he had now newly entered himself into Orders, in the decay of the Church, and did think it his duty so to do, thereby to do his part toward the support and reformation thereof.

1668-05-27 14:52   With Sir D. Gawden to his house, with my Lord Brouncker and Sir J. Minnes, to dinner, where we dined very well, and much good company, among others, a Dr., a fat man, whom by face I know, as one that uses to sit in our church.

1668-05-27 10:40   Meeting with Mr. Sawyers my old chamber-fellow, he and I by water together to the Temple, he giving me an account of the base, rude usage, which he and Sir G. Carteret had lately, before the Commissioners of Accounts, which I was sorry to hear.

1668-05-26 22:04   To bed, being a little vexed at what W. Hewer tells me Sir John Shaw did this day in my absence say at the Board, complaining of my doing of him injury and the board permitting it.

1668-05-26 20:20 r So home, where we find all well, and brother Balty and his wife looking to the house, she mighty fine, in a new gold-laced ‘just a cour’.

1668-05-26 19:50 r We got to Bishopsgate Street before eight o’clock, the waters being now most of them down, and we avoiding the bad way in the forest by a privy way, which brought us to Hodsden; and so to Tibalds, that road, which was mighty pleasant.

1668-05-26 13:34 r The boy and I to sing, and so about noon come to Bishop’s Stafford, to another house than what we were at the other day, and better used. And here I paid for the reckoning 11s., we dining together, and pretty merry.

1668-05-26 06:05   We were called to the coach, where about six o’clock we set out, there being a man and two women of one company, ordinary people, and one lady alone, that is tolerably handsome, but mighty well spoken, whom I took great pleasure in talking to.

1668-05-25 21:04 r Walked to Chesterton, to see our old walk, and there into the Church, the bells ringing, and saw the place I used to sit in, and so to the ferry, and ferried over to the other side, and walked with great pleasure, the river being mighty high by Barnewell Abbey.

1668-05-25 20:15 r I hear by the butler’s man, who was son to Goody Mulliner over against the College, that we used to buy stewed prunes of, concerning the College and persons in it; and find very few, only Mr. Hollins and Pechell, I think, that were of my time.

1668-05-25 19:55 r I took my boy and two brothers, and walked to Magdalene College: and there into the butterys, as a stranger, and there drank my bellyfull of their beer, which pleased me, as the best I ever drank.

1668-05-25 19:14 r I made them drink at the Chequers, where I observed the same tapster, Tom, that was there when I was a little boy and so we, at the end of the town, took leave of Shepley and the other gentleman, and so we away and got well to Cambridge.

1668-05-25 15:10 r I promising to fetch my wife away about fourteen days hence, we men on horseback, I took leave, there going with me and my boy, my two brothers, and one Browne for our guide, and also Mr. Shepley, to the end of Huntingdon, and another gentleman who come thither, one Mr. Castle.

1668-05-25 08:04 r To walk with my father in the garden, consulting what to do with him and this house when Pall and her husband go away; and I think it will be to let it and he go live with her, though I am against letting the house for any long time, because of having it to retire to, ourselves.

1668-05-25 06:40   Waked betimes, and lay long hazendo doz vezes con mi moher con grando pleasure to me and ella, and there fell to talking, and by and by rose.

1668-05-24 15:40 r My Lady Sandwich sending to see whether I was come, I took horse, and find her and her family at chapel; and thither I went in to them, and sat out the sermon, where I heard Jervas Fullwood preach a very good and seraphic kind of sermon, too good for an ordinary congregation.

1668-05-24 13:32 r Comes Mr. Phillips and dines with us, and a pretty odd-humoured man he seems to be; but good withal, but of mighty great methods in his eating and drinking, and will not kiss a woman since his wife’s death.

1668-05-24 09:27 r I saw my brothers and sister Jackson, she growing fat, and, since being married, I think looks comelier than before: but a mighty pert woman she is, and I think proud, he keeping her mighty handsome.

1668-05-24 07:33 r My wife and they got ready too, while I to my father, poor man, and walked with him up and down the house — it raining a little, and the waters all over Portholme and the meadows, so as no pleasure abroad.

1668-05-24 06:55 r And upgot the rest, Betty Turner and Willet and Jane, all whom I was glad to see, and very merry, and got me ready in my new stuff clothes that I send down before me.

1668-05-24 06:24 r I weary up to my wife’s chamber, whom I find in bed, and pretended a little not well, and indeed she hath those upon her, but fell to talk and mightily pleased both of us.

1668-05-24 06:10 r And so through the water with very good success, though very deep almost all the way, and got to Brampton, where most of them in bed.

1668-05-24 03:02   I up, at between two and three in the morning, and, calling up my boy, and father’s boy, we set out by three o’clock, it being high day.

1668-05-23 22:50 r After supper to bed; and there lay very ill, by reason of some drunken scholars making a noise all night, and vexed for fear that the horses should not be taken up from grass, time enough for the morning.

1668-05-23 21:47 r Well pleased all this journey with the conversation of him that went with me, who I think is a lawyer, and lives about Lynne, but his name I did not ask.

1668-05-23 21:10 r We come to Cambridge, after much bad way; and there, at the Rose, I met my father’s horses, with a man, staying for me. But it is so late, and the waters so deep, that I durst not go tonight.

1668-05-23 14:15 r I hear Mrs. Aynsworth is going to live at London: but I believe will be mistaken in it; for it will be found better for her to be chief where she is, than to have little to do at London.

1668-05-23 14:04 r The gentleman and I to dinner, and in comes Captain Forster, an acquaintance of his, he that do belong to my Lord Anglesey, who had been at the late horse-races at Newmarket, where the King now is, and says that they had fair weather there yesterday.

1668-05-23 12:58 r Away to Bishop’s Stafford, and there dined, and changed horses and coach, at Mrs. Aynsworth’s; but I took no knowledge of her.

1668-05-23 06:10 r Took coach, Tom and I, and a gentleman and his man, there being another coach also, with as many more, I think, in it.

1668-05-23 04:50   Up by four o’clock; and, getting my things ready, and recommending the care of my house to W. Hewer, I with my boy Tom, whom I take with me, to the Bull, in Bishopsgate Street.

1668-05-22 20:10 r But the less it troubles me because the King and Duke of York and Court are at this day at Newmarket, at a great horse-race, and proposed great pleasure for two or three days, but are in the same wet.

1668-05-22 20:04   Home, and fitted myself for my journey tomorrow, which I fear will not be pleasant, because of the wet weather, it raining very hard all this day.

1668-05-22 18:12   To my tailor’s and a mercer’s for patterns to carry my wife of cloth and silk for a bed, which I think will please her and me.

1668-05-22 17:10   To the Duke of York’s house to a play, and saw Sir Martin Marr-all, where the house is full; and though I have seen it, I think, ten times, yet the pleasure I have is yet as great as ever, and is undoubtedly the best comedy ever was wrote.

1668-05-22 14:40   After dinner comes Mr. Martin, the purser, and brings me his wife’s starling, which was formerly the King’s bird, that do speak and whistle finely, which I am mighty proud of and shall take pleasure in it.

1668-05-21 20:20   I took Mrs. Turner and Mercer out to Mile End and drank, and then home, and sang; and eat a dish of greene pease, the first I have seen this year, given me by Mr. Gibson, extraordinary young and pretty.

1668-05-21 14:12   To walk a little in the Hall, and so to Mrs. Martin’s, and there did hazer ce que yo voudrais mit her, and drank and sat most of the afternoon with her and her sister. She promises me her fine starling, which was the King’s, and speaks finely, which I shall be glad of.

1668-05-21 12:38 r Mr. Hater and Gibson did meet with many people talking of it, and many people of the towns about the city did see it, and the world do make much discourse of it, their apprehensions being mighty full of the rest of the City to be burned, and the Papists to cut our throats.

1668-05-21 12:34 r And I did see a sudden fire or light running in the sky, as it were towards Cheapside ward, and it vanished very quick, which did make me bethink myself what holyday it was, and took it for some rocket, though it was much brighter than any rocket, and so thought no more of it.

1668-05-21 12:30   All the town is full of the talk of a meteor, or some fire, that did on Saturday last fly over the City at night, which do put me in mind that, being then walking in the dark an hour or more myself I did see a light before me come from behind me, which made me turn back my head.

1668-05-21 10:00   Sir Richard Ford, who among other things congratulates me, as one or two did yesterday, my great purchase; and he advises me rather to forbear, if it be not done, as a thing that the world will envy me in: and what is it but my cozen Tom Pepys’s buying of Martin Abbey, in Surry!

1668-05-20 21:40 r To Charing Cross, and there took coach and away home, in my way going into Bishopsgate Street, to bespeak places for myself and boy to go to Cambridge in the coach this week, and so to Brampton, to see my wife.

1668-05-20 20:24 r Creed and I walked over the Park to the Mulberry-Garden, where I never was before; and find it a very silly place, worse than Spring-garden, and but little company, and those a rascally, whoring, roguing sort of people, only a wilderness here, that is somewhat pretty, but rude.

1668-05-20 19:37 r So Creed and I down to the New Exchange, and there cheapened ribbands for my wife, and so down to the Whey house and drank some and eat some curds, which did by and by make my belly ake mightily.

1668-05-20 18:22   I met with Creed; and took him to Hales’s, and there saw the beginnings of Harris’s head which he draws for me, which I do not yet like.

1668-05-20 17:20   To the King’s playhouse, and saw “The Mulberry Garden” again, and cannot be reconciled to it, but only to find here and there an independent sentence of wit, and that is all.

1668-05-20 09:30 r One was about this building of a ship with Hemskirke’s secret, to sail a third faster than any other ship; but he hath got Prince Rupert on his side, and by that means, I believe, will get his conditions made better than he would otherwise, or ought indeed.

1668-05-20 09:25 r To the Council-chamber, where the Committee of the Navy sat; and here we discoursed several things; but, Lord! like fools; so as it was a shame to see things of this importance managed by a Council that understand nothing of them.

1668-05-20 09:00   With Colonell Middleton, in a new coach he hath made him, very handsome, to White Hall, where the Duke of York having removed his lodgings for this year to St. James’s, we walked thither.

1668-05-19 22:22   To the office, where ended my letters, and then home, and there got Balty to read to me out of Sorbiere’s Observations in his Voyage into England, and then to bed.

1668-05-19 09:45 r Upon Sunday was se’nnight, at night, after the King had ordered his coach to be ready to carry him to the Park, he did take a pair of oars and all alone, or but one with him, go to Somersett House, and there clamber over the walls to make a visit to her, which is a horrid shame.

1668-05-19 09:42   Mr. Pierce tells me that since my Lord of Ormond’s coming over, the King begins to be mightily reclaimed, and sups every night with great pleasure with the Queene: and yet, it seems, he is mighty hot upon the Duchess of Richmond.

1668-05-18 20:10 r I find Mrs. Horsfield one of the veriest citizen’s wives in the world, so full of little silly talk, and now and then a little sillily bawdy, that I believe if you had her sola a man might hazer all with her.

1668-05-18 18:35 r I was vexed, in going in, to see a son of Sir H. Finch’s beating of a poor little dog to death, letting it lie in so much pain that made me mad to see it, till the servants of the house chiding of their young master, one of them come with a thong, and killed the dog outright.

1668-05-18 18:32 r So away thence, very little satisfied with the play, but pleased with my company. I carried them to Kensington, to the Grotto, and there we sang, to my great content.

1668-05-18 17:30 r And which made it the worse was, that there never was worse music played — that is, worse things composed, which made me and Captain Rolt, who happened to sit near me, mad.

1668-05-18 17:25 r But the play, though there was, here and there, a pretty saying, yet the whole of the play had nothing extraordinary in it; insomuch that the King I did not see laugh, nor pleased the whole play; insomuch that I have not been less pleased at a new play in my life, I think.

1668-05-18 14:55 r And so to the play again, where the King and Queen, by and by, come, and all the Court; and the house infinitely full.

1668-05-18 14:40 r I having sat here awhile, and eat nothing today, did slip out, getting a boy to keep my place; and to the Rose Tavern, and there got half a breast of mutton, off of the spit, and dined all alone.

1668-05-18 13:50   To the King’s playhouse, where the doors were not then open; but presently they did open; and we in, and find many people already come in, by private ways, into the pit, it being the first day of Sir Charles Sidly’s new play, so long expected, “The Mullberry Guarden”.

1668-05-18 09:15   To my Lord Bellasses, at his new house by my late Lord Treasurer’s, and there met him and Mr. Sherwin, Auditor Beale, and Creed, about my Lord’s accounts, and here my Lord showed me his new house, which, indeed, is mighty noble, and good pictures — indeed, not one bad one in it.

1668-05-17 20:45 r To Mile End, and there eat and drank, and so home; and I supped with them — that is, eat some butter and radishes, which is my excuse for not eating any other of their victuals, which I hate, because of their sluttery.

1668-05-17 19:39   I to Sir W. Pen’s, and there sent for a hackney-coach; and he and she and I out, to take the ayre. We went to Stepney, and there stopped at the Trinity House, he to talk with the servants there against tomorrow, which is a great day for the choice of a new Master.

1668-05-17 14:35   Home; and there I find W. Howe, and a younger brother of his; and there comes Mercer, and brings with her Mrs. Gayet; and after dinner to sing psalms. But, Lord! to hear what an excellent base this younger brother of W. Howe’s sings, even to my astonishment, and mighty pleasant.

1668-05-17 09:20   Up, and put on my new stuff-suit, with a shoulder-belt, according to the new fashion, and the bands of my vest and tunic laced with silk lace, of the colour of my suit: and so, very handsome, to Church, where a dull sermon and of a stranger.

1668-05-16 22:32   Home to supper, and to bed, after Nell’s cutting of my hair close, the weather being very hot.

1668-05-16 21:15   I to my tailor’s, and to buy me a belt for my new suit against tomorrow; and so home, and there to my Office, and afterwards late walking in the garden.

1668-05-16 17:27   I to the King’s playhouse, and there saw the best part of “The Sea Voyage,” where Knepp I see do her part of sorrow very well. I afterwards to her house; but she did not come presently home; and there yo did besar her ancilla, which is so mighty belle.

1668-05-15 18:15   I to the King’s house, and there saw the last act of “The Committee,” thinking to have seen Knepp there, but she did not act. And so to my bookseller’s, and there carried home some books-among others, “Dr. Wilkins’s Reall Character.”

1668-05-15 15:55 r But, Lord! to see among the young commanders, and Thomas Killigrew and others that come, how unlike a burial this was, O’Brian taking out some ballads out of his pocket, which I read, and the rest come about me to hear! and there very merry we were all, they being new ballets.

1668-05-15 15:45 r And here we had rings: and here I do hear that some of the last words that he said were that he had a very good King, God bless him! but that the Parliament had very ill rewarded him for all the service he had endeavoured to do them and his country.

1668-05-15 15:30   With Lord Brouncker to Loriners’-hall, by Mooregate, a hall I never heard of before, to Sir Thomas Teddiman’s burial, where most people belonging to the sea were.

1668-05-15 14:03   I to my Lord Brouncker’s, at Mrs Williams’s, and she did show me her closet which I was sorry to see for fear of her expecting something from me; and here she took notice of my wife’s not once coming to see her which I am glad of; for she shall not — a prating, vain, idle woman.

1668-05-15 10:20   To a Committee for Tangier, where God knows how my Lord Bellasses’s accounts passed; understood by nobody but my Lord Ashly, who, I believe, was mad to let them go as he pleased.

1668-05-15 08:15   Betimes to White Hall, and met with Sir H. Cholmly at Sir Stephen Fox’s, and there was also the Cofferer, and we did there consider about our money and the condition of the Excise and after much dispute agreed upon a state thereof and the manner of our future course of payments.

1668-05-14 22:10 r And then out again and walked, and it beginning to be dark, we to a corner and sang, that everybody got about us to hear us; and so home, where I saw them both at their doors, and, full of the content of this afternoon’s pleasure, I home.

1668-05-14 19:55 r And so up by water and to Fox-hall, where we walked a great while, and pleased mightily with the pleasure thereof, and the company there, and then in, and eat and drank.

1668-05-14 17:30 r Into the playhouse again, and there saw “The Country Captain,” a very dull play, that did give us no content, and besides, little company there, which made it very unpleasing.

1668-05-14 13:50   To Penny’s, my tailor’s, where by agreement Mercer, and she, to my great content, brings Mrs. Gayet, and I carried them to the King’s house; but, coming too soon, we out again to the Rose tavern, and there I did give them a tankard of cool drink, the weather being very hot.

1668-05-13 22:30   To Michell’s, and did see her and drink there, but he being there yo no puede besar la; and so back again by water to Spring Garden all alone, and walked a little, and so back again home, and there a little to my viall, and so to bed, Mrs. Turner having sat and supped with me.

1668-05-13 15:32 r Which, for my part, I think a piece of folly for them to meddle with, because the secret cannot be long kept.

1668-05-13 15:30   And so to attend the Council about the business of Hemskirke’s project of building a ship that sails two feet for one of any other ship, which the Council did agree to be put in practice, the King to give him, if it proves good, 5000l. in hand, and 15,000l. more in seven years.

1668-05-13 10:48   Into the Park, and there met Sir H. Cholmly, and he and I to Sir Stephen Fox’s, where we met and considered the business of the Excise, how far it is charged in reference to the payment of the Guards and Tangier.

1668-05-13 09:20   I hear that last night Sir Thomas Teddiman, poor man! did die by a thrush in his mouth: a good man, and stout and able, and much lamented; though people do make a little mirth, and say, as I believe it did in good part, that the business of the Parliament did break his heart.

1668-05-12 21:30 r And so parted, I having there seen a mummy in a merchant’s warehouse, all the middle of the man or woman’s body, black and hard. I never saw any before, and, therefore, it pleased me much, though an ill sight; and he did give me a little bit, and a bone of an arme, I suppose.

1668-05-12 21:10 r By moonshine with infinite pleasure home, and there sang again in Mercer’s garden.

1668-05-12 19:10 r After sitting and talking a little, I took them out, and carried them through Hackney to Kingsland, and there walked to Sir G. Whitmore’s house, where I have not been many a day; and so to the old house at Islington, and eat, and drank, and sang, and mighty merry.

1668-05-12 16:50 r And then to Mrs. Mercer’s, where I met with her two daughters, and a pretty lady I never knew yet, one Mrs. Susan Gayet, a very pretty lady, that speaks French well, and is a Catholic, and merchant’s daughter, by us, and here was also Mrs. Anne Jones.

1668-05-12 15:10   Creed and I, by water to the Temple, where we parted, and I both to the King’s and Duke of York’s playhouses, and there went through the houses to see what faces I could spy that I knew, and meeting none, I away by coach to my house.

1668-05-11 22:16 r So by water, with great pleasure, down to the Bridge, and there landed, and took water again on the other side; and so to the Tower, and I saw her home, I myself home to my chamber, and by and by to bed.

1668-05-11 20:02 r I took Mercer by water to Spring Garden; and there with pleasure walked, and eat, and drank, and sang, making people come about us, to hear us, and two little children of one of our neighbours that happened to be there, did come into our arbour, and we made them dance prettily.

1668-05-11 16:23 r But, however, I did deny it, and did not pay her; but, for quiet, did buy 4s. worth of oranges of her, at 6d. a-piece.

1668-05-11 16:20 r But there happened one thing which vexed me which is that the orange-woman did come in the pit, and challenge me for twelve oranges which she delivered by my order at a late play, at night, to give to some ladies in a box, which was wholly untrue but yet she swore it to be true.

1668-05-11 16:03 r But now I have got the words clear, and, in going in thither, had the pleasure to see the actors in their several dresses, especially the seamen and monster, which were very droll: so into the play again.

1668-05-11 16:00 r Between two acts, I went out to Mr. Harris, and got him to repeat to me the words of the Echo, while I writ them down, having tried in the play to have wrote them; but, when I had done it, having done it without looking upon my paper, I find I could not read the blacklead.

1668-05-11 14:40   I to dinner with Balty and his wife, who is come to town to-day from Deptford to see us, and after dinner I out and took a coach, and called Mercer, and she and I to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there saw “The Tempest,”

1668-05-11 12:10   This day Kate Joyce was to be married to a man called Hollingshed, whom she indeed did once tell me of, and desired me to enquire after him. But, whatever she said of his being rich, I do fear it is not as it ought to be; but, as she brews, let her bake.

1668-05-10 20:26 r But yo did besar la and tocar sus mamelles, ella being poco shy but doth speak con mighty kindness to me that she would desire me por su marido if it were to be done.

1668-05-10 20:24 r At the Tower wharf there we did send for a pair of old shoes for Mrs. Lowther, and there I did pull the others off and put them on, and did endeavour para tocar su thigh but ella had drawers on.

1668-05-10 19:40 r And so to water again, and set down the old woman at home at Durham Yard: and it raining all the way, it troubled us; but, however, my cloak kept us all dry, and so home.

1668-05-10 18:20   I took my Lady Pen, and Mrs. Lowther, and old Mrs. Whistler, her mother-in-law, by water with great pleasure as far as Chelsy, and so back to Spring Garden, at Fox-hall, and there walked, and eat, and drank.

1668-05-10 14:30   I to church, and so home, and there comes W. Hewer and Balty, and by and by I sent for Mercer to come and dine with me, and pretty merry, and after dinner I fell to teach her “Canite Jehovae,” which she did a great part presently.

1668-05-10 11:00   Mr. Shepley, newly come to town, come to see me, and did by the by as he would seem tell me that my Lady Sandwich had it in her thoughts, if she had occasion, to borrow 100l. of me, which I did not declare any opposition to, though I doubt it will be so much lost.

1668-05-09 19:40   I did talk with Mrs. Lowther, who is very kind to me, more than usual, and I will make use of it. She begins to draw very well, and I think do as well, if not better, than my wife, if it be true that she do it herself, what she shews me.

1668-05-09 18:10   I towards the New Exchange and there bought a pair of black silk stockings at the hosier’s that hath the very pretty woman to his wife, about ten doors on this side of the ’Change, and she is indeed very pretty but I think a notable talking woman by what I heard to others there.

1668-05-09 17:20   Sir W. Pen and I into the King’s house, and there “The Mayd’s Tragedy,” a good play, but Knepp not there; and my head and eyes out of order, the first from my drinking wine at dinner, and the other from my much work in the morning.

1668-05-09 12:05 r Here we are told also that last night the Duchesse of Monmouth, dancing at her lodgings, hath sprained her thigh.

1668-05-09 11:58   Up, and to the office, where all the morning we sat. Here I first hear that the Queene hath miscarryed of a perfect child, being gone about ten weeks, which do shew that she can conceive, though it be unfortunate that she cannot bring forth.

1668-05-08 21:10   Brouncker, Pen, and I to Brouncker’s house, and there sat and talked, I asking many questions in mathematics to my Lord, which he do me the pleasure to satisfy me in, and here we drank and so spent an hour, and so W. Pen and I home.

1668-05-08 13:33   My Lord Crew tells me that there are great disputes like to be at Court, between the factions of the two women, my Lady Castlemayne and Mrs. Stewart, and the King hath made several public visits to her, and like to come to Court: the other is to go to Barkeshire-house.

1668-05-07 22:34 r And so set Mrs. Knepp at her lodging, and so the rest, and I home talking with a great deal of pleasure, and so home to bed.

1668-05-07 21:45 r But endeavouring afterward to tocar her con mi cosa, ella did strive against that, but yet I do not think that she did find much fault with it, but I was a little moved at my offering it and not having it.

1668-05-07 21:40 r And so home by moonshine, I all the way having mi mano abaxo la jupe de Knepp con much placer and freedom.

1668-05-07 20:45 r Here was also Haynes, the incomparable dancer of the King’s house, and a seeming civil man, and sings pretty well, and they gone, we abroad to Marrowbone, and there walked in the garden, the first time I ever was there; and a pretty place it is, and here we eat and drank.

1668-05-07 19:20 r Here took up Knepp into our coach, and all of us with her to her lodgings, and thither comes Bannister with a song of hers, that he hath set in Sir Charles Sidly’s play for her; this he did teach her, and it being but a slight, silly, short ayre, she learnt it presently.

1668-05-07 17:58 r Lord! their confidence! and how many men do hover about them as soon as they come off the stage, and how confident they are in their talk! I did kiss the pretty woman newly come, called Pegg, that was Sir Charles Sidly’s mistress, a pretty woman, and seems, but is not, modest.

1668-05-07 17:47 r Thence called Knepp from the King’s house, where going in for her, the play being done, I did see Beck Marshall come dressed, off of the stage, and looks mighty fine, and pretty, and noble: and also Nell, in her boy’s clothes, mighty pretty.

1668-05-07 17:20   I sent for Mercer to dine with me, and after dinner she and I called Mrs. Turner, and I carried them to the Duke of York’s house, and there saw “The Man’s the Master,” which proves, upon my seeing it again, a very good play.

1668-05-06 21:10 r And there, ponendo the key in the door, yo tocar sus mamelles con mi mano and su cosa with me cosa et yo did dar-la a shilling, and so parted, and yo home to put up things against tomorrow’s carrier for my wife.

1668-05-06 20:48 r I did see our Nell, Payne’s daughter, and her yo did desear venga after migo, and so ella did seque me to Tower Hill to our back entry there that comes upon the degres entrant into nostra garden.

1668-05-06 20:20 r I did walk in the dusk up and down, round through our garden, over Tower Hill, and through Crutched Friars, three or four times, and did meet Mercer and another pretty lady, but being surprized I could say little, although I had an opportunity of pleasing myself, but left them.

1668-05-06 19:22 r And there I found her on a pallet in the dark, where yo did poner mi manos under her jupe and tocar su cosa and waked her; that is Knepp. And so to talk; and by and by did eat some curds and cream, and thence away home.

1668-05-06 18:10   I back to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Virgin Martyr,” and heard the music that I like so well, and intended to have seen Knepp, but I let her alone; and having there done, went to Mrs. Pierces back again, where she was.

1668-05-06 13:50   By water to the New Exchange, where bought a pair of shoe-strings, and so to Mr. Pierces, where invited, and there was Knepp and Mrs. Foster and here dined, but a poor, sluttish dinner, as usual, and so I could not be heartily merry at it.

1668-05-06 11:04   This morning the House is upon the City Bill, and they say hath passed it, though I am sorry that I did not think to put somebody in mind of moving for the churches to be allotted according to the convenience of the people, and not to gratify this Bishop, or that College.

1668-05-06 10:10   I met Mrs. Washington, my old acquaintance of the Hall, whose husband has a place in the Excise at Windsor, and it seems lives well. I have not seen her these 8 or 9 years, and she begins to grow old, I perceive, visibly. So time do alter, and do doubtless the like in myself.

1668-05-05 17:35 r One thing of familiarity I observed in my Lady Castlemayne: she called to one of her women, for a little patch off her face, and put it into her mouth and wetted it, and so clapped it upon her own by the side of her mouth, I suppose she feeling a pimple rising there.

1668-05-05 17:28 r My Lady pretty well pleased with it; but here I sat close to her fine woman, Willson, who indeed is very handsome, but, they say, with child by the King.

1668-05-05 17:20 r There we sat with them, and I saw “The Impertinents” once more, now three times, and the three only days it hath been acted. And to see the folly how the house do this day cry up the play more than yesterday! and I for that reason like it, I find, the better, too.

1668-05-05 14:15   Creed and I to the Duke of York’s playhouse; and there coming late, he and I up to the balcony-box, where we find my Lady Castlemayne and several great ladies.

1668-05-04 20:58 r Mrs. Pierce called me from the gallery, and I took her and Mrs. Corbet by coach up and down, and took up Captain Rolt; and at last I carried them to the Beare in Drury Lane, and there did treat them with a dish of mackrell, the first I have seen this year, and mighty merry.

1668-05-04 17:13   To the Duke of York’s house, and there saw “The Impertinents” again, and with less pleasure than before, it being but a very contemptible play, though there are many little witty expressions in it; and the pit did generally say that of it.

1668-05-04 09:20   To the Duke, and there present Balty to the Duke of York and a letter from the Board to him about him, and the Duke of York is mightily pleased with him, and I doubt not his continuance in employment, which I am glad of.

1668-05-03 19:10 r Thence Pen and I to Islington, and there, at the old house, eat, and drank, and merry, and there by chance giving two pretty fat boys each of them a cake, they proved to be Captain Holland’s children, whom therefore I pity.

1668-05-03 17:40   With Sir W. Pen took a hackney, and he and I to Old Street, to a brew-house there, to see Sir Thomas Teddiman, who is very ill in bed of a fever, got, I believe, by the fright the Parliament have put him into, of late. But he is a good man, a good seaman, and stout.

1668-05-03 15:27   To church again where I did please myself con mes ojos shut in futar in conceit the hook-nosed young lady, a merchant’s daughter, in the upper pew in the church under the pulpit.

1668-05-03 13:32   At noon comes Mr. Mills and his wife, and Mr. Turner and his wife, by invitation to dinner, and we were mighty merry, and a very pretty dinner, of my Bridget and Nell’s dressing, very handsome.

1668-05-03 09:03   To church, where I saw Sir A. Rickard, though he be under the Black Rod, by order of the Lords’ House, upon the quarrel between the East India Company and Skinner, which is like to come to a very great heat between the two Houses.

1668-05-02 22:10 r And so home to the Office, ended my letters, and, to spare my eyes, home, and played on my pipes, and so to bed.

1668-05-02 21:03 r Thence to the King’s house to see Knepp, but the play done; and so I took a hackney alone, and to the park, and there spent the evening, and to the lodge, and drank new milk.

1668-05-02 17:25 r But a little boy, for a farce, do dance Polichinelli, the best that ever anything was done in the world, by all men’s report: most pleased with that, beyond anything in the world, and much beyond all the play.

1668-05-02 17:21 r But I had my place, and by and by the King comes and the Duke of York; and then the play begins, called “The Sullen Lovers; or, The Impertinents,” having many good humours in it, but the play tedious, and no design at all in it.

1668-05-02 13:15   To the Duke of York’s playhouse, at a little past twelve, to get a good place in the pit, against the new play, and there setting a poor man to keep my place, I out, and spent an hour at Martin’s, my bookseller’s, and so back again, where I find the house quite full.

1668-05-01 22:10   By water, not being able to get a coach, nor boat but a sculler, and that with company, it being so foul a day, to the Old Swan, and so home, and there spent the evening, making Balty read to me, and so to supper and to bed.

1668-05-01 17:02   To Hercules Pillars, and there dined all alone, and then to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Surprizall;” and a disorder in the pit by its raining in, from the cupola at top, it being a very foul day, and cold, so as there are few I believe go to the Park today, if any.

1668-05-01 12:22   I met my cozen Thomas Pepys of Deptford, and took some turns with him; who is mightily troubled for this Act now passed against Conventicles, and in few words, and sober, do lament the condition we are in, by a negligent Prince and a mad Parliament.

1668-05-01 11:50   I met Sir W. Pen, who labours to have his answer to his impeachment, and sent down from the Lords’ House, read by the House of Commons; but they are so busy on other matters, that he cannot, and thereby will, as he believes, by design, be prevented from going to sea this year.
