1668-02-29 21:03   Wrote to my father this post, and sent him now Colvill’s note for 600l. for my sister’s portion, being glad that I shall have that business over before I am out of place, and I trust I shall be able to save a little of what I have got; for I am weary of this life.

1668-02-29 15:15   To the office where we met to consider of an answer to the Parliament about the not paying of tickets according to our own orders, to which I hope we shall be able to give a satisfactory answer, but I do question whether the best answer will prevail with them.

1668-02-29 09:31 r La Roche had the boldness to land some men and go a mile up into the country, and there took some goods belonging to this prize out of a house there; which our King resents, and hath wrote to the King of France about; and everybody do think a war will follow.

1668-02-29 09:24   Captain Cocke and Sir G. Carteret tell me how Sir Thomas Allen hath taken the Englishmen out of “La Roche,” and taken from him an Ostend prize which La Roche had fetched out of our harbours; and at this day La Roche keeps upon our coasts.

1668-02-28 18:42 r That that made the House so mad today first was, several letters in the House about the Fanatickes in several places, coming in great bodies, and turning people out of the churches, and there preaching themselves, and pulling the surplice over the Parsons’ heads.

1668-02-28 17:23 r My cozen Roger did tell me the same over again; and how much Birch did stand up in our defence; and that he do see that there are many desirous to have us out of the Office; and the House is so furious and passionate, that he thinks nobody can be secure.

1668-02-28 16:30 r Colonel Birch took me back to walk with him and did give me an account of this day’s heat against the Navy Officers, and an account of his speech on our behalf, which was very good; and indeed we are much beholden to him.

1668-02-28 15:40   Mr. Wren tells us a storm hath been against the Officers of the Navy upon this complaint, that though they have made good rules for payment of tickets, they have not observed them themselves, which was driven so high as to have it urged that we should be put out of our places.

1668-02-28 14:28   With Sir W. Pen to White Hall, where we and the rest of us presented a great letter of the state of our want of money to his Royal Highness. I did also present a demand of mine for consideration for my travelling-charges of coach and boat-hire during the war.

1668-02-27 21:03 r Neither then nor all the evening, I was able to think of any thing, but remained transported, so as I could not believe that ever any music hath that command over the soul of a man as this did upon me: and makes me resolve to practice wind-music and to make my wife do the like.

1668-02-27 17:14 r But that which did please me beyond any thing in the whole world was the wind-musique when the angel comes down, which is so sweet that it ravished me, and indeed, did wrap up my soul so that it made me really sick, just as I have formerly been when in love with my wife.

1668-02-27 17:10   With my wife and Deb. to the King’s House, to see “The Virgin Martyr,” the first time it hath been acted a great while: and it is mighty pleasant; not that the play is worth much, but it is finely acted by Becke Marshall.

1668-02-26 20:12 r Duncomb did swear that in France he did live of 100l. a year with more plenty, and wine and wenches, than he believes can be done now for 200l., which was pretty odd for him, being a Committee-man’s son, to say.

1668-02-26 19:47 r To Sir W. Coventry’s lodgings. And here a great deal of good discourse: and they seem mighty glad to have this vote pass, which I did wonder at, to see them so well satisfied with so small a sum, Sir John Duncomb swearing that it was as much as the nation could beare.

1668-02-26 18:05   The House with great difficulty have got a vote for giving the King 300,000l, not to be raised by any land-tax. The sum is smaller than I expected and than the King needs; but is grounded upon Mr. Wren’s reading our estimates the other day of 270,000l, to keep the fleete abroad.

1668-02-26 13:48 r After dinner comes W. Howe to tell me how he sped, who says he was used civilly, and not so many questions asked as he expected; but yet I do perceive enough to shew that they do intend to know the bottom of things.

1668-02-26 10:20   I did meet W. Howe going to the Commissioners of Accounts. I stopped and spoke to him, and he seems well resolved what to answer them, but he will find them very strict, and not easily put off.

1668-02-25 18:10   To the New Exchange, to take some things home that my wife hath bought, a dressing-box, and other things for her chamber and table, that cost me above 4l, and so home.

1668-02-25 17:03   I took my wife and Deb. to the Nursery and there saw them act a comedy, a pastorall, “The Faythful Shepherd,” having the curiosity to see whether they did a comedy better than a tragedy; but they do it both alike, in the meanest manner, that I was sick of it.

1668-02-24 17:24 r I was prettily served at the playhouse-door. Giving six shillings into the fellow’s hand he by legerdemain did convey one away and with so much grace faced me down that I did give him but five. I was overpowered by his so grave demanding the other, that I could not deny him.

1668-02-24 17:18 r Their play was a bad one, called “Jeronimo is Mad Again,” a tragedy. Here was some good company by us, who did make mighty sport at the folly of their acting, which I could not neither refrain from sometimes, though I was sorry for it.

1668-02-24 17:16 r However, I was pleased well to see it once, it being worth a man’s seeing to discover the different ability and understanding of people, and the different growth of people’s abilities by practise.

1668-02-24 17:14   I took my wife and Deb. to the Nursery, where none of us ever were before; where the house is better and the musique better than we looked for, and the acting not much worse, because I expected as bad as could be: and I was not much mistaken, for it was so.

1668-02-24 13:50 r Here I saw the organ; but it is too big for my house, and the fashion do not please me enough; and therefore will not have it.

1668-02-24 13:30   Dr. Gibbons and I to see an organ at the Dean of Westminster’s lodgings at the Abby, the Bishop of Rochester’s; where he lives like a great prelate, his lodgings being very good; though at present under great disgrace at Court, being put by his Clerk of the Closet’s place.

1668-02-24 12:03   With my wife to the New Exchange, by the way stopping at my bookseller’s, and there leaving my Kircher’s Musurgia to be bound, and did buy “L’illustre Bassa,” in four volumes, for my wife.

1668-02-24 06:15   I anon to bed, and there, as I have for many days, slept not an hour quietly, but full of dreams of our defence to the Parliament and giving an account of our doings.

1668-02-23 21:00   My wife did with pleasure show me her stock of jewells, encreased by the ring she hath made as my Valentine’s gift, and she reckons that she hath above 150l. worth of jewells; and I am glad of it, for it is fit the wretch should have something to content herself with.

1668-02-23 17:20   With W. Pen homeward, and quite through to Mile End, for a little ayre; the days being now pretty long, but the ways mighty dirty, and here we drank at the Rose, the old house, and so back again, talking of the Parliament and our trouble with them and what passed yesterday.

1668-02-23 14:30   Finding a meeting of the Committee of the Council for the Navy, and it was to be informed of the practice heretofore, for all foreign nations, at enmity one with another, to forbear any acts of hostility to one another, in the presence of any of the King of England’s ships.

1668-02-23 10:10 r I met with Sir W. Coventry, and he told me all the proceedings yesterday: that the matter is found, in general, a miscarriage, but no persons named; and so there is no great matter to our prejudice yet, till, if ever, they come to particular persons.

1668-02-23 09:04 r To Court, where sermon not yet done I met with Brisband; and he tells me, first, that our business of tickets did come to debate yesterday, it seems, after I was gone away, and was voted a miscarriage in general.

1668-02-23 08:14   Up, and, being desired by a messenger from Sir G. Carteret, I by water over to Southwarke, and so walked to the Falkon, on the Bank-side, and there got a boat, and so to Westminster, where I would have gone into the Swan; but the door was locked and the girl could not let me in.

1668-02-22 17:05 r To the Duke’s playhouse, and there saw “Albumazar,” an old play. It is said to have been the ground of B. Jonson’s “Alchymist;” but, saving the ridicuiousnesse of Angell’s part, which is called Trinkilo, I do not see any thing extraordinary in it, but was indeed weary of it.

1668-02-22 13:33 r In the mean time, sat and sung with Mercer; and, by and by, dined with mighty pleasure, and excellent meat, one little dish enough for us all, and good wine, and all for 8s.

1668-02-22 12:20 r They being busy about my Lord Gerard’s business I did give over the thoughts of ours coming on, and so with my wife, and Mercer, and Deb, who come to the Hall to me, I away to the Beare, in Drury Lane, and there bespoke a dish of meat.

1668-02-22 12:02   To the Lords’ House, and heard the Solicitor-General plead finely; and this was in defence of the East India Company against a man that complains of wrong from them, and thus up and down till noon in expectation of our business coming on in the House of Commons about tickets.

1668-02-22 09:02   Up, and by coach through Ducke Lane, and there did buy Kircher’s Musurgia, cost me 35s., a book I am mighty glad of, expecting to find great satisfaction in it.

1668-02-21 22:12   I away home to the office, and there busy pretty late, and here comes my wife to me, who hath been at Pegg Pen’s christening, which, she says, hath made a flutter and noise; but was as mean as could be, and but little company, just like all the rest that that family do.

1668-02-21 15:20   To Westminster Hall, and there met with Colonel Birch and Sir John Lowther, and did there read over what I have drawn up for our defence, wherein they own themselves mightily satisfied; and Birch do take it upon him to defend us, and do mightily do me right in all his discourse.

1668-02-21 08:37 r I told him I had not done him any service I knew of. He persisted, and I refused, but did at several denials; and telling him that it was not an age to take presents in, he told me he had reason to present me with something, and desired me to accept of it, which I did.

1668-02-21 08:34   Comes to me young Captain Beckford, the slopseller, and there presents me a little purse with gold in it, it being, as he told me, for his present to me, at the end of the last year.

1668-02-20 17:00 r The play designed to reproach our King with his mistresses, that I was troubled for it, and expected it should be interrupted; but it ended all well. The play a well-writ and good play, only its design I did not like of reproaching the King, but altogether a very good play.

1668-02-20 13:24 r Thence by one o’clock to the King’s house: a new play, “The Duke of Lerma,” of Sir Robert Howard’s: where the King and Court was; and Knepp and Nell spoke the prologue most excellently, especially Knepp, who spoke beyond any creature I ever, heard.

1668-02-20 12:47 r So down to the Hall, where my wife by agreement stayed for me at Mrs. Michell’s, and there was Mercer and the girl, and I took them to Wilkinson’s the cook’s in King Street (where I find the master of the house hath been dead for some time), and there dined.

1668-02-20 11:50 r It fell out that they were most of the morning upon the business of not prosecuting the first victory; which they have voted one of the greatest miscarriages of the whole war, though they cannot lay the fault anywhere yet. This kept them all the morning, which I was glad of.

1668-02-20 11:45   I by water to Westminster Hall, and there with Lord Brouncker, Sir T. Harvy, Sir J. Minnes, did wait all the morning to speak to members about our business, thinking our business of tickets would come before the House today.

1668-02-19 23:13   Home, and there my mind being full of preparing my paper against tomorrow for the House, with an address from the office to the House, I to the office, very late, and then home to supper and to bed.

1668-02-19 17:04   All the Court is full of the good news of my Lord Sandwich’s having made a peace between Spain and Portugall, which is great news and, to my Lord’s honour, more than any thing he ever did; yet I do fear it will not prevail to secure him in Parliament against incivilities there.

1668-02-19 15:30   La Roche, a French captain who was once prisoner here, being with his ship at Plymouth, hath played some reakes there, for which his men being beat out of the town, he hath put up his flag of defiance, and also did land with his men and go into the country, and did some pranks.

1668-02-19 12:10   Up, and to the office, where all the morning drawing up an answer to the Report of the Committee for miscarriages to the Parliament touching our paying men by tickets, which I did do in a very good manner I think.

1668-02-18 20:14   To my wife and she shows me her ring of a Turky-stone set with sparks of dyamonds which I am to give her, as my Valentine, and I am not much troubled at it. It will cost me 5l. she costing me but little compared with other wives, and I have not many occasions to spend on her.

1668-02-18 18:40   I find Kate Joyce in ease of mind, the jury having given in their verdict that her husband died of a feaver. Some opposition there was, but they did adhere to their verdict, and would give no reason; so all trouble is now over, and she safe in her estate, which I am glad of.

1668-02-18 17:25 r Thence, he and I to the King’s house, and there saw “Flora’s Vagarys,” which is a very silly play; and the more, I being out of humour, being at a play without my wife, and she ill at home, and having no desire also to be seen, and, therefore, could not look about me.

1668-02-18 13:52   I to the Hall, and there met Sir W. Pen, and he and I to the Beare, in Drury Lane, an excellent ordinary, after the French manner, but of Englishmen; and there had a good fricassee, our dinner coming to 8s, which was mighty pretty, to my great content.

1668-02-18 12:50   To the Dog Tavern, and thither come to me Doll Lane, and there we did drink, and she tells me she is my valentine; and there I did tocar sa cosa and might have done whatever else yo voudrais but there was nothing but only chairs in the room and so we were unable para hazer algo.

1668-02-18 11:55   To Westminster Hall, and there did speak with several Parliament-men — among others, Birch, who is very kind to me, and calls me, with great respect and kindness, a man of business, and he thinks honest, and so long will stand by me, and every such man, to the death.

1668-02-18 09:28 r He tells me that Sir Fr. Hollis is the man that hath persecuted him, saying vainly that the want of that letter to the Prince hath given him that, that he shall remember it by to his grave, meaning the loss of his arme; when he is as idle a fellow as ever come into the fleet.

1668-02-18 09:20 r Sir W. Coventry expects next to be troubled about the business of bad officers in the fleet, wherein he will bid them name whom they call bad, and he will justify himself, having never disposed of any but by the Admiral’s liking.

1668-02-18 09:15   To Sir W. Coventry’s, and talked with him, who tells me how he hath been persecuted, and how he is yet well come off in the business of the dividing of the fleet, and the sending of the letter.

1668-02-18 08:15   Up by break of day, and walked down to the old Swan, where I find little Michell building, his booth being taken down, and a foundation laid for a new house, so that that street is like to be a very fine place.

1668-02-17 22:40   Home, and there up to my wife, who is still ill, and supped with her, my mind being mighty full of trouble for the office, and so to supper and talking with W. Hewer about business of the office, and it do me advantage to talk with him and the rest of my people.

1668-02-17 21:50 r Some mutterings I did hear of a design of dissolving the Parliament; but I think there is no ground for it yet, though Oliver would have dissolved them for half the trouble and contempt these have put upon the King and his councils.

1668-02-17 21:42   I to Westminster Hall, and there spent till late at night walking to and again with many people, and there in general I hear of the great high words that were in the House on Saturday last, upon the first part of the Committee’s Report about the dividing of the fleet.

1668-02-17 12:03   Up, and to the office, where all the morning till noon getting some things more ready against the afternoon for the Committee of Accounts, which did give me great trouble, to see how I am forced to dance after them in one place, and to answer Committees of Parliament in another.

1668-02-16 22:12   After dinner to have my head combed, and then to my chamber and read most of the evening till pretty late, when, my wife not being well, I did lie below stairs in our great chamber.

1668-02-16 13:32 r Much discourse also about the bad state of the Church, and how the Clergy are come to be men of no worth in the world; and, as the world do now generally discourse, they must be reformed; and I believe the Hierarchy will in a little time be shaken, whether they will or no.

1668-02-16 13:14   Mr. Holliard put in, and dined with my wife and me, who was a little better to-day. His company very good. His story of his love and fortune, which hath been very good and very bad in the world, well worth hearing.

1668-02-16 11:57   Up, and to my chamber, where all the morning making a catalogue of my books, which did find me work, but with great pleasure, my chamber and books being now set in very good order, and my chamber washed and cleaned, which it had not been in some months before.

1668-02-16 06:02   My wife taking some physic overnight it wrought with her, and those coming upon her with great gripes, she was in pain all night, yet, God forgive me! I did find that I was most desirous to take my rest than to ease her, but there was nothing I could do to do her any good with.

1668-02-15 23:51   All the afternoon and evening till midnight almost, and till I had tired my own backe, and my wife’s, and Deb.’s, in titleing of my books for the present year, and in setting them in order, which is now done to my very good satisfaction.

1668-02-15 07:40   Up betimes, and with Captain Cocke my coach to the Temple to his Counsel again about the prize goods in order to the drawing up of his answer to them, where little done but a confirmation that our best interest is for him to tell the whole truth.

1668-02-14 21:45   I was told tonight that my Lady Castlemayne is so great a gamester as to have won 15,000l. in one night, and lost 25,000l. in another night, at play, and hath played 1000l. and 1500l. at a cast.

1668-02-14 19:47   The House is in a most broken condition; nobody adhering to any thing, but reviling and finding fault: and now quite mad at the Undertakers, as they are called, Littleton, Lord Vaughan, Sir R. Howard, that are brought over to the Court, and did undertake to get the King money.

1668-02-14 19:20   Secretary Morrice did in the House, when they talked of intelligence, say that he was allowed but 700l. a-year for intelligence, whereas in Cromwell’s time, he did allow 70,000l.; and that thereby Cromwell carried the secrets of all the princes of Europe at his girdle.

1668-02-14 15:58   To White Hall, to attend the Duke of York, where I did let him know, too, the troublesome life we lead, and particularly myself, by being obliged to such attendances every day as I am, on one Committee or another.

1668-02-14 06:55 r There comes also my cozen Roger Pepys betimes, and comes to my wife, for her to be his Valentine, whose Valentine I was also, by agreement to be so to her every year; and this year I find it is likely to cost 4l. or 5l. in a ring for her, which she desires.

1668-02-14 06:50   Up, being called up by Mercer, who come to be my Valentine, and so I rose and my wife, and were merry a little, I staying to talk, and did give her a guinny in gold for her Valentine’s gift.

1668-02-13 16:15   Mr. Brisband tells me in discourse that Tom Killigrew hath a fee out of the Wardrobe for cap and bells, under the title of the King’s Foole or jester; and may with privilege revile or jeere any body, the greatest person, without offence, by the privilege of his place.

1668-02-13 15:20   I to the Commissioners of the Treasury, where myself alone did argue the business of the East India Company against their whole Company on behalf of the King before the Lords Commissioners, and to very good effect, I think, and with reputation.

1668-02-12 22:03   Going to the gate with Mr. Houblon, I found his lady and another fine lady sitting an hour together, late at night, in their coach, while he was with me, which is so like my wife, that I was mighty taken with it, though troubled for it.

1668-02-12 17:03   Captain Cocke was with the Commissioners of Accounts to ask more time for his bringing in his answer about the prize goods, and they would not give him fourteen days as he asks, but would give only two days, which was hard, I think, and did trouble me for fear of their severity.

1668-02-12 12:05   All the morning drawing up my narrative of my proceedings in the buying of prize-goods, which I am to present to the Committee for Accounts; and being come to a resolution to conceal nothing from them, I was at great ease how to draw it up without any inventions or practise.

1668-02-11 18:54 r It was pretty to see the heaps of money upon this lawyer’s table; and to see how he had not since last night spent any time upon our business, but begun with telling us that we were not at all concerned in that Act; which was a mistake by his not having read over the Act at all.

1668-02-11 18:47   To the Temple, to Porter’s chamber, where Cocke met me, and after a stay there some time, they two and I to Pemberton’s chamber, and there did read over the Act of calling people to account, and did discourse all our business of the prizes.

1668-02-11 17:22   With Lord Brouncker, and set him down at Bow Streete, and so to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there saw the last act for nothing, where I never saw such good acting of any creature as Smith’s part of Zanger.

1668-02-11 14:58   To Westminster Hall, and sent my wife and Deb. to see “Mustapha” acted. I brought a book to the Committee, and do find them, and particularly Sir Thomas Clarges, hot in the business of tickets, which makes me mad to see them bite at the stone, and not at the hand that flings it.

1668-02-11 12:40   Home to dinner, where little pleasure, my head being split almost with the variety of troubles upon me at this time, and cares.

1668-02-11 11:50   At the office all the morning, where comes a damned summons to attend the Committee of Miscarriages today, which makes me mad, that I should by my place become the hackney of this Office, in perpetual trouble and vexation, that need it least.

1668-02-11 06:47 r And my wife hath charged him to go on with his love to her, and be true to her, and so I think the business will go on, which, for my love to her, because she is in love with him, I am pleased with.

1668-02-11 06:45   My wife in bed told me the story of our Tom and Jane: how the rogue did first demand her consent to love and marry him, and then, with pretence of displeasing me, did slight her; but both he and she have confessed the matter to her.

1668-02-10 21:57   I home, and there got my wife to read a book I bought today, and come out today licensed by Joseph Williamson for Lord Arlington, shewing the state of England’s affairs relating to France at this time, and the whole body of the book very good and solid.

1668-02-10 15:50   To Westminster Hall, and there met Roger Pepys, and with him to his chamber, and there read over and agreed upon the Deed of Settlement to our minds: my sister to have 600l. presently, and she to be joyntured in 60l. per annum; wherein I am very well satisfied.

1668-02-10 11:28 r By and by the King comes to the Lords’ House, and there tells them of his league with Holland, and the necessity of a fleet, and his debts; and, therefore, want of money.

1668-02-10 10:47 r It was moved in the House that, if any people had a mind to bring any new laws into the House, about religion, they might come, as a proposer of new laws did in Athens, with ropes about their necks.

1668-02-10 10:32   The House of Commons met; and upon information given them of a Bill intended to be brought in, they did mightily inveigh against it, and did vote that the King should be desired by the House that the laws against breakers of the Act of Uniformity should be put in execution.

1668-02-10 09:08   Made a visit to Mr. Godolphin, at his chamber; and I do find him a very pretty and able person, a man of very fine parts, and of infinite zeal to my Lord Sandwich; and one that says he is, he believes, as wise and able a person as any prince in the world hath.

1668-02-09 21:15   I to my chamber, where I did read through “L’escholle des filles,” a lewd book, but what doth me no wrong once to read for information sake (but it did hazer my prick para stand all the while, and una vez to decharger). And after I had done it I burned it.

1668-02-09 19:00   I must remember that Pegg Pen was brought to bed yesterday of a girl; and, among other things, that hardly ever was remembered such a season for the smallpox as these last two months have been, people being seen all up and down the streets, newly come out after the smallpox.

1668-02-09 17:49 r …and with the rests that the words are set, there is no sense nor understanding in them though they be English, which makes me weary of singing in that manner, it being but a worse sort of instrumental music.

1668-02-09 17:47 r We into our dining-room, and there to singing all the afternoon. But though they sang fine things, yet I must confess that I did take no pleasure in it, or very little, because I understood not the words…

1668-02-09 12:15   Home to dinner, where by appointment Mr. Pelling come and with him three friends, Wallington, that sings the good base, and one Rogers, and a gentleman, a young man, his name Tempest, who sings very well indeed, and understands anything in the world at first sight.

1668-02-09 11:58   Up, and at my chamber all the morning and the office doing business, and also reading a little of “L’escholle des filles,” which is a mighty lewd book, but yet not amiss for a sober man once to read over to inform himself in the villainy of the world.

1668-02-08 19:02   My wife well pleased with my sister’s match, and designing how to be merry at their marriage. And I am well at ease in my mind to think that that care will be over.

1668-02-08 16:12   To my bookseller’s, and bought the idle, rogueish book, “L’escholle des filles” which I have bought in plain binding, because I resolve, as soon as I have read it, to burn it, that it may not stand in the list of books, nor among them, to disgrace them if it should be found.

1668-02-08 13:22 r The great talk is of Carr’s coming off in all his trials, to the disgrace of my Lord Gerard, to that degree, and the ripping up of so many notorious rogueries and cheats of my Lord’s, that my Lord, it is thought, will be ruined.

1668-02-08 12:50   Home, and there find cozen Roger and Jackson by appointment come to dine with me, and Creed, and very merry, only Jackson hath few words, and I like him never the worse for it.

1668-02-07 17:27 r My Lord Brouncker, and W. Pen, and I, and with us Sir Arnold Breames, to the King’s playhouse, and there saw a piece of “Love in a Maze,” a dull, silly play, I think.

1668-02-07 15:04   To the Duke of York’s chamber, where I find him and my fellows at their usual meeting, discoursing about securing the Medway this year, which is to shut the door after the horse is stole. However, it is good.

1668-02-07 14:30 r So there parted, my mind pretty well satisfied with this plain fellow for my sister, though I shall, I see, have no pleasure nor content in him, as if he had been a man of reading and parts, like Cumberland.

1668-02-07 14:20   I to Westminster Hall, by appointment, and there met my cozen Roger again, and Mr. Jackson, who is a plain young man, handsome enough for Pall, one of no education nor discourse, but of few words, and one altogether that, I think, will please me well enough.

1668-02-07 12:40 r I find these gentlemen to sit all day, and only eat a bit of bread at noon, and a glass of wine; and are resolved to go through their business with great severity and method.

1668-02-07 12:02   To the Commissioners of Accounts, and there presented my books, and was made to sit down, and used with much respect, otherwise than the other day, when I come to them as a criminal about the business of the prizes.

1668-02-06 21:10 r This evening coming home I did put my hand under the coats of Mercer and did touch her thigh, but then she did put by my hand and no hurt done, but talked and sang and was merry.

1668-02-06 20:44 r I did think that he and the linkman had contrived some roguery; but it proved only a mistake of the coachman; but it was a cunning place to have done us a mischief in, to drive us out of the road into the ruines, and there stop, while nobody could be called to help us.

1668-02-06 20:40 r Home round the town, not through the ruines; and it was pretty how the coachman by mistake drives us into the ruines from London-wall into Coleman Street, and would persuade me that I lived there.

1668-02-06 20:04 r At last I did find my wife staying for me in the entry; and with her was Betty Turner, Mercer, and Deb. So I got a coach, and a humour took us, and I carried them to Hercules Pillars, and there did give them a kind of a supper of about 7s., and very merry.

1668-02-06 18:27 r All the rest did, through the whole pit, blame the play as a silly, dull thing, though there was something very roguish and witty; but the design of the play, and end, mighty insipid.

1668-02-06 18:20 r Here was the Duke of Buckingham openly sat in the pit; I found him with my Lord Buckhurst, and Sidly, and Etherige, the poet; the last of whom I did hear find fault with the actors, that they were out of humour, and had not their parts perfect, and that Harris did do nothing.

1668-02-06 18:13 r The play being done, I into the pit to look my wife, but could not find her; and so staid going between the two doors and through the pit an hour and half, I think, after the play was done; the people staying there till the rain was over, and to talk with one another.

1668-02-06 15:32 r I at last, because my wife was there, made shift to get into the 18d. box, and there saw; but, Lord! how full was the house, and how silly the play, there being nothing in the world good in it, and few people pleased in it.

1668-02-06 14:10   My wife being gone before, I to the Duke of York’s playhouse; where a new play of Etherige’s, called “She Would if she Could;” and though I was there by two o’clock, there was 1000 people put back that could not have room in the pit.

1668-02-05 20:16 r But I have much reason to blame W. Hewer for his little assistance he gives me in my business, not being able to copy out a letter with sense or true spelling that makes me mad, and indeed he is in that regard of as little use to me as the boy, which troubles me.

1668-02-05 20:12   I to my chamber, where my wife and I had much talk of W. Hewer, she telling me that he is mightily concerned for my not being pleased with him, and is herself mightily concerned.

1668-02-05 15:04 r He tells me that an Act of Comprehension is likely to pass this Parliament, for admitting of all persuasions in religion to the public observation of their particular worship, but in certain places, and the persons therein concerned to be listed of this, or that Church.

1668-02-05 14:50   Mr. Moore mightily commends my Lord Hinchingbroke’s match and Lady, though he buys her 10,000l. dear, by the jointure and settlement his father makes her; and says that the Duke of York and Duchess of York did come to see them in bed together, on their wedding-night.

1668-02-05 13:40   I to the Ship Tavern, thereby to get a sight of the pretty mistress of the house, with whom I am not yet acquainted at all, and I do always find her scolding, and do believe she is an ill-natured devil, that I have no great desire to speak to her.

1668-02-05 12:15 r Though this be all, I do find so poor a spirit within me, that it makes me almost out of my wits, and puts me to so much pain, that I cannot think of anything, nor do anything but vex and fret, and imagine myself undone, so that I am ashamed of myself to myself.

1668-02-05 12:04 r I think that they can do me no hurt, at the worst, more than to make me refund, if it must be known, what profit I did make of my agreement with Captain Cocke.

1668-02-05 11:50 r I do perceive that they did lay most like a fault to me was, that I did buy goods upon my Lord Sandwich’s declaring that it was with the King’s allowance, and my believing it, without seeing the King’s allowance, which is a thing I will own, and doubt not to justify myself in.

1668-02-05 10:56 r They fell to enquire about the business of prize-goods, wherein I did answer them as well as I could, answer them in everything the just truth, keeping myself to that.

1668-02-05 10:33 r I to the Commissioners of Accounts, where I was forced to stay two hours before I was called in, and when come in did take an oath to declare the truth to what they should ask me, which is a great power.

1668-02-05 08:20   I to Captain Cocke’s, where he and I did discourse of our business that we are to go about to the Commissioners of Accounts about our prizes, and having resolved to conceal nothing but to confess the truth, the truth being likely to do us most good, we parted.

1668-02-05 00:20   Home, and there my wife and Deb. and I and Betty Turner, I employed in the putting new titles to my books, which we proceeded on till midnight, and then being weary and late to bed.

1668-02-04 16:32   I abroad by coach to Kate Joyce’s, where the jury did sit where they did before, about her husband’s death, and their verdict put off for fourteen days longer, at the suit of somebody, under pretence of the King; but it is only to get money out of her to compound the matter.

1668-02-04 11:58   To the office, where a full Board sat all the morning, busy among other things concerning a solemn letter we intend to write to the Duke of York about the state of the things of the Navy, for want of money, though I doubt it will be to little purpose.

1668-02-03 18:24 r But, however, there is nothing of crime can be laid to my charge, and the worst that can be is to refund my 500l. profit, and who can help it. So I resolve not to be troubled at it, though I fear I cannot bear it so.

1668-02-03 18:20   At the office met to my trouble with a warrant from the Commissioners of Accounts for my attending them and Cocke two days hence, which I apprehend by Captain Cocke’s being to go also, to be about the prizes.

1668-02-03 17:27   To the Duke of York’s house, to “The Tempest,” which we have often seen, but yet I was pleased again, it is so full of variety, and particularly this day I took pleasure to learn the tune of the seaman’s dance, which I have much desired to be perfect in.

1668-02-03 12:03   Up, and to the office, where with my clerks all the morning very busy about several things there wherein I was behindhand.

1668-02-02 17:11   After dinner, my head combed an hour, and then to work again, and at it, doing many things towards the setting my accounts and papers in order.

1668-02-02 13:20   To dinner, my wife coming down to me, and a very good dinner we had, of a powdered leg of pork and a loin of lamb roasted, and with much content she and I and Deb.

1668-02-02 11:49   All the morning setting my books in order in my presses, for the following year, their number being much increased since the last, so as I am fain to lay by several books to make room for better, being resolved to keep no more than just my presses will contain.

1668-02-01 22:05 r … the marrying of my sister; the building of a coach and stables against summer, and the setting many things in the Office right; and the drawing up a new form of Contract with the Victualler of the Navy, and several other things.

1668-02-01 22:03   To bed, my head full of business now on my hands: viz, of finishing my Tangier Accounts; of auditing my last year’s Accounts; of preparing answers to the Commissioners of Accounts; of drawing up several letters to the Duke of York and the Commissioners of the Treasury; …

1668-02-01 19:15   It being a fine day, we out to Islington, and there to the old house and eat cheese-cakes and drank and talked, and so home in the evening, the ways being mighty bad, so as we had no pleasure in being abroad at all almost, but only the variety of it.

1668-02-01 15:32   After dinner out with my wife, thinking to have gone to the Duke of York’s playhouse, but was, to my great content in the saving my vow, hindered by coming a little too late.

1668-02-01 13:20   At the Board some high words passed between Sir W. Pen and I, begun by me, and yielded to by him, I being in the right in finding fault with him for his neglect of duty.
