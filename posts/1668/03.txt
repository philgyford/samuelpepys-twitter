1668-03-31 21:50 r Going to bed Deb. undressed me, and there I did give her good advice and beso la, ella weeping still; and yo did take her, the first time in my life, sobra mi genu and did poner mi mano sub her jupes and toca su thigh, which did hazer me great pleasure; and so did no more.

1668-03-31 20:40   I called Deb. to take pen, ink, and paper and write down what things come into my head for my wife to do in order to her going into the country, and the girl, writing not so well as she would do, cried, and her mistress construed it to be sullenness, and so away angry with her.

1668-03-31 16:30   I took coach and away to Unthanke’s, and there took up my wife and Deb., and to the Park, where, being in a hackney, and they undressed, was ashamed to go into the tour, but went round the park, and so with pleasure home.

1668-03-31 12:50   To dinner, where uncle Thomas dined with me, as he do every quarter, and I paid him his pension; and also comes Mr. Hollier a little fuddled, and so did talk nothing but Latin, and laugh, that it was very good sport to see a sober man in such a humour.

1668-03-30 13:13 r All concluded that the bane of the Parliament hath been the leaving off the old custom of the places allowing wages to those that served them in Parliament, by which they chose men that understood their business, and they could expect an account from, which now they cannot.

1668-03-30 13:10   At dinner we had a great deal of good discourse about Parliament: their number being uncertain, and always at the will of the King to encrease, as he saw reason to erect a new borough.

1668-03-30 09:50 r Here I did see Mrs. Stewart’s picture as when a young maid, and now just done before her having the smallpox: and it would make a man weep to see what she was then, and what she is like to be, by people’s discourse, now.

1668-03-30 09:32   I met Harris, and Mr. Cooper, the painter: and to Mr. Cooper’s house, to see his work which is all in little but so excellent as, though I do think the colouring of the flesh to be a little forced, yet the painting is so extraordinary, as I do never expect to see the like again.

1668-03-29 15:13 r Harris do so commend my wife’s picture of Mr. Hales’s, that I shall have him draw Harris’s head; and he hath also persuaded me to have Cooper draw my wife’s, which, though it cost 30l., yet I will have done.

1668-03-29 14:20 r We sang, and Banister played on the theorbo, and on his flageolet, and I had very good discourse with him about music, so confirming my new notions about music that it puts me upon a resolution to go on and make a scheme and theory of music not yet ever made in the world.

1668-03-29 13:03   At home to dinner, whither comes and dines with me W. Howe, and by invitation Mr. Harris and Mr. Banister, most extraordinary company both, the latter for musique of all sorts, the former for everything.

1668-03-28 12:38 r And if we press there will be mutinies in the town; for the seamen are said already to have threatened the pulling down of the Treasury Office; and if they do once come to that, it will not be long before they come to ours.

1668-03-28 12:35   Our greatest business at the office today is our want of money for the setting forth of these ships that are to go out, and my people at dinner tell me that they do verily doubt that the want of men will be so great, as we must press.

1668-03-27 15:40   Called my wife at Unthanke’s, and so up and down to the Nursery, where they did not act, then to the New Cockpit, and there missed, and then to Hide Parke, where many coaches, but the dust so great, that it was troublesome.

1668-03-27 14:35   I to White Hall, but did nothing, but then to Westminster Hall and took a turn, and so to Mrs. Martin’s, and there did sit a little and talk and drink, and did hazer con her.

1668-03-27 13:10   My wife and I had a small squabble, but I first this day tried the effect of my silence and not provoking her when she is in an ill humour, and do find it very good, for it prevents its coming to that height on both sides which used to exceed what was fit between us.

1668-03-27 12:00   Mr. Pelling shows me the stone cut lately out of Sir Thomas Adams’ body, which is very large indeed, bigger I think than my fist, and weighs above twenty-five ounces and, which is very miraculous, he never in all his life had any fit of it, but lived to a great age without pain.

1668-03-27 00:30 r I having paid the reckoning, which come to almost 4l, we parted: my company and William Batelier, who was also with us, home in a coach, round by the Wall, where we met so many stops by the Watches, that it cost us much time and some trouble, and more money, to every Watch.

1668-03-26 23:35 r My wife extraordinary fine today, in her flower tabby suit, bought a year and more ago, before my mother’s death put her into mourning, and so not worn till this day: and everybody in love with it; and indeed she is very fine and handsome in it.

1668-03-26 23:20 r And mighty merry we were, with mighty great content in all my company, and I did, as I love to do, enjoy myself in my pleasure as being the height of what we take pains for and can hope for in this world, and therefore to be enjoyed while we are young and capable of these joys.

1668-03-26 20:30 r After much difficulty in getting of musique, we to dancing, and then to a supper of some French dishes, which yet did not please me, and then to dance and sing.

1668-03-26 18:20 r Thence, by agreement, we all of us to the Blue Balls, hard by, whither Mr. Pierce also goes with us, who met us at the play, and anon comes Manuel, and his wife, and Knepp, and Harris, who brings with him Mr. Banister, the great master of musique.

1668-03-26 17:30 r But the most of the mirth was sorry, poor stuffe, of eating of sack posset and slabbering themselves, and mirth fit for clownes; the prologue but poor, and the epilogue little in it but the extraordinariness of it, it being sung by Harris and another in the form of a ballet.

1668-03-26 17:10 r The play is a translation out of French, and the plot Spanish, but not anything extraordinary at all in it, though translated by Sir W. Davenant, and so I found the King and his company did think meanly of it, though there was here and there something pretty.

1668-03-26 13:45 r By and by the King come; and we sat just under him, so that I durst not turn my back all the play.

1668-03-26 12:56   I to the Duke of York’s house, to see the new play, called “The Man is the Master,” where the house was very full. But my wife and Deb. being there before, with Mrs. Pierce and Corbet and Betty Turner, they made me room; and there I sat, it costing me 8s. upon them in oranges.

1668-03-26 11:10   My Lord Brouncker sent to Somersett House to hear how the Duchess of Richmond do; she is pretty well, but mighty full of the smallpox, by which all do conclude she will be wholly spoiled, which is the greatest instance of the uncertainty of beauty that could be in this age.

1668-03-25 20:30   With my wife and Deb. by coach to Islington, to the old house, and there eat and drank till it was almost night, and then home, being in fear of meeting the ’prentices, who are many of them yet, they say, abroad in the fields, but we got well home.

1668-03-25 17:20   With my wife to the King’s playhouse to see “The Storme,” which we did, but without much pleasure, it being but a mean play compared with “The Tempest,” at the Duke of York’s house, though Knepp did act her part of grief very well.

1668-03-25 12:14 r …but remembering that I was to go out with my wife this afternoon, I only did hazer her para tocar my prick con her hand, which did hazer me hazer; and so to a milliner, and there did give her eight pair of gloves, and so dismissed her, and so I home and to dinner.

1668-03-25 12:10   In Seething Lane met young Mrs. Daniel, and I stopt, and she had been at my house, but found nobody within, and tells me that she drew me for her Valentine this year, so I took her into the coach, and was going to the other end of the town, thinking to have taken her abroad…

1668-03-25 09:55 r Some of them have the last night had a word among them, and it was “Reformation and Reducement.” This do make the courtiers ill at ease to see this spirit among people, though they think this matter will not come to much: but it speaks people’s minds.

1668-03-25 09:40 r Some blood hath been spilt, but a great many houses pulled down; and, among others, the Duke of York was merry at that of Damaris Page’s, the great bawd of the seamen; and the Duke of York complained merrily that he hath lost two tenants, by their houses being pulled down.

1668-03-25 09:30   The Duke of York and all with him this morning were full of the talk of the ’prentices, who are not yet down, though the militia of the town have been in arms all this night; and the ’prentices have made fools of them, sometimes by running from them and flinging stones at them.

1668-03-24 21:15   To my chamber, to prick out my song, “It is Decreed,” intending to have it ready to give Mr. Harris when we meet, for him to sing, believing that he will do it more right than a woman that sings better, unless it were Knepp, which I cannot have opportunity to teach it to.

1668-03-24 15:30 r Sir Fr. Hollis did call for his bagpipes, which, with pipes of ebony, tipt with silver, he did play beyond anything of that kind that ever I heard in my life; and with great pains he must have obtained it, but with pains that the instrument do not deserve at all.

1668-03-24 14:50   I met Sir Fr. Hollis, who do still tell me that, above all things in the world, he wishes he had my tongue in his mouth, meaning since my speech in Parliament.

1668-03-24 10:24 r We heard a justice of the Peace say to the King, that he had been endeavouring to suppress this tumult, but could not; and that, imprisoning some in the new prison at Clerkenwell, the rest did come and break open the prison and release them.

1668-03-24 09:40 r So Creed and I to Lincolne’s Inn-fields, thinking to have gone into the fields to have seen the ’prentices; but here we found these fields full of soldiers all in a body, and my Lord Craven commanding of them, and riding up and down to give orders, like a madman.

1668-03-24 09:20 r Lord! to see the apprehensions which this did give to all people at Court, that presently order was given for all the soldiers, horse and foot, to be in armes! and forthwith alarmes were beat by drum and trumpet through Westminster, as if the French were coming into the town!

1668-03-24 09:10   To White Hall, where great talk of the tumult at the other end of the town, about Moore-fields, among the ’prentices, taking the liberty of these holydays to pull down bawdy-houses.

1668-03-24 07:50   There comes to me Mr. Shish, to desire my appearing for him to succeed Mr. Christopher Pett, lately dead, in his place of Master-Shipwright of Deptford and Woolwich, which I do resolve to promote what I can.

1668-03-23 21:20 r And so, having a violin and theorbo, did fall to dance, here being also Mrs. Floyd come hither, and by and by Mr. Harris. But there being so few of us that could dance, and my wife not being very well, we had not much pleasure in the dancing.

1668-03-23 18:40 r At Barne-Elms we walked round, and then to the barge again, and had much merry talk, and good singing; and come before it was dark to the New Exchange stairs, and there landed, and walked up to Mrs. Pierces, where we sat awhile, and then up to their dining-room.

1668-03-23 16:32 r After sitting long at dinner, I had a barge ready at Tower-wharfe, and so we went up as high as Barne-Elms, a fine day, and all the way sang; and Mrs. Manuel sings very finely, and is a mighty discreet, sober-carriaged woman, that both my wife and I are mightily taken with her.

1668-03-23 13:40 r I had an extraordinary good dinner, and the better because dressed by my own servants, and were mighty merry; and here was Mr. Pelling by chance come and dined with me.

1668-03-23 12:05   At noon come Mr. Pierce and she, and Mrs. Manuel, the Jew’s wife, and Mrs. Corbet, and Mrs. Pierces boy and girl. But we are defeated of Knepp, by her being forced to act today, and also of Harris, which did trouble me, they being my chief guests.

1668-03-23 10:03   To Bishopsgate Streete, thinking to have found a Harpsicon-maker that used to live there before the fire, but he is gone, and I have a mind to have a little Harpsicon made me to confirm and help me in my music notions, which my head is now-a-days full of.

1668-03-23 08:50   Up, and after discoursing with my wife about many things touching this day’s dinner, I abroad, and first to the taverne to pay what I owe there, but missed of seeing the mistress of the house, and there bespoke wine for dinner.

1668-03-22 22:10   I to my closet to make a few more experiments of my notions in musique, and so then my wife and I to walk in the garden, and then home to supper and to bed.

1668-03-22 13:03 r For it will be best for her to marry, I think, as soon as she can — at least, to be rid of this house; for the trade will not agree with a young widow, that is a little handsome, at least ordinary people think her so.

1668-03-22 12:58 r But that there is another, a tobacconist, one Holinshed, whom she speaks well of, to be a plain, sober man, and in good condition, that offers her very well, and submits to me my examining and inquiring after it, if I see good, which I do like of it.

1668-03-22 12:53 r She assures me she neither do nor will incline to the doing anything towards marriage, without my advice, and did tell me that she had many offers, and that Harman and his friends would fain have her; but he is poor, and hath poor friends, and so it will not be advisable.

1668-03-22 12:50   I home to dinner, where Kate Joyce was, as I invited her, and had a good dinner, only she and us; and after dinner she and I alone to talk about her business, as I designed; and I find her very discreet.

1668-03-22 10:00   Brisband and I to the Queen’s chapel, and there did hear the Italians sing; and indeed their music did appear most admirable to me, beyond anything of ours: I was never so well satisfied in my life with it.

1668-03-21 15:30   Abroad to do several things, and pay what little scores I had, and among others to Mrs. Martin’s, and there did give 20s. to Mrs. Cragg, her landlady, who was my Valentine in the house, as well as Doll Lane. Here yo did hazer la cosa with Mrs. Martin backward.

1668-03-20 21:50   Home, and for saving my eyes at my chamber all the evening pricking down some things, and trying some conclusions upon my viall, in order to the inventing a better theory of musique than hath yet been abroad; and I think verily I shall do it.

1668-03-20 16:16   I by coach to Kate Joyce’s, being desirous and in pain to speak with her about the business that I received a letter yesterday, but had no opportunity of speaking with her about it, company being with her, so I only invited her to come and dine with me.

1668-03-20 09:10   To my Office, where we had a meeting extraordinary to consider the sum of money fit to be demanded ready money, to enable us to set out 27 ships, everybody being now in pain for a fleet, and everybody endeavouring to excuse themselves for the not setting out of one.

1668-03-19 21:57   To the office, very busy, and then to ease my eyes I took my wife out and Deb. to the ’Change, and bought them some things, and so home again and to the office, ended my letters, and so home to read a little more in last night’s book, with much sport, it being a foolish book.

1668-03-19 15:58 r I did answer the letter with thanks and good liking, and am resolved to take the advice he gives me, and go see her, and find out what I can: but if she will ruin herself, I cannot help it, though I should be troubled for it.

1668-03-19 15:42   I was surprized with a letter without a name to it, very well writ, giving me notice of my cozen Kate Joyce’s being likely to ruin herself by marriage, and by ill reports abroad of her, and I do fear that this keeping of an inne may spoil her, being a young and comely woman.

1668-03-19 09:40   Walked all along Thames Street, which I have not done since it was burned, as far as Billingsgate; and there do see a brave street likely to be, many brave houses being built, and of them a great many by Mr. Jaggard; but the raising of the street will make it mighty fine.

1668-03-18 22:03   I to bed, my eyes being very bad; and I know not how in the world to abstain from reading.

1668-03-18 20:18 r Betty Turner sent my wife the book to read, and it being a fair print, to ease my eyes, which would be reading, I read that.

1668-03-18 20:15   Home, and there, in favour to my eyes, stayed at home, reading the ridiculous History of my Lord Newcastle, wrote by his wife, which shews her to be a mad, conceited, ridiculous woman, and he an asse to suffer her to write what she writes to him, and of him.

1668-03-18 16:22   Sir W. Coventry, W. Pen and I, by hackney-coach to take a little ayre in Hyde Parke, the first time I have been there this year; and we did meet many coaches going and coming, it being mighty pleasant weather.

1668-03-18 15:45 r The King and the Duke of York talking of the Committee of Miscarriages, how this entering of men before the ships could be ready would be reckoned a miscarriage; “Why,” says the King, “it is then but Mr. Pepys making of another speech to them;” which made the Lords look upon me.

1668-03-18 15:30 r I did speak to the justifying what we had done, even to the angering of Duncomb and Clifford, which I was vexed at, but I did set the Office right and went away with the victory, my Lord Keeper saying that he would not advise the Council to order us to sign no more certificates.

1668-03-18 15:05   To White Hall, where we attended the Council to discourse about the fitness of entering of men presently for the manning of the fleet, before one ship is in condition to receive them. W. Coventry did argue against it: I was wholly silent because I saw the King was willing to it.

1668-03-18 13:12   Away by coach to my bookseller’s, and to several places to pay my debts, and to Ducke Lane, and there bought Montaigne’s Essays, in English, and so away home to dinner.

1668-03-18 11:10   I met Doll Lane at the Dog tavern, and there yo did hazer what I did desire with her and did it backward, not having convenience to do it the other way. I did give her as being my valentine 20s. to buy what ella would.

1668-03-18 08:04   Cozen Roger do continue of the mind that there is no other way of saving this nation but by dissolving this Parliament and calling another; but there are so many about the King that will not be able to stand, if a new Parliament come, that they will not persuade the King to it.

1668-03-17 20:10   The House, I hear, have this day concluded upon raising 100,000l. of the 300,000l. by wine, and the rest by a poll, and have resolved to excuse the Church, in expectation that they will do the more of themselves at this juncture.

1668-03-17 16:30   I stopped at the ’Change, and there bought several things for my wife, and so to my bookseller’s, and there looked for Montaigne’s Essays, which I heard by my Lord Arlington and Lord Blaney so much commended, and intend to buy it, but did not now.

1668-03-17 14:12 r Above all, he do curse my Lord of Bristoll, saying the worst news that the Devil could ever bring us was this Lord’s coming to prayers the other day in the House of Lords, by which he is coming about again from being a Papist, which will undo this nation.

1668-03-17 14:04   I fell in talk with Mr. Ball, who, being an old cavalier, do swear and curse at the present state of things, that we should be brought to this, that we must be undone and cannot be saved.

1668-03-16 22:14   After a little at the office I home, and there spent the evening with my wife talking and singing, and so to bed with my mind pretty well at ease.

1668-03-16 19:30   W. Pen and Sir R. Ford and I met at the first’s house to talk of our prize that is now at last come safe over from Holland, by which I hope to receive some if not all the benefit of my bargain with W. Batten for my share in it.

1668-03-16 13:50   I with Sir W. Pen home, and there to dinner, where I find, by Willet’s crying, that her mistress had been angry with her: but I would take no notice of it.

1668-03-16 12:04   In the Hall, did walk all the morning, talking with one or other, expecting to have our business in the House; but did now a third time wait to no purpose, they being all this morning upon the business of Barker’s petition about the making void the Act of Settlement in Ireland.

1668-03-15 19:42 r Even after I knew that it was not board, but only the picture of a board, I could not remove my fancy.

1668-03-15 19:30   Mightily pleased with a picture that W. Hewer brought hither of several things painted upon a deal board, which board is so well painted that I never was so well pleased with any picture, and so troubled that so good pictures should be painted upon a piece of bad deale.

1668-03-15 14:20 r Good discourse of Spain, Mr. Godolphin being there; particularly of the removal of the bodies of all the dead Kings of Spain that could be got together, and brought to the Pantheon at the Escuriall, when it was finished, and there placed before the altar, there to lie for ever.

1668-03-15 13:55   Sir Thomas Clifford, the Comptroller, took me with him to dinner to his lodgings, where my Lord Arlington and a great deal of good and great company; where I very civilly used by them, and had a most excellent dinner.

1668-03-15 08:48   Up and walked, it being fine dry weather, to Sir W. Coventry’s, overtaking my boy Ely (that was), and he walked with me, being grown a man, and I think a sober fellow.

1668-03-14 22:03   My wife and I abroad by coach into Moorefields, only for a little ayre, and so home again, staying nowhere, and then up to her chamber, there to talk with pleasure of this day’s passages, and so to bed.

1668-03-14 15:28 r My Lady Hinchingbroke I find a very sweet-natured and well-disposed lady, a lover of books and pictures, and of good understanding.

1668-03-14 14:57 r Most of our discourse was of my Lord Sandwich and his family, as being all of us of the family; and with extraordinary pleasure all the afternoon, thus together eating and looking over my closet.

1668-03-14 14:20 r And there, among other things, my Lord had Sir Samuel Morland’s late invention for casting up of sums of 0l. 0s. 0d.; which is very pretty, but not very useful.

1668-03-14 13:55   Anon comes my company, viz, my Lord Hinchingbroke and his lady, Sir Philip Carteret and his lady, Godolphin and my cozen Roger, and Creed: and mighty merry; and by and by to dinner, which was very good and plentifull.

1668-03-14 10:20   After having spoke with Mr. Godolphin and cozen Roger, I away home, and there do find everything in mighty good order, only my wife not dressed, which troubles me.

1668-03-14 08:46   To Westminster Hall, and there met my Lord Brouncker, who tells me that our business is put off, and so I was mighty glad that I was eased of my attendance here, and of any occasion that might put me out of humour, as it is likely if we had been called before the Parliament.

1668-03-14 07:00   Up very betimes, and with Jane to Levett’s, there to conclude upon our dinner; and thence to the pewterer’s, to buy a pewter sesterne, which I have ever hitherto been without, and so up and down upon several occasions to set matters in order.

1668-03-13 19:55 r We to Philips’s, and his man directed us to Mr. Levett’s, who could not come, and he sent to two more, and they could not; so that, at last, Levett as a great kindness did resolve he would leave his business and come himself, which set me in great ease in my mind.

1668-03-13 18:15 r But after we had found him, he could not come, nor was Mr. Gentleman in town, whom next I would have had, nor would Mrs. Stone let her man Lewis come, whom this man recommended to me; so that I was at a mighty loss what in the world to do for a cooke, Philips being out of town.

1668-03-13 17:52 r I to Mrs. Turner, and did get her to go along with me to the French pewterer’s, and there did buy some new pewter against tomorrow; and thence to White Hall, to have got a cook of her acquaintance, the best in England, as she says.

1668-03-13 16:42 r I find my wife upon the bed not over well, her breast being broke out with heat, which troubles her, but I hope it will be for her good.

1668-03-13 16:35 r Home, and there find one laying of my napkins against tomorrow in figures of all sorts, which is mighty pretty; and, it seems, it is his trade, and he gets much money by it; which is mighty pretty, and a trade I could not have thought of.

1668-03-13 15:57 r My Lady Hinchingbroke I cannot say is a beauty, nor ugly; but is altogether a comely lady enough, and seems very good-humoured, and I mighty glad of the occasion of seeing her before tomorrow.

1668-03-13 15:55   I to my Lord Crew’s, there to invite Sir Thomas Crew; and there met with my Lord Hinchingbroke and his lady, the first time I spoke to her. I saluted her; and she mighty civil and; with my Lady Jemimah, do all resolve to be very merry tomorrow at my house.

1668-03-13 14:50   To White Hall to the Duke of York, and there did our usual business, complaining of our standing still in every-respect for want of money, but no remedy propounded, but so I must still be.

1668-03-13 13:40   I to the Hall, where my Lord Brouncker and the rest waiting and not called for, and all of us to Chatelin’s, the French house in Covent Garden, and there had a damned base dinner, which did not please us at all, so that I am not fond of this house at all but do choose the Beare.

1668-03-13 07:15   Up betimes to my office, where to fit myself for attending the Parliament again, not to make any more speech, which, while my fame is good, I will avoid, for fear of losing it; but only to answer to what objections will be made against us.

1668-03-12 20:12   Home to supper, and to talk with Mr. Pelling, who tells me what a fame I have in the City for my late performance; and upon the whole I bless God for it. I think I have, if I can keep it, done myself a great deal of repute.

1668-03-12 17:12 r Here I heard Sir Robert Southwell give an account of some things committed to him by the Society at his going to Portugall, which he did deliver in a mighty handsome manner.

1668-03-12 16:40 r Here I saw a great trial of the goodness of a burning glass, made of a new figure, not spherical, that did burn a glove of my Lord Brouncker’s from the heat of a very little fire, which a burning glass of the old form, or much bigger, could not do, which was mighty pretty.

1668-03-12 15:30   I took my wife up and left her at the ’Change while I to Gresham College, there to shew myself; and was there greeted by Dr. Wilkins, Whistler, and others, as the patron of the Navy Office, and one that got great fame by my late speech to the Parliament.

1668-03-11 17:06 r This man knew me, which I would have willingly avoided, so much pride I had, he being a man of mighty height and authority in his time, but now signifies nothing.

1668-03-11 17:04 r I carried cozen Roger as far as the Strand, where, spying out of the coach Colonel Charles George Cocke, formerly a very great man, and my father’s customer, whom I have carried clothes to, but now walks like a poor sorry sneake, he stopped, and I ’light to him.

1668-03-11 15:58   I met with my cozen Roger Pepys, who hath been told of my performance before the House and is mighty proud of it, and Captain Cocke met me and told me that the Speaker says he never heard such a defence made; and that the Sollicitor-Generall do commend me even to envy.

1668-03-11 14:04 r A very fine house, and a man that lives in great fashion, with all things in a most extraordinary manner noble and rich about him, and eats in the French fashion all; and nobly served with his servants, and very civilly; that I was mighty pleased with it: and good discourse.

1668-03-11 12:50   To Westminster; and there walked, till by and by comes Sir W. Coventry, and with him Mr. Chichly and Mr. Andrew Newport, I to dinner with them to Mr. Chichly’s, in Queene Street, in Covent Garden.

1668-03-11 08:25   Up, and betimes to the office, where busy till 8 o’clock, and then went forth, and meeting Mr. Colvill, I walked with him to his building, where he is building a fine house, where he formerly lived, in Lumbard Street: and it will be a very fine street.

1668-03-10 22:54 r But I was mightily pleased with his singing; for the rogue hath a very good eare, and a good voice. Here he stayed till he was almost drunk, and then away at about ten at night, and then all broke up, and I to bed.

1668-03-10 20:40   I up to supper, where I find W. Joyce and Harman come to see us, and there was also Mrs. Mercer and her two daughters, and here we were as merry as that fellow Joyce could make us with his mad talking, after the old wont, which tired me.

1668-03-10 17:42   By coach to Lincoln’s Inn Fields; but my Lady was not come in, and so I am at a great loss whether she and her brother Hinchingbroke and sister will dine with me to-morrow or no, which vexes me.

1668-03-10 16:04   With Sir D. Gawden to Westminster Hall, thinking to have attended the Committee about the Victualling business, but they did not meet, but here we met Sir R. Brookes, who do mightily cry up my speech the other day, saying my fellow-officers are obliged to me, as indeed they are.

1668-03-10 13:50   After dinner comes Kate Joyce, who tells me she is putting off her house, which I am glad of, but it was pleasant that she come on purpose to me about getting a ticket paid, and in her way hither lost her ticket, so that she is at a great loss what to do.

1668-03-09 22:20   Home late to supper and to bed, being eased of a great many thoughts, and yet have a great many more to remove as fast as I can, my mind being burdened with them, having been so much employed upon the public business of the office in their defence before the Parliament of late.

1668-03-09 09:40 r I also met Colvill, the goldsmith, who tells me how the world upon the ’Change talks of me; and how several Parliamentmen, viz, Boscawen and Major Walden, do say how bravely I did speak, and that the House was ready to have given me thanks for it; but that, I think, is a vanity.

1668-03-09 09:02   With Sir W. Warren, who come to speak with me, by coach to White Hall, and there met Lord Brouncker: and he and I to the Commissioners of the Treasury, where I find them mighty kind to me, more, I think, than was wont.

1668-03-08 13:59 r Though, when all is done, he is a shirke, who owns his owing me 10l. for his lady two or three years ago, and yet cannot provide to pay me.

1668-03-08 13:56 r I up with her husband, Sir Philip Carteret, to his closet, where, beyond expectation, I do find many pretty things, wherein he appears to be ingenious, such as in painting, and drawing, and making of watches, and such kind of things, above my expectation.

1668-03-08 13:03 r Here my Lady Jem. do promise to come, and bring my Lord Hinchingbroke and his lady some day this week, to dinner to me, which I am glad of.

1668-03-08 12:30   I to dinner with Sir G. Carteret to Lincoln’s Inn Fields, where I find mighty deal of company — a solemn day for some of his and her friends, and dine in the great dining-room above stairs, where Sir G. Carteret himself, and I, and his son, at a little table by.

1668-03-08 09:10   Sir J. Robinson, Lieutenant of the Tower, did call me with his coach, and carried me to White Hall, where met with very many people still that did congratulate my speech the other day in the House of Commons, and I find all the world almost rings of it.

1668-03-07 22:15   To the office, where I wrote what I had to write, and among others to my father to congratulate my sister’s marriage, and so home to supper a little and then to bed.

1668-03-07 17:20 r A very silly play, only great variety of dances, and those most excellently done, especially one part by one Hanes, only lately come thither from the Nursery, an understanding fellow, but yet, they say, hath spent 1000l. a-year before he come thither.

1668-03-07 14:04   Home to dinner, where Mercer with us, and after dinner she, my wife, Deb., and I, to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Spanish Gipsys,” the second time of acting, and the first that I saw it.

1668-03-06 22:07 r With the Lieutenant of the Tower, in his coach home; and there, with great pleasure, with my wife, talking and playing at cards a little — she, and I, and W. Hewer, and Deb., and so, after a little supper, I to bed.

1668-03-06 13:27 r My Lord Gerard, who never knew me before nor spoke to me, desires his being better acquainted with me; and that, at table where he was, he never heard so much said of any man as of me, in his whole life.

1668-03-06 11:42 r Mr. Vaughan did protest that he had sat 26 years in Parliament and never heard such a speech there before: for which the Lord God make me thankful! and that I may make use of it not to pride and vainglory, but that, now I have this esteem, I may do nothing that may lessen it!

1668-03-06 11:00 r Every body that saw me come to me with such eulogys as cannot be expressed. I met Mr. G. Montagu who kissed me and told me that he had often heretofore kissed my hands but now he would kiss my lips: protesting that I was another Cicero and said all the world said the same of me.

1668-03-06 10:08 r My Lord Barkeley did cry me up for what they had heard of it; and others, Parliament-men there, about the King, did say that they never heard such a speech in their lives delivered in that manner.

1668-03-06 09:32 r And, by and by, overtaking the King, the King and Duke of York come to me both; and he said, “Mr. Pepys, I am very glad of your success yesterday;” and fell to talk of my well speaking.

1668-03-06 09:10 r I to the Duke of York’s lodgings, and find him going to the Park, it being a very fine morning, and I after him; and he told me, with great satisfaction, that I had converted a great many yesterday, and did, with great praise of me, go on with the discourse with me.

1668-03-06 08:15 r He said that his brother admires me; and another gentleman said that I could not get less than 1000l. a-year if I would put on a gown and plead at the Chancery-bar; but, what pleases me most, the Sollicitor-Generall did protest that I spoke the best of any man in England.

1668-03-06 07:50   With Sir D. Gawden to Sir W. Coventry’s chamber: where the first word he said to me was, “Good-morrow, Mr. Pepys, that must be Speaker of the Parliament-house” and did protest I had got honour for ever in Parliament.

1668-03-05 21:00 r Home with W. Pen, and there to my wife, whom W. Hewer had told of my success, and she overjoyed, and I also as to my particular; and, after talking awhile, I betimes to bed, having had no quiet rest a good while.

1668-03-05 16:10 r However, it is plain we have got great ground; and everybody says I have got the most honour that any could have had opportunity of getting; and so with our hearts mightily overjoyed at this success, we all to dinner to Lord Brouncker’s.

1668-03-05 15:55 r But my speech, being so long, many had gone out to dinner and come in again half drunk; and then there are two or three that are professed enemies to us and every body else, these did rise up and speak against the coming to a vote now, the House not being full.

1668-03-05 15:45 r We were called in again by and by to answer only one question, touching our paying tickets to ticket-mongers; and so out; and we were in hopes to have had a vote this day in our favour, and so the generality of the House was.

1668-03-05 15:32 r All my Fellow-Officers, and all the world that was within hearing, did congratulate me, and cry up my speech as the best thing they ever heard; and my Fellow-Officers overjoyed in it.

1668-03-05 15:10 r I continued at it without any hesitation or losse, but with full scope, and all my reason free about me, as if it had been at my own table, from that time till past three in the afternoon; and so ended, without any interruption from the Speaker; but we withdrew.

1668-03-05 12:50 r I perceive the whole House was full, and full of expectation of our defence what it would be, and with great prejudice. After the Speaker had told us the dissatisfaction of the House, and read the Report of the Committee, I began our defence most acceptably and smoothly.

1668-03-05 11:24 r So we all up to the lobby; and between eleven and twelve o’clock, were called in, with the mace before us, into the House, where a mighty full House; and we stood at the bar, namely, Brouncker, Sir J. Minnes, Sir T. Harvey, and myself, W. Pen being in the House, as a Member.

1668-03-05 10:32 r I full of thoughts and trouble touching the issue of this day; and, to comfort myself, did go to the Dog and drink half-a-pint of mulled sack, and in the Hall did drink a dram of brandy; and with the warmth of this did find myself in better order as to courage, truly.

1668-03-05 09:00 r I did go down to the Old Swan, and there by boat, with T. Hater and W. Hewer with me, to Westminster, where I found myself come time enough, and my brethren all ready.

1668-03-05 07:30 r So with great trouble, but yet with some ease, from this discourse with my wife, I up, and to my Office, whither come my clerks, and so I did huddle the best I could some more notes for my discourse today.

1668-03-05 06:30 r With these thoughts I lay troubling myself, restless, and at last getting my wife to talk to me to comfort me, which she at last did, and made me resolve to quit my hands of this Office, and endure the trouble of it no longer than till I can clear myself of it.

1668-03-05 04:10 r Slept about three hours, but then waked, and never in so much trouble in all my life of mind, thinking of the task I have upon me, and upon what dissatisfactory grounds, and what the issue of it may be to me.

1668-03-04 22:10 r Quite weary, and dull, and vexed, I could go no further, but resolved to leave the rest to tomorrow morning, and so in full discontent and weariness did give over and went home, without supper vexed and sickish to bed.

1668-03-04 20:23 r Only with room for a little dinner, we very busy all the day till night that the officers met for me to give them the heads of what I intended to say, which I did with great discontent to see them all rely on me that have no reason at all to trouble myself about it.

1668-03-04 09:23   It being a cold wet day, I home with Sir J. Minnes in his coach, and called by the way at my bookseller’s and took home with me Kercher’s Musurgia — very well bound, but I had no comfort to look upon them, but as soon as I come home fell to my work at the office.

1668-03-03 23:57   I home and there to my chamber with Mr. Gibson, and late up till midnight preparing more things against our defence to my content, though vexed that all this trouble should be on me.

1668-03-03 15:10   Down by water to Deptford, where the King, Queene, and Court are to see launched the new ship built by Mr. Shish, called “The Charles.” God send her better luck than the former!

1668-03-03 08:20   Up betimes to work again, where to our great business of this answer to the Parliament; where to my great vexation I find my Lord Brouncker prepared only to excuse himself, while I, that have least reason to trouble myself, am preparing with great pains to defend them all.

1668-03-03 01:50   Home, and there I settle to business, and with my people preparing my great answer to the Parliament for the office about tickets till past 1 a o’clock at night, and then home to supper and to bed, keeping Mr. Gibson with me.

1668-03-02 17:13   With my wife and the girl to the King’s house to see the “Virgin Martyr” again, which do please me, but above all the musique at the coming down of the angel, which at this hearing the second time, do still commend me as nothing ever did, and the other music is nothing to it.

1668-03-02 10:44   W. Hewer tells me that the Officers of the Navy shall be all turned out, but honest Sir John Minnes, who, God knows, is fitter to have been turned out himself than any of us, doing the King more hurt by his dotage and folly than all the rest can do by their knavery.

1668-03-01 22:00   So without supper to bed, my eyes being also a little overwrought of late that I could not stay up to read.

1668-03-01 16:03 r To Mrs. Martin’s, and with great difficulty, company being there, did get an opportunity to hazer what I would con her, and here I was mightily taken with a starling which she hath, that was the King’s, which do whistle and talk the best that ever I heard anything in my life.

1668-03-01 14:33   To St. Margaret’s church, thinking to have seen Betty Michell, but she was not there, but met her father and mother and with them to her father’s house, where I never was before, but was mighty much made of, with some good strong waters, which they have from their son Michell.

1668-03-01 11:42   In lieu of a coach this year, I have got my wife to be contented with her closet being made up this summer, and going into the country for a month or two, to my father’s, and there Mercer and Deb. and Jane shall go with her, which I the rather do for the entertaining my wife.

1668-03-01 10:20 r We did here do the like about the complaint of want of victuals in the fleet in the year 1666, which will lie upon me to defend also. So that my head is full of care and weariness in my employment.

1668-03-01 08:50   Up very betimes, and by coach to Sir W. Coventry’s; and there, carrying with me all papers, did run over our whole defence in the business of tickets, in order to the answering the House; and I do think, unless they be set without reason to ruin us, we shall make a good defence.
