1660-12-31 22:20   Home and to bed.

1660-12-31 21:25 r Strange how the fellow, without asking, did tell me all what he was, and how he had ran away from his father and come into England to serve the King, and now going back again.

1660-12-31 21:20   At Whitehall inquiring for a coach, there was a Frenchman with one eye that was going my way, so he and I hired the coach between us and he set me down in Fenchurch Street.

1660-12-31 20:50   My boy taking a cat home with him from my Lord’s, which Sarah had given him for my wife, we being much troubled with mice.

1660-12-31 18:00   I went to my Lord’s, where I found him private at cards with my Lord Lauderdale and some persons of honour. So Mr. Shepley and I over to Harper’s, and there drank a pot or two, and so parted.

1660-12-31 17:10   In Paul’s Church-yard I bought the play of “Henry the Fourth,” and so went to the new Theatre and saw it acted; but my expectation being too great, it did not please me, as otherwise I believe it would; and my having a book, I believe did spoil it a little.


1660-12-30 16:10   I to the Abby and walked there, seeing the great confusion of people that come there to hear the organs.

1660-12-30 15:20 r My Lord dined abroad and my Lady in her chamber, so Mr. Hetly, Child and I dined together, and after dinner Mr. Child and I spent some time at the lute, and so promising to prick me some lessons to my theorbo he went away to see Henry Laws, who lies very sick.

1660-12-30 12:40   Lay long in bed, and being up, I went with Will to my Lord’s, calling in at many churches in my way. There I found Mr. Shepley, in his Venetian cap, taking physique in his chamber, and with him I sat till dinner.


1660-12-29 21:10   I home with my father, he telling me what bad wives both my cozen Joyces make to their husbands, which I much wondered at.

1660-12-29 15:40   To Alderman Backwell’s and took a brave state-plate and cupp in lieu of the candlesticks that I had the other day and carried them by coach to my Lord’s and left them there.

1660-12-29 13:20   With Captain Robert Blake I went to Sir W. Pen, who offering me a barrel of oysters I took them both home to my house (having by chance a good piece of roast beef at the fire for dinner), and there they dined with me.


1660-12-28 22:10   At my lute, with great pleasure, and so to bed with great content.

1660-12-28 12:10   Office day. There all the morning.

1660-12-28 07:20 r I was pretty well, only got cold, and so had pain in pissing, as I used to have.

1660-12-28 03:10   I was very ill — I think with eating and drinking too much — and so I was forced to call the maid, who pleased my wife and I in her running up and down so innocently in her smock, and vomited in the bason, and so to sleep.


1660-12-27 22:10   Home and with my wife to Sir W. Batten’s to dinner, where much and good company. My wife not very well went home, I staid late there seeing them play at cards, and so home to bed.

1660-12-27 16:30   There came in a strange lord to Sir William Batten’s by a mistake and enters discourse with him, so that we could not be rid of him till Sir Arn. Breames and Mr. Bens and Sir W. Pen fell a-drinking to him till he was drunk, and so sent him away.

1660-12-27 10:40 r I staid in the garden talking much with my Lord, who do show me much of his love and do communicate his mind in most things to me, which is my great content.

1660-12-27 09:10   To Alderman Backwell’s, where I found the candlesticks done, and went along with him in his coach to my Lord’s and left the candlesticks with Mr. Shepley.


1660-12-26 14:20   I returned to White Hall by water, and dined with my Lady Sandwich, who at table did tell me how much fault was laid upon Dr. Frazer and the rest of the Doctors, for the death of the Princess!

1660-12-26 11:00   To the office (being soundly washed going through the bridge) to Sir Wm. Batten and Pen (the last of whom took physic to-day), and so I went up to his chamber.

1660-12-26 00:00   I, before and after supper, to my lute and Fuller’s History, at which I staid all alone in my chamber, and so to bed.


1660-12-25 15:50   To church again, my wife and I, where we had a dull sermon of a stranger, which made me sleep.

1660-12-25 14:00   Home to dinner, where my wife and I and my brother Tom (who this morning came to see my wife’s new mantle put on, which do please me very well), to a good shoulder of mutton and a chicken.

1660-12-25 09:10   Very much pleased to see my house once more clear of workmen and to be clean, and indeed it is so, far better than it was that I do not repent of my trouble that I have been at.


1660-12-24 22:00   Home, and with the painters, making an end of my house and the arch before my door, and so this night I was rid of them and all other work, and my house was made ready against tomorrow being Christmas day.

1660-12-24 19:20   This day the Princess Royal died at Whitehall.

1660-12-24 14:20 r I went and chose a payre of candlesticks to be made ready for me at Alderman Backwell’s.

1660-12-24 10:10   To the office and Commissioner Pett (who seldom comes there) told me that he had lately presented a piece of plate (being a couple of flaggons) to Mr. Coventry, but he did not receive them, which also put me upon doing the same too.


1660-12-23 14:05   Home and found my wife and maid with much ado had made shift to spit a great turkey sent me this week from Charles Carter, my old colleague, now minister in Huntingdonshire, but not at all roasted, and so I was fain to stay till two o’clock.

1660-12-23 11:30   To Church, where our pew all covered with rosemary and baize. A stranger made a dull sermon.


1660-12-22 22:00 r I home (found my house clear of the workmen and their work ended), my head troubled with wine, and I very merry went to bed.

1660-12-22 21:40 r At last Sir W. Pen and I home together, he so overcome with wine that he could hardly go; I was forced to lead him through the streets and he was in a very merry and kind mood.

1660-12-22 20:10   I went to the Sun tavern; on Fish Street hill, to a dinner of Captn. Teddimans, where was my Lord Inchiquin, Sir W. Pen, Captn. Cuttance, and one Mr. Lawrence, and other good company, where we had a very fine dinner, good musique, and a great deal of wine.

1660-12-22 11:50   All the morning with my painters, who will make an end of all this day I hope.


1660-12-21 20:10 r He tells me that my aunt at Brampton has voided a great stone (the first time that ever I heard she was troubled therewith) and cannot possibly live long, that my uncle is pretty well, but full of pain still.

1660-12-21 19:40   I walked through the dirt to Whitehall to see whether my Lord be come to town, and I found him come and at supper, and I supped with him.

1660-12-21 14:05 r But she hears that she hath married herself to young Jermyn, which is worse than the Duke of York’s marrying the Chancellor’s daughter, which is now publicly owned.

1660-12-21 13:50   To my Lady’s, and dined with her: she told me how dangerously ill the Princess Royal is and that this morning she was said to be dead.


1660-12-20 19:00   All day at home with my workmen, that I may get all done before Christmas.

1660-12-20 14:20   I hear that the Princess Royal has the small pox.


1660-12-19 20:10   This night Mr. Gauden sent me a great chine of beef and half a dozen of tongues.

1660-12-19 15:50   I went and dined with my Lady at Whitehall, and so back again to the office, and after that home to my workmen.


1660-12-18 19:30   All day at home, without stirring at all, looking after my workmen.


1660-12-17 20:20   This day my parlour is gilded, which do please me well.

1660-12-17 16:00   To the office where both Sir Williams were come from Woolwich, and tell us that, contrary to their expectations, the Assurance is got up, without much damage to her body, only to the goods that she hath within her, which argues her to be a strong, good ship.


1660-12-16 20:40   To my Lady’s and staid with her an hour or two talking of the Duke of York and his lady, the Chancellor’s daughter, between whom, she tells me, that all is agreed and he will marry her. But I know not how true yet.

1660-12-16 18:10   With Tom Doling and Boston and D. Vines to Price’s, and there we drank, and in discourse I learnt a pretty trick to try whether a woman be a maid or no, by a string going round her head to meet at the end of her nose, which if she be not will come a great way beyond.

1660-12-16 16:05 r But that whereas it is said that he is found to have brought many arms to town, he says it is only to sell them, as he will prove by oath.

1660-12-16 16:00 r It was my lot to meet with Simon Beale, the Trumpeter, who took me and Tom Doling into the Guard in Scotland Yard, and showed us Major-General Overton, where I heard him deny that he is guilty of any such things.

1660-12-16 14:50   To White Hall, where I was surprised with the news of a plot against the King’s person and my Lord Monk’s; and that since last night there are about forty taken up on suspicion.


1660-12-15 18:40   Mr. Moore came and brought me some things to sign for the Privy Seal and dined with me. We had three eels that my wife and I bought this morning of a man, that cried them about, for our dinner, and that was all I did today.


1660-12-14 20:20   Step a little with the Comptroller to the Coffee House where we light upon very good company and had very good discourse concerning insects and their having a generative faculty as well as other creatures.


1660-12-13 17:30   All the day long looking upon my workmen who this day began to paint my parlour.

1660-12-13 13:10   My Lady Batten and my wife came home, and so I stepped to my Lady’s, where were Sir John Lawson and Captain Holmes, and there we dined and had very good red wine of my Lady’s own making in England.


1660-12-12 22:10   Home and to bed, reading myself asleep, while the wench sat mending my breeches by my bedside.

1660-12-12 20:10   To my Lady Batten, and sat an hour or two, and talked with her daughter and people in the absence of her father and mother and my wife.

1660-12-12 14:30   By coach as far as my father’s, and my father did offer me six pieces of gold, in lieu of six pounds that he borrowed of me the other day, but it went against me to take it of him and therefore did not, though I was afterwards a little troubled that I did not.


1660-12-11 16:30   Mr. Moore and I into London to a tavern near my house, and there we drank and discoursed of ways how to put out a little money to the best advantage, and at present he has persuaded me to put out 250l. for 50l. per annum for eight years, and I think I shall do it.

1660-12-11 11:40 r This last tide the Kingsale was also run aboard and lost her mainmast, by another ship, which makes us think it ominous to the Guiny voyage, to have two of her ships spoilt before they go out.

1660-12-11 10:30 r I did the first office of a justice of Peace to examine a seaman thereupon, but could find no reason to commit him.

1660-12-11 09:40 r Captain Stoakes is very melancholy, and being in search for some clothes and money of his, which he says he hath lost out of his cabin.

1660-12-11 09:00 r We found both Sir Williams and much other company, expecting the weather to be better, that they might go about weighing up the Assurance, which lies there (poor ship) under water, only the upper deck may be seen and the masts.

1660-12-11 07:30   Though the weather was very bad and the wind high, yet my Lady Batten and her maid and we two did go by our barge to Woolwich (my Lady being very fearfull).


1660-12-10 21:40   Up to bed, having first been into my study, and to ease my mind did go to cast up how my cash stands, and I do find as near as I can that I am worth in money clear 240l., for which God be praised.

1660-12-10 20:50   Home and found my wife at my Lady Batten’s, and have made a bargain to go see the ship sunk at Woolwich, where both the Sir Williams are still since yesterday, and I do resolve to go along with them.

1660-12-10 18:10   Col. Slingsby and I in the evening to the Coffee House in Cornhill, the first time that ever I was there, and I found much pleasure in it, through the diversity of company and discourse.

1660-12-10 16:30   There was a couple of men demanding money for pollmoney, and I saw myself set down Samuel Pepys, gent. 10s. for himself and for his servants 2s., which I did pay without any dispute, but I fear I have not escaped so, and therefore I have long ago laid by 10l. for them.

1660-12-10 15:12 r Sir Chas. Barkley swearing that he and others had lain with her often, which all believe to be a lie.

1660-12-10 15:10   Col. Slingsby told me that it is expected that the Duke will marry the Lord Chancellor’s daughter at last which is likely to be the ruin of Mr. Davis and my Lord Barkley, who have carried themselves so high against the Chancellor.

1660-12-10 07:00   It being a very fine, bright, moonshine morning I went and walked all alone twenty turns in Cornhill, from Gracious Street corner to the Stockes and back again, so long that I was weary.


1660-12-09 19:10   So to my father’s, where I sat while they were at supper, and I found my mother below stairs and pretty well.

1660-12-09 17:40   Dined with my Lady and staid all the afternoon with her, and had infinite of talk of all kind of things, especially of beauty of men and women, with which she seems to be much pleased to talk of.

1660-12-09 11:50   I went to chappell, and sat in Mr. Blagrave’s pew, and there did sing my part along with another before the King, and with much ease.

1660-12-09 08:10 r I went to the Duke. And first calling upon Mr. Coventry at his chamber, I went to the Duke’s bed-side, who had sat up late last night, and lay long this morning, who was much surprised, therewith.

1660-12-09 07:20 r Sir Williams both went by barge thither to see how things are, and I am sent to the Duke of York to tell him, and by boat with some other company going to Whitehall from the Old Swan.

1660-12-09 06:40   Being called up early by Sir W. Batten I rose and went to his house and he told me the ill news that he had this morning from Woolwich, that the Assurance was by a gust of wind sunk down to the bottom. Twenty men drowned.


1660-12-08 21:40 r I went to bed, having drunk so much wine that my head was troubled, and the wind I observed was rose exceedingly before I went to bed.

1660-12-08 17:30 r We had a lovely chine of beef and other good things very complete and drank a great deal of wine, and her daughter played after dinner upon the virginals, and at night by lanthorn home again.

1660-12-08 14:00   I went to dinner with my wife and Mr. and Mrs. Pierce the Surgeon to Mr. Pierce, the Purser (the first time that ever I was at his house) who does live very plentifully and finely.

1660-12-08 11:10 r I went along with Sir W. Pen by water to the office, and there with Mr. Huchinson we did find that we were in no mistake.

1660-12-08 10:00   I going into Westminster Hall met with Sir G. Carteret and Sir W. Pen (who were in a great fear that we had committed a great error of 100,000l. in our late account gone into the Parliament in making it too little).

1660-12-08 00:05   I fell a-reading Fuller’s History of Abbys, and my wife in Great Cyrus till twelve at night, and so to bed.


1660-12-07 17:50   Home by water, and there was much pleased to see that my little room is likely to come to be finished soon.

1660-12-07 15:50   To the Privy Seal, where I signed a deadly number of pardons, which do trouble me to get nothing by.

1660-12-07 14:10   To Whitehall to my Lord’s, where I found my Lord gone this morning to Huntingdon. I staid and dined with my Lady, there being Laud the page’s mother there, and dined also with us, and seemed to have been a very pretty woman and of good discourse.


1660-12-06 23:15   Home and found my girl knocking at the door, her mistress having sent her out for some trivial business, which did vex me when I came in, and so I took occasion to go up and to bed in a pet.

1660-12-06 22:40   To the bridge by water, it being a most pleasant moonshine night, with a waterman who did tell such a company of bawdy stories, how once he carried a lady from Putney, and she bade him lie down by her, which he did, and did give her content, and a great deal more roguery.

1660-12-06 20:10   By water to Parliament Stairs, and there at an alehouse to Doling; Simonds; Luellin, Mr. Mount and several others, among the rest one Mr. Pierce, an army man, who did make us the best sport for songs and stories in a Scotch tone that ever I heard in my life.

1660-12-06 16:30 r After much free discourse with my Lord, who tells me his mind as to his enlarging his family, &c., and desiring me to look him out a Master of the Horse and other servants, we parted.

1660-12-06 16:00   To my Lord, who told me of his going out of town tomorrow to settle the militia in Huntingdonshire, and did desire me to lay up a box of some rich jewels and things that there are in it, which I promised to do.

1660-12-06 13:20   Mr. Moore and I alone to the Leg in King Street, and dined together on a neat’s tongue and udder.

1660-12-06 10:50   I carried my wife to White Friars and landed her there, and myself to Whitehall to the Privy Seal, where abundance of pardons to seal, but I was much troubled for it because that there are no fees now coming for them to me.

1660-12-06 08:30   One came to me to give me notice that the justices of Middlesex do meet tomorrow at Hicks Hall, and that I as one am desired to be there, but I fear I cannot be there though I much desire it.


1660-12-05 19:20   I went to my father’s and there found my mother still ill of the stone, and had just newly voided one, which she had let drop into the chimney, and looked and found it to show it me.

1660-12-05 17:00   I went to the new Theatre and there I saw “The Merry Wives of Windsor” acted, the humours of the country gentleman and the French doctor very well done, but the rest but very poorly, and Sir J. Falstaffe as bad as any.

1660-12-05 08:30   The Proposal which I wrote the last night I showed to the officers this morning, and was well liked of, and I wrote it fair for Sir. G. Carteret to show to the King, and so it is to go to the Parliament.

1660-12-05 01:20 r And there I staid looking upon them till one o’clock in the morning, and so Sir W. Pen and I went away, and I to bed.


1660-12-04 18:30   I home by water, and with Mr. Hater in my chamber all alone he and I did put this morning’s design into order, which being done I did carry it to Sir W. Batten, where I found some gentlemen with him (Sir W. Pen among the rest pretty merry with drink) playing at cards.

1660-12-04 18:25 r Which (methinks) do trouble me that a man of so great courage as he was, should have that dishonour, though otherwise he might deserve it enough.

1660-12-04 18:10   The Parliament voted that the bodies of Oliver, Ireton, Bradshaw, &c., should be taken up out of their graves in the Abbey, and drawn to the gallows, and there hanged and buried under it.

1660-12-04 11:20 r This he do like, and we returned by his order to Sir G. Carteret’s chamber, and there we did draw up this design in order to be presented to the Parliament.

1660-12-04 11:05 r We did open to him our project of stopping the growing charge of the fleet by paying them in hand one moyety, and the other four months hence.

1660-12-04 09:40   Whitehall to Sir G. Carteret’s chamber, where all the officers met, and so we went up to the Duke of York, and he took us into his closet.


1660-12-03 23:00   I fell a reading ‘Cornelianum dolium’ till 11 o’clock at night with great pleasure, and after that to bed.

1660-12-03 19:10 r Mr. Davis sat with me a good while after the other was gone, talking of his hard usage and of the endeavour to put him out of his place in the time of the late Commissioners, and he do speak very highly of their corruption.

1660-12-03 18:35 r They both found me under the barber’s hand; but I had a bottle of good sack in the house, and so made them very welcome.

1660-12-03 18:20   To the office till night, and so home, and then come Mr. Davis, of Deptford (the first time that ever he was at my house), and after him Mons. L’Impertinent, who is to go to Ireland tomorrow, and so came to take his leave of me.

1660-12-03 13:50   After office home to dinner, where come in my cozen Snow by chance, and I had a very good capon to dinner.

1660-12-03 10:30 r Sir G. Carteret did discourse on Mr. Holland’s proposition which the King do take ill, and so Sir George in lieu of that do propose that the seamen should have half in ready money and tickets for the other half, to be paid in three months after, which we judge to be practicable.

1660-12-03 09:00   I took a resolution to rise early in the morning, and so I rose by candle, which I have not done all this winter, and spent my morning in fiddling till time to go to the office.


1660-12-02 22:40   After sermon took Tom Fuller’s Church History and read over Henry the 8th’s life in it, and so to supper and to bed.

1660-12-02 13:30   My wife and I all alone to a leg of mutton, the sawce of which being made sweet, I was angry at it, and eat none, but only dined upon the marrow bone that we had beside.

1660-12-02 08:00   My head not very well, and my body out of order by last night’s drinking, which is my great folly.


1660-12-01 19:20   To Paul’s Churchyard, and there I took the little man at Mr. Kirton’s and Mr. Shepley to Ringstead’s at the Star, and after a pint of wine I went home, my brains somewhat troubled with so much wine.

1660-12-01 15:10   Mr. Shepley and I went into London, and calling upon Mr. Pinkney he took us to the tavern and gave us a pint of wine, and there fell into our company Mr. Flower and another gentleman; who tell us how a Scotch knight was killed basely the other day at the Fleece in Covent Garden.

1660-12-01 11:50   To my Lord’s, and did give up my audit of his accounts, which I had been then two days about, and was well received by my Lord.

1660-12-01 11:20   I went to my Lord St. Albans lodgings, and found him in bed, talking to a priest (he looked like one) that leaned along over the side of the bed, and there I desired to know his mind about making the catch stay longer, which I got ready for him the other day.

1660-12-01 09:10   Observing some things to be laid up not as they should be by the girl, I took a broom and basted her till she cried extremely, which made me vexed, but before I went out I left her appeased.
