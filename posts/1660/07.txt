1660-07-31 22:50   Late home by coach so far as Ludgate with Mr. Mathews, and thence home on foot with W. Hewer with me, and so to bed.

1660-07-31 21:30 r I took them to the Sun Tavern and there made them drink, and discoursed concerning the office, and what I was to expect tomorrow about Baron, who pretends to the next month.

1660-07-31 20:10   I went to the Privy Seal, where I found Mr. Crofts and Mathews making up all their things to leave the office tomorrow, to those that come to wait the next month.

1660-07-31 17:10   I to the Admiralty, and there was doing things in order to the calculating of the debts of the Navy and other business.

1660-07-31 09:50   To White Hall, where my Lord and the principal officers met, and had a great discourse about raising of money for the Navy, which is in very sad condition, and money must be raised for it.


1660-07-30 21:40   Took Mr. Moore and his friend to the Rhenish Winehouse, and drinking there the sword-bearer of London (Mr. Man) came to ask for us, with whom we sat, discoursing about the worth of my office of Clerk of the Acts, which he hath a mind to buy, and I asked four years’ purchase.

1660-07-30 15:45   I got my 50l., due to me for my first quarter’s salary as Secretary to my Lord, paid to Tho. Hater for me, which he received and brought home to me, of which I am full glad.

1660-07-30 10:30   My father came this day the first time to see us at my new office. And Mrs. Crisp by chance came in and sat with us, looked over our house and advised about the furnishing of it.


1660-07-29 17:40 r Of this I was glad, and do think myself worth clear money about 120l.

1660-07-29 17:20   With Dick Vines and his brother Payton, we walked to Lisson Green and Marybone and back again, and finding my Lord at home I got him to look over my accounts, which he did approve of and signed them, and so we are even to this day.

1660-07-29 14:10   My Lord went to dinner at Kensington with my Lord Camden. So I dined and took Mr. Birfett, my Lord’s chaplain, and his friend along with me, with Mr. Sheply at my Lord’s.

1660-07-29 11:20   I and my boy Will to Whitehall, and I with my Lord to White Hall Chappell, where I heard a cold sermon of the Bishop of Salisbury’s, and the ceremonies did not please me, they do so overdo them.


1660-07-28 15:50 r I went with him to the Swan Tavern and sent for Mr. Butler, who was now all full of his high discourse in praise of Ireland, whither he and his whole family are going by Coll. Dillon’s persuasion, but so many lies I never heard in praise of anything as he told of Ireland.

1660-07-28 14:40   To Westminster, and there dined with Mr. Sheply and W. Howe, afterwards meeting with Mr. Henson, who had formerly had the brave clock that went with bullets (which is now taken away from him by the King, it being his goods).

1660-07-28 06:00   A boy brought me a letter from Poet Fisher, who tells me that he is upon a panegyrique of the King, and desired to borrow a piece of me; and I sent him half a piece.


1660-07-27 22:30 r We got a coach, but the horses were tired and could not carry us farther than St. Dunstan’s. So we ’light and took a link and so home weary to bed.

1660-07-27 21:10 r I sent to W. Bowyer to bring me 100l., being that he had in his hands of my Lord’s. in keeping, out of which I paid Mr. Sheply all that remained due to my Lord upon my balance, and took the rest home with me late at night.

1660-07-27 20:10   To my Lord’s where Will, my clerk, and I were all the afternoon making up my accounts, which we had done by night, and I find myself worth about 100l. after all my expenses.


1660-07-26 23:10 r I sent to my Lord’s for my clerk Will to come to me, and so by link home to bed. Where I found Commissioner Willoughby had sent for all his things away out of my bedchamber, which is a little disappointment, but it is better than pay too dear for them.

1660-07-26 22:00   I met with T. Doling, who carried me to St. James’s Fair, and there meeting with W. Symons and his wife, and Luellin, and D. Scobell’s wife and cousin, we went to Wood’s at the Pell Mell (our old house for clubbing).

1660-07-26 16:10   I was told how Baron against all expectation and law has got the place of Bickerstaffe, and so I question whether he will not lay claim to wait the next month, but my Lord tells me that he will stand for it.

1660-07-26 15:30   I met Dr. Castle, who is one of the Clerks of the Privy Seal, and told him how things were with my Lord and me, which he received very gladly.

1660-07-26 14:20   I at the Privy Seal Office with Mr. Hooker, who brought me acquainted with Mr. Crofts of the Signet, and I invited them to a dish of meat at the Leg in King Street, and so we dined there and I paid for all and had very good light given me as to my employment there.

1660-07-26 11:20   To White Hall, thinking to have a meeting of my Lord, but my Lord could not, it being the day that he was to go and be admitted in the House of Lords, his patent being done, which he presented upon his knees to the Speaker; and so it was read in the House, and he took his place.


1660-07-25 21:40   Very late home and called in Tower Street, and there at a barber’s was trimmed the first time.

1660-07-25 11:40   My Lord took leave of the House of Commons, and had the thanks of the House for his great services to his country.

1660-07-25 10:30   Down to Whitehall, where I met with Mr. Creed, and with him and a Welsh schoolmaster, a good scholar but a very pedagogue, to the ordinary at the Leg in King Street.


1660-07-24 09:40   To White Hall, where I did acquaint Mr. Watkins with my being sworn into the Privy Seal, at which he was much troubled, but put it up and did offer me a kinsman of his to be my clerk, which I did give him some hope of, though I never intend it.


1660-07-23 21:40   I was troubled all this day with Mr. Cooke, being willing to do him good, but my mind is so taken up with my own business that I cannot.

1660-07-23 18:10   My Lord had heard that Mr. Barnwell was dead, but it is not so yet, though he be very ill.

1660-07-23 14:15   My Lord took me to Secretary Nicholas, and there before him and Secretary Morris, my Lord and I upon our knees together took our oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy; and the Oath of the Privy Seal, of which I was much glad, though I am not likely to get anything by it at present.

1660-07-23 10:00   Mr. Barlow comes to me, and he and I went forth to a scrivener in Fenchurch Street, whom we found sick of the gout in bed, and signed and sealed our agreement before him.


1660-07-22 22:10   Home, and had a chapter read; and I read prayers out of the Common Prayer Book, the first time that ever I read prayers in this house. So to bed.

1660-07-22 16:20   I left him and went to walk in the Park, where great endeavouring to get into the inward Park, but could not get in; one man was basted by the keeper, for carrying some people over on his back through the water.

1660-07-22 15:00   To White Hall (my wife to church with K. Joyce), where I find my Lord at home, and walked in the garden with him, he showing me all the respect that can be.

1660-07-22 13:10   I went out and looked into several churches, and so to my uncle Fenner’s, whither my wife was got before me, and we, my father and mother, and all the Joyces, and my aunt Bell, whom I had not seen many a year before.

1660-07-22 10:00   My brother Tom came the first time to see me, and I paid him all that I owe my father to this day.


1660-07-21 23:00   So to my house to write letters and so to Whitehall about business of my Lord’s concerning his creation, and so home and to bed.

1660-07-21 13:50   Went to the Six Clerks’ office to Mr. Spong for the writings, and dined with him at a club at the next door, where we had three voices to sing catches.

1660-07-21 10:30   To my Lord and spoke to him about the business of the Privy Seal for me to be sworn, though I got nothing by it, but to do Mr. Moore a kindness, which he did give me a good answer to.

1660-07-21 09:20   Mr. Barlow had appointed for me to bring him what form I would have the agreement between him and me to pass, which I did to his lodgings at the Golden Eagle, where he liked it very well, and I from him went to get Mr. Spong to engross it in duplicates.


1660-07-20 16:50  To Westminster about my Lord’s business and so home, my Lord having not been well these two or three days, and I hear that Mr. Barnwell at Hinchinbroke is fallen sick again.

1660-07-20 14:10 r I did this time show so much coldness to W. Joyce that I believe all the table took notice of it.

1660-07-20 13:15 r I went to my father’s, where my Uncle Fenner and all his crew and Captain Holland and his wife and my wife were at dinner at a venison pasty of the venison that I did give my mother the other day.

1660-07-20 11:20   I sent my wife to my father’s and he is to give me 5l. worth of pewter.


1660-07-19 21:50   Great talk of the difference between the Episcopal and Presbyterian Clergy, but I believe it will come to nothing.

1660-07-19 14:00   I went to Westminster Hall, where I took Mr. Michell and his wife, to the Dog Tavern, where I did give them a dish of anchovies and olives and paid for all, and did talk of our old discourse when we did use to talk of the King, in the time of the Rump, privately.

1660-07-19 11:20 r I received my commission to swear people the oath of allegiance and supremacy delivered me by my Lord.

1660-07-19 10:30   I to my Lord and found him in bed.

1660-07-19 09:45   I and my wife by water, landed her at Whitefriars with her boy with an iron of our new range which is already broke and my wife will have changed, and many other things she has to buy with the help of my father today.

1660-07-19 09:10   I did lie late a-bed.


1660-07-18 22:30   My mind very quiet, only a little trouble I have for the great debts which I have still upon me to the Secretary, Mr. Kipps, and Mr. Spong for my patent.

1660-07-18 22:20   Home, where W. Hewer now was, and did lie this night with us, the first night.

1660-07-18 21:10 r I did carry it to my mother, where I had not been a great while, and indeed had no great mind to go, because my father did lay upon me continually to do him a kindness at the Wardrobe, which I could not do because of my own business being so fresh with my Lord.

1660-07-18 20:30   To my Lord about business, and being in talk in comes one with half a buck from Hinchinbroke, and it smelling a little strong my Lord did give it me (though it was as good as any could be).

1660-07-18 15:40   I did meet with Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, with a porter with him, with a barrel of Lemons, which my man Burr sends me from sea.

1660-07-18 10:20   The carpenter made an end of my door out of my chamber upon the leads.


1660-07-17 23:10   I to bed the first night that I ever lay here with my wife.

1660-07-17 22:30 r I went on foot with a linkboy to my home, where I found my wife in bed and Jane washing the house, and Will the boy sleeping, and a great deal of sport I had before I could wake him.

1660-07-17 21:20   Will, Mr. Blackburne’s nephew, is so obedient, that I am greatly glad of him.

1660-07-17 20:40 r Being come to my house and set in the goods, and sent my wife and Mrs. Hunt to buy something for supper; they bought a Quarter of Lamb, and so we ate it, but it was not half roasted.

1660-07-17 16:20   I went home and got all my goods packed up and sent away, and my wife and I and Mrs. Hunt went by coach, overtaking the carts a-drinking in the Strand.

1660-07-17 08:50 r Going to my Lord’s I found my Lord had got a great cold and kept his bed, and so I brought him to my Lord’s bedside, and he and I did agree together to this purpose what I should allow him.

1660-07-17 08:20   There came to my house Mr. Barlow, an old consumptive man, and fair conditioned, and after much talk I did grant him what he asked, viz., 50l. per annum, if my salary be not increased, at which he was very well pleased to be paid as I received my money and not otherwise.


1660-07-16 13:00   This morning it proved very rainy weather so that I could not remove my goods to my house.


1660-07-15 21:40 r My patent has cost me a great deal of money, about 40l., which is the only thing at present which do trouble me much.

1660-07-15 21:20 r My wife and I mightily pleased with our new house that we hope to have.

1660-07-15 21:10 r For this month I have wholly neglected anything of news, and so have beyond belief been ignorant how things go, but now by my patent my mind is in some quiet, which God keep.

1660-07-15 20:50   My wife at home all the day, she having no clothes out, all being packed up yesterday.

1660-07-15 20:30   So to Harper’s and drank together, and Captain Stokes came to us and so I fell into discourse of buying paper at the first hand in my office, and the Captain promised me to buy it for me in France.

1660-07-15 15:30   To Henry the Seventh’s chapel, where I heard a sermon and spent (God forgive me) most of my time in looking upon Mrs. Butler.

1660-07-15 13:40   After dinner my Lord and I alone fell to discourse, and I find him plainly to be a sceptic in all things of religion, and to make no great matter of anything therein, but to be a perfect Stoic.

1660-07-15 11:30   Going forth met with Mr. Sheply, and went and drank my morning draft with him at Wilkinson’s, and my brother Spicer. After that to Westminster Abbey, and in Henry the Seventh’s Chappell heard part of a sermon, the first that ever I heard there.

1660-07-15 08:30   Lay long in bed to recover my rest.


1660-07-14 22:30   So to my Lord’s late writing letters, and so home, where I found my wife had packed up all her goods in the house fit for a removal. So to bed.

1660-07-14 17:20 r Into Fenchurch Street, and did give Mr. Butler a glass of wine at Rawlinson’s, and was trimmed in the street.

1660-07-14 16:30 r I took Mr. Butler with me into London by coach and showed him my house at the Navy Office. And did give order for the laying in coals.

1660-07-14 13:50   I met with Mr. Eglin, who would needs take me to the Leg in King Street and gave me a dish of meat to dinner; and so I sent for Mons. L’Impertinent, where we sat long and were merry.

1660-07-14 11:30   To Westminster Hall, where I paid all my debts in order to my going away from hence.

1660-07-14 10:50   So to my Lord’s, where I staid doing his business and taking his commands.

1660-07-14 10:00 r While we were doing so, comes in Mr. Pagan Fisher; the poet, and promises me what he had long ago done, a book in praise of the King of France, with my armes, and a dedication to me very handsome.

1660-07-14 09:40   To my Lord’s, where he was in bed very late. So with Major Tollhurst and others to Harper’s, and I sent for my barrel of pickled oysters and there ate them.

1660-07-14 06:10   Up early and advised with my wife for the putting of all our things in a readiness to be sent to our new house.


1660-07-13 23:00   To bed with the greatest quiet of mind that I have had a great while, having ate nothing but a bit of bread and cheese at Lilly’s today, and a bit of bread and butter after I was a-bed.

1660-07-13 22:15 r Here at the old door that did go into his lodgings, my Lord, I, and W. Howe, did stand listening a great while to the music.

1660-07-13 21:40   Late writing letters; and great doings of music at the next house, which was Whally’s; the King and Dukes there with Madame Palmer, a pretty woman that they have a fancy to, to make her husband a cuckold.

1660-07-13 16:30 r So to the Navy office, and showed her my house, and were both mightily pleased at all things there, and so to my business.

1660-07-13 16:10 r Went home and brought my wife with me into London, and some money, with which I paid Mr. Beale 9l. in all, and took my patent of him and went to my wife again, whom I had left in a coach at the door of Hinde Court, and presented her with my patent at which she was overjoyed.

1660-07-13 14:40 r To Worcester House, where by Mr. Kipps’s means, and my pressing in General Montagu’s name to the Chancellor, I did, beyond all expectation, get my seal passed.

1660-07-13 12:30   Much troubled in mind about my patent, I went to Mr. Beale again, who had now finished my patent and made it ready for the Seal.

1660-07-13 11:40   I went to the Navy office, where we despatched much business, and resolved of the houses for the Officers and Commissioners, which I was glad of, and I got leave to have a door made me into the leads.

1660-07-13 10:20 r By much importunity I got Mr. Spong to go to his office and make an end of my patent; and in the mean time Mr. Beale to be preparing my dockett, which being done, I did give him two pieces, after which it was strange how civil and tractable he was to me.

1660-07-13 09:10 r And so carried it to Mr. Beale for a dockett; but he was very angry, and unwilling to do it, because he said it was ill writ (because I had got it writ by another hand, and not by him).

1660-07-13 08:30 r It being done, we carried it to Worcester House to the Chancellor, where Mr. Kipps (a strange providence that he should now be in a condition to do me a kindness, which I never thought him capable of doing for me), got me the Chancellor’s recepi to my bill.

1660-07-13 08:00   To Mr. Spong, whom I found in his night-down writing of my patent, and he had done as far as he could “for that &c.” by 8 o’clock.

1660-07-13 06:00   Up early, the first day that I put on my black camlett coat with silver buttons.


1660-07-12 23:30   In great trouble because I heard at Mr. Beale’s today that Barlow had been there and said that he would make a stop in the business.

1660-07-12 23:00 r To Mr. Kipps’s lodgings, but not finding him, I went to Mr. Spong’s and there I found him and got him to come to me to my Lord’s lodgings, when I got him to take my bill to write it himself (which was a great providence that he could do it) against tomorrow morning.

1660-07-12 10:50 r And so in a despair went to the Admiralty, where we met the first time there, my Lord Montagu, my Lord Barkley, Mr. Coventry, and all the rest of the principal Officers and Commissioners, only the Controller, who is not yet chosen.

1660-07-12 09:50 r But he not having time to get it done in Chancery-hand, I was forced to run all up and down Chancery-lane, and the Six Clerks’ Office but could find none that could write the hand, that were at leisure.

1660-07-12 09:30   By coach to White Hall with Commissioner Pett, where, after we had talked with my Lord, I went to the Privy Seal and got my bill perfected there, and then to the House of Lords, and met with Mr. Kipps, who directed me to Mr. Beale to get my patent engrossed.


1660-07-11 17:20   To White Hall, and took out my bill signed by the King, and carried it to Mr. Watkins of the Privy Seal to be despatched there.

1660-07-11 16:30   To the office again, where I was vexed, and so was Commissioner Pett, to see a busy fellow come to look out the best lodgings for my Lord Barkley, and the combining between him and Sir W. Pen; and, indeed, was troubled much at it.

1660-07-11 14:10   With Sir W. Pen by water to the Navy office, where we met, and dispatched business. And that being done, we went all to dinner to the Dolphin, upon Major Brown’s invitation.


1660-07-10 20:40   Home, with my mind pretty quiet: not returning, as I said I would, to see the bride put to bed.

1660-07-10 18:10   Finding my Lord in White Hall garden, I got him to go to the Secretary’s, which he did, and desired the dispatch of his and my bills to be signed by the King. His bill is to be Earl of Sandwich, Viscount Hinchingbroke, and Baron of St. Neot’s.

1660-07-10 12:10 r But, among all the beauties there, my wife was thought the greatest.

1660-07-10 11:40   Home, and called my wife, and took her to Dr. Clodius’s to a great wedding of Nan Hartlib to Mynheer Roder, which was kept at Goring House with very great state, cost, and noble company.

1660-07-10 09:10   Came Nan Pepys’ husband Mr. Hall to see me being lately come to town. I had never seen him before. I took him to the Swan tavern with Mr. Eglin and there drank our morning draft.

1660-07-10 07:10   This day I put on first my new silk suit, the first that ever I wore in my life.


1660-07-09 19:10   Captain Holland and Mr. Browne of Harwich took me to a tavern and did give me a collation.

1660-07-09 14:30   To the Navy office, where we met and sat, and there I begun to sign bills in the Office the first time.


1660-07-08 20:30   Mr. Fairebrother came to call us out to my father’s to supper. He told me how he had perfectly procured me to be made Master in Arts by proxy, which did somewhat please me, though I remember my cousin Roger Pepys was the other day persuading me from it.

1660-07-08 11:40 r The Bishop of Chichester preached before the King, and made a great flattering sermon, which I did not like that Clergy should meddle with matters of state.

1660-07-08 11:10   To White Hall chapel, where I got in with ease by going before the Lord Chancellor with Mr. Kipps. Here I heard very good music, the first time that ever I remember to have heard the organs and singing-men in surplices in my life.


1660-07-07 16:10   To the Navy Office, where I began to take an inventory of the papers, and goods, and books of the office.

1660-07-07 13:50   To the Change, where I bought two fine prints of Ragotts from Rubens, and afterwards dined with my Uncle and Aunt Wight, where her sister Cox and her husband were.

1660-07-07 09:50   To the Council Chamber, where I took an order for the advance of the salaries of the officers of the Navy, and I find mine to be raised to 350l. per annum.


1660-07-06 22:20   To my Lord’s, where in the dark W. Howe and I did sing extemporys, and I find by use that we are able to sing a bass and a treble pretty well.

1660-07-06 19:40   Called at Mr. Pim’s, about getting me a coat of velvet, and he took me to the Half Moon, and the house so full that we staid above half an hour before we could get anything.

1660-07-06 16:30   Calling upon Sir Geoffry Palmer, who did give me advice about my patent, which put me to some doubt to know what to do, Barlow being alive.

1660-07-06 15:10   My Lord and I, and Mr. Coventry and Sir G. Carteret, went and took possession of the Navy Office, whereby my mind was a little cheered, but my hopes not great.

1660-07-06 13:30   To my Lord’s and dined with W. Howe and Sarah, thinking it might be the last time that I might dine with them together.

1660-07-06 09:50   To Westminster Hall, and there met with the Doctor that showed us so much kindness at the Hague, and took him to the Sun tavern, and drank with him.

1660-07-06 08:50   With my Lord at Whitehall, got the order of the Council for us to act.


1660-07-05 22:10   At my Lord’s comes Dr. Petty to me, to tell me that Barlow had come to town, and other things, which put me into a despair, and I went to bed very sad.

1660-07-05 14:00   Met with Mr. Cooling, my Lord Chamberlain’s secretary, who took me to dinner among the gentlemen waiters, and after dinner into the wine-cellar. He told me how he had a project for all us Secretaries to join together, and get money by bringing all business into our hands.

1660-07-05 11:50   Being at White Hall, I saw the King, the Dukes, and all their attendants go forth in the rain to the City, and it bedraggled many a fine suit of clothes. I was forced to walk all the morning in White Hall, not knowing how to get out because of the rain.

1660-07-05 09:50   Mr. Hater was with me, and I agreed with him to be my clerk.

1660-07-05 09:10   It rained, which makes us fear that the glory of this great day will be lost; the King and Parliament being to be entertained by the City today with great pomp.

1660-07-05 08:40   My brother Tom brought me my jackanapes coat with silver buttons.


1660-07-04 20:50   My Lord told me how my orders that I drew last night about giving us power to act, are granted by the Council. At which he and I were very glad.

1660-07-04 17:20   To my Lord’s, and walking all the afternoon in White Hall Court, in expectation of what shall be done in the Council as to our business. It was strange to see how all the people flocked together bare, to see the King looking out of the Council window.

1660-07-04 16:00   To Westminster Hall, where meeting with M. L’Impertinent and W. Bowyer, I took them to the Sun Tavern, and gave them a lobster and some wine, and sat talking like a fool till 4 o’clock.

1660-07-04 10:10 r To Mr. Backewell’s, the goldsmith, where I took my Lord’s 100l. in plate for Mr. Secretary Nicholas, and my own piece of plate, being a state dish and cup in chased work for Mr. Coventry, cost me above 19l.

1660-07-04 09:30   To the Excise Office in Broad Street, where I received 500l. for my Lord, by appointment of the Treasurer, and went afterwards down with Mr. Luddyard and drank my morning draft with him and other officers.

1660-07-04 08:20 r At his house comes Commissioner Pett, and he and I went to view the houses in Seething Lane, belonging to the Navy, where I find the worst very good, and had great fears in my mind that they will shuffle me out of them, which troubles me.

1660-07-04 07:10   Landing my wife at White Friars stairs, I went to the Bridge and so to the Treasurer’s of the Navy, with whom I spake about the business of my office, who put me into very good hopes of my business.

1660-07-04 02:05   Till 2 in the morning writing letters and things for my Lord to send to sea.


1660-07-03 22:15 r I met with my Lord, who told me that I need not fear, for he would get me the place against the world.

1660-07-03 15:40 r When I came to W. Howe, he told me that Dr. Petty had been with my Lord, and did tell him that Barlow was a sickly man, and did not intend to execute the place himself, which put me in great comfort again.

1660-07-03 15:10   My heart was quite pulled down, by being told that Mr. Barlow was to enquire today for Mr. Coventry.

1660-07-03 14:00   Dined with Mr. Stephens, the Treasurer’s man of the Navy, and Mr. Turner, to whom I offered 50l. out of my own purse for one year, and the benefit of a Clerk’s allowance beside, which he thanked me for; but I find he hath some design yet in his head, which I could not think of.

1660-07-03 10:20   All the morning the Officers and Commissioners of the Navy, we met at Sir G. Carteret’s chamber, and agreed upon orders for the Council to supersede the old ones, and empower us to act.


1660-07-02 22:10   Supped with my Lord, he and I together, in the great dining-room alone by ourselves, the first time I ever did it in London. Home to bed, my maid pretty well again.

1660-07-02 19:15 r We had order to meet tomorrow, to draw up such an order of the Council as would put us into action before our patents were passed. At which my heart was glad.

1660-07-02 19:00   My Lord went home, and there the principal Officers of the Navy, among the rest myself was reckoned one.

1660-07-02 17:10   All the afternoon with my Lord, going up and down the town.

1660-07-02 13:50   Met with purser Washington, with whom and a lady, a friend of his, I dined at the Bell Tavern in King Street, but the rogue had no more manners than to invite me and to let me pay my club.

1660-07-02 11:40   Infinite of business that my heart and head and all were full.


1660-07-01 22:40   To my Lord’s, where late at night comes Mr. Morland, whom I left prating with my Lord, and so home.

1660-07-01 16:40   Called in at Mrs. Crisp’s, where I saw Mynheer Roder, that is to marry Sam Hartlib’s sister, a great fortune for her to light on, she being worth nothing in the world.

1660-07-01 15:10   To the Abbey, where a good sermon by a stranger, but no Common Prayer yet.

1660-07-01 13:30   I went to the cook’s and got a good joint of meat, and my wife and I dined at home alone.

1660-07-01 09:20   Came home my fine Camlett cloak, with gold buttons, and a silk suit, which cost me much money, and I pray God to make me able to pay for it.
