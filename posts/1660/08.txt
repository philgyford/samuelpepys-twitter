1660-08-31 22:40   Blessed be God all things continue well with and for me. I pray God fit me for a change of my fortune.

1660-08-31 16:30   I agreed to let my house quite out of my hands to Mr. Dalton (one of the wine sellers to the King, with whom I had drunk in the old wine cellar two or three times) for 41l.

1660-08-31 14:20 r To my Lord again, who told me that he is ordered to go suddenly to sea, and did give me some orders to be drawing up against his going.

1660-08-31 07:10   Early to wait upon my Lord at White Hall, and with him to the Duke’s chamber.


1660-08-30 15:30   This the first day that ever I saw my wife wear black patches since we were married!

1660-08-30 15:10   My wife went to Mr. Pierce’s wife’s child’s christening, and was urged to be godmother, but I advised her before-hand not to do it, so she did not, but as proxy for my Lady Jemimah.

1660-08-30 13:50   At Westminster Hall I met with Mr. Paget the lawyer, and dined with him at Heaven.

1660-08-30 11:40   To White Hall, where I met with the Act of Indemnity (so long talked of and hoped for), with the Act of Rate for Pole-money, and for judicial proceedings.

1660-08-30 07:20 r We found all well in the morning below stairs, but the boy in a sad plight of seeming sorrow; but he is the most cunning rogue that ever I met with of his age.


1660-08-29 23:32 r But the wench went down and got a candle lighted, and finding the boy in bed, and locking the doors fast, with a candle burning, we slept well, but with a great deal of fear.

1660-08-29 23:21 r The noise was the boy, we did believe, got in a desperate mood out of his bed to do himself or William some mischief.

1660-08-29 23:10 r But after we were all a-bed, the wench (which lies in our chamber) called us to listen of a sudden, which put my wife into such a fright that she shook every joint of her, and a long time that I could not get her out of it.

1660-08-29 22:10 r To bed, and caused the boy’s clothes to be brought up to my chamber.

1660-08-29 20:50 r Home, and find that my wife had found out more of the boy’s stealing 6s. out of W. Hewer’s closet, and hid it in the house of office, at which my heart was troubled.

1660-08-29 20:20 r To my father’s, and he being at my uncle Fenner’s, I went thither to him, and there sent for my boy’s father and talked with him about his son, and had his promise that if I will send home his boy, he will take him notwithstanding his indenture.

1660-08-29 12:30 r Home to dinner, and there I found my wife had discovered my boy Will’s theft and a great deal more than we imagined, at which I was vexed and intend to put him away.

1660-08-29 11:10 r To the Church, where we took another view of the place where we had resolved to build a gallery, and have set men about doing it.

1660-08-29 07:50 r Before I went to the office my wife and I examined my boy Will about his stealing of things, but he denied all with the greatest subtlety and confidence in the world.


1660-08-28 22:15   To bed, a little troubled that I fear my boy Will is a thief and has stole some money of mine, particularly a letter that Mr. Jenkins did leave the last week with me with half a crown in it to send to his son.

1660-08-28 21:30   This day I heard my poor mother had then two days been very ill, and I fear she will not last long.

1660-08-28 20:40   I carried home 80l. from the Privy Seal, by coach, and at night spent a little more time with my wife about her music with great content.

1660-08-28 14:00   At home looking over my papers and books and house as to the fitting of it to my mind.

1660-08-28 10:50   Some time I spent this morning beginning to teach my wife some scale in music, and found her apt beyond imagination.

1660-08-28 03:50   About 10 o’clock Major Hart came to me, whom I did receive with wine and anchovies, which made me so dry that I was ill with them all night, and was fain to have the girle rise and fetch me some drink.


1660-08-27 11:10 r These things came up today in our smack, and my boy Ely came along with them, and came after office was done to see me. I did give him half a crown because I saw that he was ready to cry to see that he could not be entertained by me here.

1660-08-27 10:50   Comes one with a vessel of Northdown ale from Mr. Pierce, the purser, to me, and after him another with a brave Turkey carpet and a jar of olives from Captain Cuttance, and a pair of fine turtle-doves from John Burr to my wife.


1660-08-26 22:50   In the garden and on the leads at night, and so to supper and to bed.

1660-08-26 11:40   With Sir W. Pen to the parish church, where we are placed in the highest pew of all, where a stranger preached a dry and tedious long sermon.


1660-08-25 22:40   This night W. Hewer brought me home from Mr. Pim’s my velvet coat and cap, the first that ever I had. So to bed.

1660-08-25 19:20   To Westminster Hall for a new half-shirt of Mrs. Lane, and so home by water.

1660-08-25 14:20 r There coming to us Mr. Fowler the apothecary (the judge’s son) with a book of lute lessons which his father had left there for me, such as he formerly did use to play when a young man, and had the use of his hand.

1660-08-25 13:50 r I took Mr. Turner and Mr. Moore to the Leg in King Street, and did give them a dinner, and afterward to the Sun Tavern, and did give Mr. Turner a glass of wine.

1660-08-25 10:20   Mr. Turner and I by coach from our office to Whitehall to Sir G. Carteret, where we there made up an estimate of the debts of the Navy for the Council.


1660-08-24 22:30   Into Paul’s Churchyard and bought Barkley’s Argenis in Latin, and so home and to bed. I found at home that Captain Bun had sent me 4 dozen bottles of wine today.

1660-08-24 21:30 r My father came in, and Dr. T. Pepys, who talked with me in French about looking out for a place for him. But I found him a weak man, and speaks the worst French that ever I heard of one that had been so long beyond sea.

1660-08-24 20:50   By land to my father’s, where I found my mother not very well. I did give her a pint of sack.

1660-08-24 12:40 r Hence with them to dinner at a tavern in Thames Street, where they were invited to a roasted haunch of venison and other very good victuals and company.

1660-08-24 11:30   Office, and thence with Sir William Batten and Sir William Pen to the parish church to find out a place where to build a seat or a gallery to sit in, and did find one which is to be done speedily.


1660-08-23 17:50   With W. Symons, T. Doling, and Mr. Booth, to the Dogg, where we eat a musk melon (the first that I have eat this year), and were very merry with W. Symons, calling him Mr. Dean, because of the Dean’s lands that his uncle had left him, which are like to be lost all.

1660-08-23 14:00   To Westminster Hall, where I met with my father Bowyer, and Mr. Spicer, and them I took to the Leg in King Street, and did give them a dish or two of meat.

1660-08-23 08:10   By water to Doctors’ Commons to Dr. Walker, to give him my Lord’s papers to view over concerning his being empowered to be Vice-Admiral under the Duke of York.


1660-08-22 16:40   Mr. G. Montagu told me how there was like to be many factions at Court between Marquis Ormond, General Monk, and the Lord Roberts, about the business of Ireland; as there is already between the two Houses about the Act of Indemnity,

1660-08-22 14:10 r Mr. Hater and I to the office about doing something more as to the debts of the Navy than I had done yesterday.

1660-08-22 13:10 r I took Mr. Hater home with me to dinner, with whom I did advise, who did give me the same counsel.

1660-08-22 11:20   Sir W. Pen told me how Mr. Turner do intend to petition the Duke for an allowance extra as one of the Clerks of the Navy, which he desired me to join with him in the furthering of, which I promised to do so that it did not reflect upon me or to my damage to have any other added.


1660-08-21 20:30   I home by coach, and there, it being post-night, I wrote to my Lord to give him notice that all things are well; that General Monk is made Lieutenant of Ireland, which my Lord Roberts (made Deputy) do not like of, to be Deputy to any man but the King himself.

1660-08-21 15:40   Towards Westminster, where I called on Mr. Pim, and there found my velvet coat (the first that ever I had) done, and a velvet mantle, which I took to the Privy Seal Office, and there locked them up.

1660-08-21 14:20   To Westminster Hall, where there dined one Mr. Hickeman, an Oxford man, who spoke very much against the height of the now old clergy, for putting out many of the religious fellows of Colleges, and inveighing against them for their being drunk, which, if true, I am sorry to hear.


1660-08-20 22:30   I found all my things come home from sea (sent by desire by Mr. Dun), of which I was glad, though many of my things are quite spoilt with mould by reason of lying so long a shipboard, and my cabin being not tight. I spent much time to dispose of them tonight, and so to bed.

1660-08-20 21:20 r Before he would begin any business, he took my papers of the state of the debts of the Fleet, and there viewed them before all the people, and did give me his advice privately how to order things, to get as much money as we can of the Parliament.

1660-08-20 20:55 r Here I staid, and saw my Lord Chancellor come into his Great Hall, where wonderful how much company there was to expect him at a Seal.

1660-08-20 19:20   I went all alone to drink at Mr. Harper’s, where I found Mrs. Crisp’s daughter, with whom and her friends I staid and drank, and so with W. Hewer by coach to Worcester House, where I light, sending him home with the 100l. that I received today.

1660-08-20 12:00 r So I went as far as Worcester House, but my Lord Chancellor being gone to the House of Lords, I went thither, and (there being a law case before them this day) got in, and there staid all the morning, seeing their manner of sitting on woolpacks, &c., which I never did before.

1660-08-20 09:00   As Sir W. Pen and I were walking in the garden, a messenger came to me from the Duke of York to fetch me to the Lord Chancellor.


1660-08-19 22:10   My wife and I went and walked in the garden, and so home to bed.

1660-08-19 16:40   I went up to put my papers in order, and finding my wife’s clothes lie carelessly laid up, I was angry with her, which I was troubled for.

1660-08-19 14:40   Mr. Creed and my brother Tom dined with me. After dinner my wife went and fetched the little puppies to us, which are very pretty ones.

1660-08-19 13:30   Home to dinner, where my wife had on her new petticoat that she bought yesterday, which indeed is a very fine cloth and a fine lace; but that being of a light colour, and the lace all silver, it makes no great show.

1660-08-19 11:20   Sir W. Batten, Pen, and myself, went to church to the churchwardens, to demand a pew, which at present could not be given us, but we are resolved to have one built. So we staid and heard Mr. Mills, a very, good minister.

1660-08-19 07:50 r My wife tells me that the bitch has whelped four young ones and is very well after it, my wife having had a great fear that she would die thereof, the dog that got them being very big.


1660-08-18 22:40   Home by coach, and after being trimmed, leaving my wife to look after her little bitch, which was just now a-whelping, I to bed.

1660-08-18 17:20 r One Kinaston, a boy, acted the Duke’s sister, but made the loveliest lady that ever I saw in my life, only her voice not very good. We three went to drink, and by Captain Ferrers’ means, Kinaston and another that acted Archas, the General, came and drank with us.

1660-08-18 15:20 r Captain Ferrers, my Lord’s Cornet, comes to us, who after dinner took me and Creed to the Cockpitt play, the first that I have had time to see since my coming from sea, “The Loyall Subject.”

1660-08-18 13:10   I and Creed and Captain Hayward (who is now unkindly put out of the Plymouth to make way for Captain Allen to go to Constantinople, and put into his ship the Dover, which I know will trouble my Lord) went and dined at the Leg in King Street.

1660-08-18 10:20 r By and by comes my wife to tell me that my father has persuaded her to buy a most fine cloth of 26s. a yard, and a rich lace, that the petticoat will come to 5l., at which I was somewhat troubled, but she doing it very innocently, I could not be angry.

1660-08-18 09:30   I took my wife towards Westminster by water, and landed her at Whitefriars, with 5l. to buy her a petticoat, and I to the Privy Seal.


1660-08-17 21:20 r This night I saw Mr. Creed show many the strangest evasions to shift off his drink I ever saw in my life.

1660-08-17 20:30   I and Creed and the judge-Advocate went to Mr. Pim, the tailor’s, who took us to the Half Moon, and there did give us great store of wine and anchovies, and would pay for them all.

1660-08-17 13:50   Home to dinner where Mr. Unthanke, my wife’s tailor, dined with us, we having nothing but a dish of sheep’s trotters.


1660-08-16 14:30   I met with Mr. Madge, who took me along with him and Captain Cooke (the famous singer) and other masters of music to dinner at an ordinary about Charing Cross where we dined, all paying their club.

1660-08-16 07:15 r My Lord in the way talking how good he did hope my place would be to me, and in general speaking that it was not the salary of any place that did make a man rich, but the opportunity of getting money while he is in the place.

1660-08-16 07:10   My Lord (all things being ready) carried me by coach to Mr. Crew’s, where he took leave, and went into the coach, and so for Hinchinbroke.

1660-08-16 06:55 r Here I lay all night in the old chamber which I had now given up to W. Howe, with whom I did intend to lie, but he and I fell to play with one another, so that I made him to go lie with Mr. Sheply. So I lay alone all night.


1660-08-15 21:20   To my Lord’s, where I found him within, and he did give me direction about his business in his absence, he intending to go into the country tomorrow morning.

1660-08-15 20:30   To Westminster Hall, where I staid at Mrs. Michell’s, and with her and her husband sent for some drink, and drank with them. By the same token she and Mrs. Murford and another old woman of the Hall were going a gossiping tonight.

1660-08-15 14:10   To White Hall, where I found the King gone this morning by 5 of the clock to see a Dutch pleasure-boat below bridge, where he dines, and my Lord with him. The King do tire all his people that are about him with early rising since he came.


1660-08-14 22:10   Home with my wife by water, where I made good sport with having the girl and the boy to comb my head, before I went to bed, in the kitchen.

1660-08-14 14:45 r I did also make even with Mr. Fairbrother for my degree of Master of Arts, which cost me about 9l. 16s.

1660-08-14 14:30 r My father, after dinner, takes leave, after I had given him 40s. for the last half year for my brother John at Cambridge.

1660-08-14 14:00 r In comes young Captain Cuttance of the Speedwell, who is sent up for the gratuity given the seamen that brought the King over. He brought me a firkin of butter for my wife, which is very welcome.

1660-08-14 13:40   Home by water to the Tower, where my father, Mr. Fairbrother, and Cooke dined with me.

1660-08-14 10:20   To the Privy Seal, and thence to my Lord’s, where Mr. Pim, the tailor, and I agreed upon making me a velvet coat.


1660-08-13 21:50   Home by coach, and took my 100l. that I had formerly left at Mr. Rawlinson’s, home with me, which is the first that ever I was master of at once. To prayers, and to bed.

1660-08-13 21:10 r My father home, and I to my Lord’s; where he told me that he would suddenly go into the country, and so did commend the business of his sea commission to me in his absence.

1660-08-13 20:30 r My father and Creed and I to the old Rhenish Winehouse, and talked and drank till night.

1660-08-13 14:55   To the Privy Seal, whither my father came to me, and staid talking with me a great while, telling me that he had propounded Mr. John Pickering for Sir Thomas Honywood’s daughter, which I think he do not deserve for his own merit: I know not what he may do for his estate.

1660-08-13 09:10   A sitting day at our office.


1660-08-12 20:40   I called in at Mr. Rawlinson’s, whither my uncle Wight was coming and did come, but was exceeding angry (he being a little fuddled, and I think it was that I should see him in that case) as I never saw him in my life, which I was somewhat troubled at.

1660-08-12 17:40 r I took her to my house, where I was exceeding free in dallying with her, and she not unfree to take it.

1660-08-12 16:00 r I went to walk, and meeting Mrs. Lane of Westminster Hall, I took her to my Lord’s, and did give her a bottle of wine in the garden, where Mr. Fairbrother, of Cambridge, did come and found us, and drank with us.

1660-08-12 13:10 r My Lord dined at my Lord Chamberlain’s, and I at his house with Mr. Sheply. After dinner I did give Mr. Donne; who is going to sea, the key of my cabin and direction for the putting up of my things.

1660-08-12 11:50 r After sermon a brave anthem of Captain Cooke’s, which he himself sung, and the King was well pleased with it.

1660-08-12 11:30   To my Lord, and with him to White Hall Chappell, where Mr. Calamy preached, and made a good sermon upon these words “To whom much is given, of him much is required.” He was very officious with his three reverences to the King, as others do.


1660-08-11 22:20   I was vexed that W. Hewer was out of doors till ten at night but was satisfied again when my wife told me that he wept because I was angry, though he did give me a good reason for his being out; but I thought it a good occasion to let him know that I do expect his being at home.

1660-08-11 20:20   Home, and then sent for the barber, and was trimmed in the kitchen, the first time that ever I was so.

1660-08-11 09:50   Going to my own house in Axeyard, I went in to Mrs. Crisp’s, where I met with Mr. Hartlibb; for whom I wrote a letter for my Lord to sign for a ship for his brother and sister, who went away hence this day to Gravesend, and from thence to Holland.

1660-08-11 07:00   I rose today without any pain, which makes me think that my pain yesterday was nothing but from my drinking too much the day before.


1660-08-10 20:45 r Never since I was a man in the world was I ever so great a stranger to public affairs as now I am, having not read a new book or anything like it, or enquiring after any news, or what the Parliament do, or in any wise how things go.

1660-08-10 20:35 r But blessed be God for my good chance of the Privy Seal, where I get every day I believe about 3l.. This place I got by chance, and my Lord did give it me by chance, neither he nor I thinking it to be of the worth that he and I find it to be.

1660-08-10 20:30   For this month or two it is not imaginable how busy my head has been, so that I have neglected to write letters to my uncle Robert in answer to many of his, and to other friends, nor indeed have I done anything as to my own family.

1660-08-10 18:00   I went to my Lord’s, and took Will (who waited for me there) by coach and went home, taking my lute home with me. It had been all this while since I came from sea at my Lord’s for him to play on.

1660-08-10 16:45 r Crow beat the other by above two miles.

1660-08-10 16:35 r By the way I cannot forget that my Lord Claypoole did the other day make enquiry of Mrs. Hunt, concerning my House in Axe-yard, and did set her on work to get it of me for him, which methinks is a very great change.

1660-08-10 16:30   After dinner with great pain in my back I went by water to Whitehall to the Privy Seal, and that done with Mr. Moore and Creed to Hide Park by coach, and saw a fine foot-race three times round the Park between an Irishman and Crow, that was once my Lord Claypoole’s footman.

1660-08-10 06:40   I had a great deal of pain all night, and a great loosing upon me so that I could not sleep. I rose with much pain and to the office.


1660-08-09 21:30 r I, having my head full of drink from having drunk so much Rhenish wine in the morning, and more in the afternoon at Mrs. Blackburne’s, came home and so to bed, not well.

1660-08-09 18:10 r I to the Privy Seal, where I despatch some business, and from thence to Mrs. Blackburne again, who did treat my wife and me with a great deal of civility, and did give us a fine collation of collar of beef, &c.

1660-08-09 14:20 r To my office of Privy Seal, and, having signed some things there, with Mr. Moore and Dean Fuller to the Leg in King Street, and, sending for my wife, we dined there very merry, and after dinner, parted.

1660-08-09 10:00 r We were very merry, and judge Advocate did give Captain Hayward his Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy.

1660-08-09 09:10   I to my Lord’s, and from thence with judge Advocate Fowler, Mr. Creed, and Mr. Sheply to the Rhenish Wine-house, and Captain Hayward of the Plymouth, who is now ordered to carry my Lord Winchelsea, Embassador to Constantinople.

1660-08-09 07:00   We lay there all night very pleasantly, I taking my pleasure with my wife in the morning, the first time after her being eased of her pain.


1660-08-08 21:55 r After I had done some business with my Lord, she and I went to Mrs. Hunt’s, who would needs have us to lie at her house tonight, she being with my wife so late at my Lord’s with us, and would not let us go home tonight.

1660-08-08 20:30 r From the Privy Seal, Mr. Woodson and Mr. Jennings and I to the Sun Tavern till it was late, and from thence to my Lord’s, where my wife was come from Mrs. Blackburne’s to me.

1660-08-08 16:10 r To Mr. Butler’s to see his daughters, the first time that ever we made a visit to them. We found them very pretty, and Coll. Dillon there, a very merry and witty companion, but methinks they live in a gaudy but very poor condition.

1660-08-08 14:10   With my wife by water to Catan Sterpin, with whom and her mistress Pye we sat discoursing of Kate’s marriage to Mons. Petit, her mistress and I giving the best advice we could for her to suspend her marriage till Mons. Petit had got some place that may be able to maintain her.

1660-08-08 00:15 r We went to the Bullhead, where he and I sat and drank till 11 at night, and so home on foot. Found my wife pretty well again, and so to bed.


1660-08-07 21:20 r Here I endeavoured to have looked out Jane that formerly lived at Dr. Williams’ at Cambridge, whom I had long thought to live at present here, but I found myself in an error, meeting one in the place where I expected to have found her but she proved not she though very like her.

1660-08-07 20:50 r He staying long I left the coach and walked back again before on foot (a very pleasant walk) to Kensington, where I drank and staid very long waiting for him. At last he came, and after drinking at the inn we went towards Westminster.

1660-08-07 18:40 r Meeting Sam. Hartlibb, he took me by coach to Kensington, to my Lord of Holland’s; I staid in the coach while he went in about his business.

1660-08-07 13:30   Dined at my Lord’s with Mr. Sheply. While I was at dinner in come Sam. Hartlibb and his brother-in-law, now knighted by the King, to request my promise of a ship for them to Holland, which I had promised to get for them.


1660-08-06 23:15   Mr. Man offered me 1000l. for my office of Clerk of the Acts, which made my mouth water; but yet I dare not take it till I speak with my Lord to have his consent.

1660-08-06 23:00   To Whitehall at the Privy Seal all the afternoon, and at night with Mr. Man to Mr. Rawlinson’s in Fenchurch Street.

1660-08-06 13:40   This morning at the office, and, that being done, home to dinner all alone, my wife being ill in pain a-bed, which I was troubled at, and not a little impatient.


1660-08-05 20:50 r I got a Gravesend boat, that was come up to fetch some bread on this side the bridge, and got them to carry me to the bridge, and so home, where I found my wife.

1660-08-05 20:00   To Westminster stairs, where I saw a fray between Mynheer Clinke, a Dutchman, that was at Hartlibb’s wedding, and a waterman, which made good sport.

1660-08-05 18:20 r Church done I went and Mr. Sheply to see W. Howe at Mr. Pierces, where I staid singing of songs and psalms an hour or two, and were very pleasant with Mrs. Pierce and him.

1660-08-05 15:30   After dinner to St. Margaret’s, where the first time I ever heard Common Prayer in that Church. I sat with Mr. Hill in his pew; Mr. Hill that married in Axe Yard and that was aboard us in the Hope.

1660-08-05 10:10   My wife being much in pain, I went to Dr. Williams (who had cured her once before of this business), in Holborn, and he did give me an ointment which I sent home by my boy, and a plaister.

1660-08-05 06:00   Before I was up Will came home pretty well again, he having been only weary with riding, which he is not used to.


1660-08-04 22:25   Mrs. Shaw did die yesterday and her husband so sick that he is not like to live.

1660-08-04 22:20   I found my wife still in pain. To bed, having not time to write letters, and indeed having so many to write to all places that I have no heart to go about them.

1660-08-04 21:50   I made haste home, and in the courtyard, it being very dark, I heard a man inquire for my house. He told me that my man William (who went this morning — out of town to meet his aunt Blackburne) was come home not very well to his mother, and so could not come home tonight.

1660-08-04 21:20   It being very rainy, and it thundering and lightning exceedingly, I took coach at the Trumpet door, taking Monsieur L’Impertinent as far as the Savoy, where he said he went to lie with Cary Dillon, and is still upon the mind of going (he and his whole family) to Ireland.

1660-08-04 18:20   I went and bespoke some linen of Betty Lane in the Hall, and after that to the Trumpet, where I sat and talked with her, &c.

1660-08-04 14:30   To a Committee of Parliament (Sir Hen. Finch, Chairman), to give them an answer to an order of theirs, “that we could not give them any account of the Accounts of the Navy in the years 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, as they desire.”


1660-08-03 17:10 r I was at the Privy Seal Office all day, signing things and taking money, so that I could not do as I had intended, that is to return to them and go to the Red Bull Playhouse, but I took coach and went to see whether it was done so or no, and I found it done.

1660-08-03 14:00   My wife and I by coach to Dr. Clerke’s to dinner: I was very much taken with his lady, a comely, proper woman, though not handsome; but a woman of the best language I ever heard.

1660-08-03 10:45   Up betimes this morning, and after the barber had done with me, then to the office, where I and Sir William Pen only did meet and despatch business.


1660-08-02 20:10   I cast up the expense that I laid out upon my former house (because there are so many that are desirous of it and I am loth to let it go out of my hands). I find my layings-out to come to about 20l, which with my fine will come to about 22l. to him that shall hire my house of me.

1660-08-02 19:00   When I came home I found my wife not very well of her old pain in the lip of her chose, which she had when we were married first.

1660-08-02 18:40 r So great is the present profit of this office, above what it was in the King’s time; there being the last month about 300 bills; whereas in the late King’s time it was much to have 40. With my money home by coach.

1660-08-02 17:50   W. Hewer and I to the office of Privy Seal, where I stayed, and received about 40l. for yesterday and today, at which my heart rejoiced for God’s blessing to me, to give me this advantage by chance, there being of this 40l. about 10l. due to me for this day’s work.

1660-08-02 13:40   Dined with Mr. Blackburne at his house with his friends (his wife being in the country and just upon her return to London), where we were very well treated and merry.

1660-08-02 11:40   To Westminster with Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen to the Admiralty; and from thence I went to my Lord’s to fetch him thither, where we stayed in the morning about ordering of money for the victuallers, and advising how to get a sum of money to carry on the business of the Navy.


1660-08-01 21:20 r In Fish Street bought a Lobster, and as I had bought it I met with Winter and Mr. Delabarr, and there with a piece of sturgeon of theirs we went to the Sun Tavern in the street and ate them.

1660-08-01 19:45   After I had signed all, I went with Dick Scobell and Luellin to drink at a bottle beer house in the Strand, and after staying there a while (had sent W. Hewer home before), I took boat and homewards went.

1660-08-01 16:04   At the office again, where we had many things to sign; and I went to the Council Chamber, and there got my Lord to sign the first bill, and the rest all myself; but received no money today.

1660-08-01 12:55   I took Mr. Harper to the Leg in King Street, and did give him his dinner, who did still advise me much to act wholly myself at the Privy Seal, but I told him that I could not, because I had other business to take up my time.

1660-08-01 07:40 r To the Privy Seal Office, where I got (by Mr. Mathews’ means) possession of the books and table, but with some expectation of Baron’s bringing of a warrant from the King to have this month.

1660-08-01 06:30   Up very early, and by water to Whitehall to my Lord’s, and there up to my Lord’s lodging (Wm. Howe being now ill of the gout at Mr. Pierce’s), and there talked with him about the affairs of the Navy, and how I was now to wait today at the Privy Seal.
