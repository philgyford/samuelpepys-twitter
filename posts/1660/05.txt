1660-05-31 21:40   I expect every minute to hear how my poor wife do. I find myself in all things well as to body and mind, but troubled for the absence of my wife.

1660-05-31 21:10   This day the month ends, I in very good health, and all the world in a merry mood because of the King’s coming.

1660-05-31 18:30   My pain was gone again that I had yesterday, blessed be God.

1660-05-31 16:40   Captain Sparling of the Assistance brought me a pair of silk stockings of a light blue, which I was much pleased with.

1660-05-31 15:10   A great while below in the great cabin trying with W. Howe some of Mr. Laws’ songs, particularly that of “What is a kiss,” with which we had a great deal of pleasure.


1660-05-30 20:40   All yesterday and to-day I had a great deal of pain in making water and in my back, which made me afeard. But it proved nothing but cold, which I took yesterday night.

1660-05-30 19:30   Sir R. Stayner told us how some of his men did grumble that no more of the Duke’s money come to their share and so would not receive any; whereupon he called up those that had taken it, and gives them three shares apiece more, which made good sport among the seamen.

1660-05-30 15:20   Mr. Sheply told me how my Lord had put me down for 70 guilders among the money which was given to my Lord’s servants, which my heart did much rejoice at.

1660-05-30 12:10   All this morning making up my accounts, in which I counted that I had made myself now worth about 80l., at which my heart was glad, and blessed God.

1660-05-30 08:25   The lieutenant came to me to know whether I would eat a dish of mackerel, newly catched, for my breakfast, which the Captain and we did in the coach.


1660-05-29 22:10   The pain that I have got last night by cold is not yet gone, but troubles me at the time of pissing.

1660-05-29 19:30   This day, it is thought, the King do enter the city of London.

1660-05-29 16:15 r While we were on the top of the cliffe, we saw and heard our guns in the fleet go off for the same joy. And it being a pretty fair day we could see above twenty miles into France.

1660-05-29 16:00 r Toward the barge again, and in our way found the people at Deal going to make a bonfire for joy of the day, it being the King’s birthday, and had some guns which they did fire at my Lord’s coming by. For which I did give twenty shillings among them to drink.

1660-05-29 15:45 r But we riding under it, my Lord made a pretty good measure of it with two sticks, and found it to be not above thirty-five yards high, and Paul’s is reckoned to be about ninety.

1660-05-29 15:40 r We came upon a very high cliff by the sea-side, and rode under it, we having laid great wagers, I and D. Mathews, that it was not so high as Paul’s; my Lord and Mr. Hetly, that it was.

1660-05-29 15:20 r Among other things my Lord showed me a house that cost a great deal of money, and is built in so barren and inconvenient a place that my Lord calls it the fool’s house.

1660-05-29 15:00 r On shore we took horses, my Lord and Mr. Edward, Mr. Hetly and I, and three or four servants, and had a great deal of pleasure in riding.

1660-05-29 13:20   After dinner got all ready and sent away Mr. Cook to London with a letter and token to my wife.

1660-05-29 06:30   I had a strange dream of bepissing myself, which I really did, and having kicked my clothes off, I got cold; and found myself all much wet in the morning, and had a great deal of pain in making water which made me very melancholy.


1660-05-28 16:40   A great part of the afternoon at nine-pins with my Lord and Mr. Hetley. I lost about 4s.

1660-05-28 08:00   The Captain did call over all the men in the ship (not the boys), and give every one of them a ducat of the King’s money that he gave the ship, and the officers according to their quality. I received in the Captain’s cabin, for my share, sixty ducats.

1660-05-28 05:10   Called up at two in the morning for letters for my Lord from the Duke of York, but I went to bed again till 5.


1660-05-27 13:30   The officers being all on board, there was not room for me at table, so I dined in my cabin, where, among other things, Mr. Drum brought me a lobster and a bottle of oil, instead of a bottle of vinegar, whereby I spoiled my dinner.

1660-05-27 11:10   My Lord and the ship’s company down to sermon. I staid above to write and look over my new song book, which came last night to me from London in lieu of that that my Lord had of me.

1660-05-27 10:00   Mr. Thos. Crew and Mr. J. Pickering (who had staid long enough to make all the world see him to be a fool), took ship for London.

1660-05-27 08:15 r So the herald putting the ribbon about his neck, and the Garter about his left leg, he salutes him with joy as Knight of the Garter, and that was all.

1660-05-27 08:12 r And that whereas my Lord is of a noble family, and hath now done the King such service by sea, at this time, as he hath done; he do send him this George and Garter to wear as Knight of the Order.

1660-05-27 08:10 r The contents of the letter is to show that the Kings of England have for many years made use of this honour, as a special mark of favour, to persons of good extraction and virtue (and that many Emperors, Kings and Princes of other countries have borne this honour)

1660-05-27 08:00 r My Lord hath summoned all the Commanders on board him, to see the ceremony.

1660-05-27 07:10   Called up by John Goods to see the Garter and Heralds coat, which lay in the coach, brought by Sir Edward Walker, King at Arms, this morning, for my Lord.


1660-05-26 21:20   The Captain told me that my Lord had appointed me 30l. out of the 1000 ducats which the King had given to the ship, at which my heart was very much joyed. To bed.

1660-05-26 19:40   My Lord having been a-shore, the first time that he hath been a-shore since he came out of the Hope (having resolved not to go till he had brought his Majesty into England), returned on board with a great deal of pleasure.

1660-05-26 17:30   Mr. North and Dr. Clerke and all the great company being gone, I found myself very uncouth all this day for want thereof.

1660-05-26 17:10   After a game or two at nine-pins, to work all the afternoon, making above twenty orders.

1660-05-26 13:35   My Lord dined with the Vice-Admiral today (who is as officious, poor man! as any spaniel can be; but I believe all to no purpose, for I believe he will not hold his place).

1660-05-26 09:10   Thanks to God I got to bed in my own poor cabin, and slept well till 9 o’clock this morning.


1660-05-25 19:30 r My Lord did give me order to cause the marke to be gilded, and a Crown and C. R. to be made at the head of the coach table, where the King today with his own hand did mark his height, which accordingly I caused the painter to do, and is now done as is to be seen.

1660-05-25 15:50 r My Lord almost transported with joy that he had done all this without any the least blur or obstruction in the world, that could give an offence to any, and with the great honour he thought it would be to him.

1660-05-25 15:30 r The shouting and joy expressed by all is past imagination.

1660-05-25 15:15 r  A canopy was provided for him to stand under, which he did, and talked awhile with General Monk and others, and so into a stately coach there set for him, and so away through the town towards Canterbury, without making any stay at Dover.

1660-05-25 14:40 r The Mayor of the town came and gave the King his white staff, the badge of his place, which the King did give him again. The Mayor also presented him from the town a very rich Bible, which he took and said it was the thing that he loved above all things in the world.

1660-05-25 14:10 r In a boat by ourselves, and so got on shore when the King did, who was received by General Monk with all imaginable love and respect at his entrance upon the land of Dover. Infinite the crowd of people and the horsemen, citizens, and noblemen of all sorts.

1660-05-25 09:40 r Great expectation of the King’s making some Knights, but there was none.

1660-05-25 09:20 r I spoke with the Duke of York about business, who called me Pepys by name, and upon my desire did promise me his future favour.

1660-05-25 08:10   The King and the two Dukes did eat their breakfast before they went, and there being set some ship’s diet before them, only to show them the manner of the ship’s diet, they eat of nothing else but pease and pork, and boiled beef.

1660-05-25 07:00   By the morning we were come close to the land, and every body made ready to get on shore.


1660-05-24 22:10   To bed, coming in sight of land a little before night.

1660-05-24 19:50   I put Dr. Scarborough in mind of what I heard him say about the use of the eyes, that children do, in every day’s experience, look several ways with both their eyes, till custom teaches them otherwise. And that we do now see but with one eye, our eyes looking in parallel lines.

1660-05-24 16:50   Walking upon the decks, where persons of honour all the afternoon, among others, Thomas Killigrew (a merry droll, but a gentleman of great esteem with the King), who told us many merry stories.

1660-05-24 13:40   There dined with me in my cabin (that is, the carpenter’s) Dr. Earle and Mr. Hollis, the King’s Chaplins, Dr. Scarborough, Dr. Quarterman, and Dr. Clerke, Physicians, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Fox (both very fine gentlemen), the King’s servants, where we had brave discourse.

1660-05-24 06:50   Up, and made myself as fine as I could, with the Linning stockings on and wide canons that I bought the other day at Hague.


1660-05-23 21:50 r To my cabin, where the company still was, and were talking more of the King’s difficulties; as how he was fain to eat a piece of bread and cheese out of a poor boy’s pocket; how, at a Catholique house, he was fain to lie in the priest’s hole in the house for his privacy.

1660-05-23 17:50 r At Rouen he looked so poorly, that the people went into the rooms before he went away to see whether he had not stole something or other.

1660-05-23 17:40 r Then the difficulty of getting a boat to get into France, where he was fain to plot with the master thereof to keep his design from the four men and a boy (which was all his ship’s company), and so got to Fecamp in France.

1660-05-23 17:33 r Every step up to his knees in dirt with nothing but a green coat and a pair of country breeches on, and a pair of country shoes that made him so sore all over his feet, that he could scarce stir. He was forced to run away from a miller and other company that took them for rogues.

1660-05-23 17:30 r Upon the quarterdeck he fell into discourse of his escape from Worcester, where it made me ready to weep to hear the stories that he told of his difficulties that he had passed through, as his travelling four days and three nights on foot.

1660-05-23 17:10 r We weighed anchor, and with a fresh gale and most happy weather we set sail for England. All the afternoon the King walked here and there, up and down (quite contrary to what I thought him to have been), very active and stirring.

1660-05-23 14:50 r That done, the Queen, Princess Royal, and Prince of Orange, took leave of the King, and the Duke of York went on board the London, and the Duke of Gloucester, the Swiftsure.

1660-05-23 14:30 r The King and Duke altered the name of some of the ships, viz. the Nazeby into Charles; the Richard, James; the Speaker, Mary; the Dunbar, the Henry; Winsly, Happy Return; Wakefield, Richmond; Lambert; the Henrietta; Cheriton, the Speedwell; Bradford, the Success.

1660-05-23 13:10 r Dined in a great deal of state, the Royall company by themselves in the coach, which was a blessed sight to see. I dined with Dr. Clerke, Dr. Quarterman, and Mr. Darcy in my cabin.

1660-05-23 10:20 r Infinite shooting off of the guns, and that in a disorder on purpose, which was better than if it had been otherwise.

1660-05-23 10:05 r The King, with the two Dukes and Queen of Bohemia, Princess Royal, and Prince of Orange, came on board, where I in their coming in kissed the King’s, Queen’s, and Princess’s hands, having done the other before.

1660-05-23 09:50   My Lord, Mr. Crew, and others, go on shore to meet the King as he comes off from shore, where Sir R. Stayner bringing His Majesty into the boat, I hear that His Majesty did with a great deal of affection kiss my Lord upon his first meeting.

1660-05-23 07:10   The Doctor and I waked very merry, only my eye was very red and ill in the morning from yesterday’s hurt.


1660-05-22 18:40 r We began to remove cabins; I to the carpenter’s cabin, and Dr. Clerke with me, who came on board this afternoon, having been twice ducked in the sea to-day coming from shore, and Mr. North and John Pickering the like.

1660-05-22 16:20 r Mr. Downing (who was knighted yesterday by the King) was here on board, and had a ship for his passage into England, with his lady and servants. By the same token he called me to him when I was going to write the order, to tell me that I must write him Sir G. Downing.

1660-05-22 15:33 r The gun over against my cabin I fired myself to the King, which was the first time that he had been saluted by his own ships since this change; but holding my head too much over the gun, I had almost spoiled my right eye.

1660-05-22 15:30 r By the time we came on board again, news is sent us that the King is on shore; so my Lord fired all his guns round twice, and all the fleet after him, which in the end fell into disorder, which seemed very handsome.

1660-05-22 14:10 r They made to the shore in the Dutch boat that brought them, and I got into the boat with them; but the shore was so full of people to expect their coming, as that it was as black (which otherwise is white sand), as every one could stand by another.

1660-05-22 13:00 r Two guns given to every man while he was drinking the King’s health, and so likewise to the Duke’s health.

1660-05-22 12:10 r Upon the quarter-deck table, under the awning, the Duke of York and my Lord, Mr. Coventry, and I, spent an hour at allotting to every ship their service, in their return to England; which having done, they went to dinner, where the table was very full.

1660-05-22 08:45 r My Lord went in a boat to meet them, the Captain, myself, and others, standing at the entering port. So soon as they were entered we shot the guns off round the fleet. After that they went to view the ship all over, and were most exceedingly pleased with it.

1660-05-22 08:30   News brought that the two Dukes are coming on board, which, by and by, they did, in a Dutch boats the Duke of York in yellow trimmings, the Duke of Gloucester in grey and red.

1660-05-22 05:30   Up very early, and now beginning to be settled in my wits again, I went about setting down my last four days’ observations this morning. After that, was trimmed by a barber that has not trimmed me yet, my Spaniard being on shore.


1660-05-21 20:10   We expect every day to have the King and Duke on board as soon as it is fair. My Lord do nothing now, but offers all things to the pleasure of the Duke as Lord High Admiral. So that I am at a loss what to do.

1660-05-21 19:20 r The old clergy talk as being sure of their lands again, and laugh at the Presbytery; and it is believed that the sales of the King’s and Bishops’ lands will never be confirmed by Parliament.

1660-05-21 19:10   By letters that came hither in my absence, I understand that the Parliament had ordered all persons to be secured, in order to a trial, that did sit as judges in the late King’s death, and all the officers too attending the Court.

1660-05-21 17:30   After dinner, about writing one thing or other all day, and setting my papers in order, having been so long absent.

1660-05-21 09:10 r So into my naked bed and slept till 9 o’clock, and then John Goods waked me, and by the captain’s boy brought me four barrels of Mallows oysters, which Captain Tatnell had sent me from Murlace.

1660-05-21 04:03   I lay down in my gown upon my bed and slept till the 4 o’clock gun the next morning waked me, which I took for 8 at night, and rising to piss mistook the sun rising for the sun setting on Sunday night.


1660-05-20 14:10 r But through badness of weather we were in great danger, and a great while before we could get to the ship, so that of all the company not one but myself that was not sick. I keeping myself in the open air, though I was soundly wet for it.

1660-05-20 12:20   Commissioner Pett at last came to our lodging, and caused the boats to go off; so some in one boat and some in another we all bid adieu to the shore.

1660-05-20 08:10   I went into the church at Scheveling, which was pretty handsome, and in the chancel a very great upper part of the mouth of a whale, which indeed was of a prodigious bigness, bigger than one of our long boats that belong to one of our ships.

1660-05-20 07:40 r At last she rose, and then I rose, and saw her dress herself after the Dutch dress, and talked to her as much as I could, and took occasion, from her ring which she wore on her first finger, to kiss her hand, but had not the face to offer anything more.

1660-05-20 06:00 r I went to lie down in a chamber in the house, where in another bed there was a pretty Dutch woman in bed alone, but though I had a month’s-mind I had not the boldness to go to her.

1660-05-20 05:20   With Mr. Pickering and the child by waggon to Scheveling.

1660-05-20 00:20 r Going to my lodging we met with the bellman, who struck upon a clapper, which I took in my hand, and it is just like the clapper that our boys frighten the birds away from the corn with in summer time in England. To bed.


1660-05-19 20:10 r I met my old chamber-fellow, Mr. Ch. Anderson, and a friend of his, Mr. Wright, who took me to a Dutch house, where there was an exceeding pretty lass, and right for the sport, but it being Saturday we could not have much of her company, but however I staid with them.

1660-05-19 17:20 r From thence to the Hague again playing at crambo in the waggon, Mr. Edward, Mr. Ibbott, W. Howe, Mr. Pinkney, and I.

1660-05-19 16:40 r We went into a little drinking house where there were a great many Dutch boors eating of fish in a boorish manner, but very merry in their way. But the houses here as neat as in the great places.

1660-05-19 11:10 r By waggon to Lausdune where the 365 children were born. We saw the hill where the house stood and sunk wherein the children were born. The basins wherein the children were baptized do stand over a table that hangs upon a wall with the whole story of the thing in Dutch and Latin.

1660-05-19 10:00 r We saw Mr. Edward and his company land. Who told me that they had been at Leyden all night, at which I was very angry with Mr. Pierce, and shall not be friends I believe a good while.

1660-05-19 09:50 r Another pretty piece of painting I saw, on which there was a great wager laid by young Pinkney and me whether it was a principal or a copy. But not knowing how to decide, it was broken off.

1660-05-19 09:30 r We went to buy some pictures, where I saw a sort of painting done upon woollen cloth, drawn as if there was a curtain over it, which was very pleasant, but dear.

1660-05-19 08:10 r Back to the Hague, in our way lighting and going to see a woman that makes pretty rock-work in shells, &c., which could I have carried safe I would have bought some of.

1660-05-19 07:50   Hearing nothing of the child, and went to Scheveling, where I found no getting on board, though the Duke of York sent every day to see whether he could do it or no.


1660-05-18 22:10 r Back to the Hague. Among other mirth Mr. Ackworth vyed wives, each endeavouring to set his own wife out to the best advantage, he having as they said an extraordinary handsome wife. But Mr. Dawes could not be got to say anything of his.

1660-05-18 16:20 r My pleasure was increased by seeing of it again. Besides we went into the garden, wherein are gallant nuts better than ever I saw, and a fine Echo under the house in a vault made on purpose with pillars, where I played on my flageolette to great advantage.

1660-05-18 15:00 r I went along with Commissioner Pett, Mr. Ackworth and Mr. Dawes his friends, to the Princess Dowager’s house again.

1660-05-18 14:00 r Back by water, where a pretty sober Dutch lass sat reading all the way, and I could not fasten any discourse upon her.

1660-05-18 12:30 r We light of an English house to drink in, where we were merry, discoursing of the town and the thing that hangs up in the Stadthouse like a bushel, which is a punishment for some sort of offenders to carry through the streets of the town over his head, which is a great weight.

1660-05-18 11:40 r We also saw the Guesthouse, where it was very pleasant to see what neat preparation there is for the poor. We saw one poor man a-dying there.

1660-05-18 10:50 r Here were very fine organs in both the churches. It is a most sweet town, with bridges, and a river in every street.

1660-05-18 10:20 r To the great church, that stands in a fine great market-place, over against the Stadt-house, and there I saw a stately tomb of the old Prince of Orange, of marble and brass; wherein among other rarities there are the angels with their trumpets expressed as it were crying.

1660-05-18 09:00 r We got a smith’s boy of the town to go along with us, but could speak nothing but Dutch, and he showed us the church where Van Trump lies entombed with a very fine monument. There is a sea-fight cut in marble, with the smoke, the best expressed that ever I saw in my life.

1660-05-18 08:10 r So we all and Mr. Ibbott, the Minister, took a schuit and very much pleased with the manner and conversation of the passengers, where most speak French; went after them, but met them by the way.

1660-05-18 06:40 r But the wind being very high that no boats could get off from shore, we returned to the Hague, where I hear that the child is gone to Delfe to see the town.

1660-05-18 05:30   Hearing that the Duke of York, our Lord High Admiral, would go on board today, Mr. Pickering and I took waggon for Scheveling, leaving the child in Mr. Pierces hands, with directions to keep him within doors all day till he heard from me.


1660-05-17 22:33 r So we returned in the dark with a wagon with one horse to the Hague, where being come we went to bed as well as we could be accommodated, and so to sleep.

1660-05-17 21:55 r We took wagon to Scheveling, where we had a fray with the Boatswain of the Richmond, who would not freely carry us on board, but at last he was willing to it, but then it was so late we durst not go.

1660-05-17 19:45 r Back to the Hague and took a tour or two about the Forehault, where the ladies in the evening do as our ladies do in Hide Park. But for my life I could not find one handsome, but their coaches very rich and themselves so too.

1660-05-17 18:40 r To the Echo, which was very pleasant, and the more because in a heaven of pleasure and in a strange country, that I never was taken up more with a sense of pleasure in my life.

1660-05-17 18:10 r In a coach of a friend’s of Dr. Cade we went to see a house of the Princess Dowager’s in a park about half-a-mile or a mile from the Hague, where there is one, the most beautiful room for pictures in the whole world.

1660-05-17 15:45 r Going to see the Queen of Bohemia, I met with Dr. Fullers whom I sent to a tavern with Mr. Edw. Pickering, while I and the rest went to see the Queen, who used us very respectfully; her hand we all kissed. She seems a very debonaire, but plain lady.

1660-05-17 15:00 r From the King to the Lord Chancellor, who did lie bed-rid of the gout: he spoke very merrily to the child and me.

1660-05-17 14:31 r Then we kissed his, and the Duke of York’s, and the Princess Royal’s hands. The King seems to be a very sober man; and a very splendid Court he hath in the number of persons of quality that are about him, English very rich in habit.

1660-05-17 14:20 r At dinner in came Dr. Cade, a merry mad parson of the King’s. And they two after dinner got the child and me (the others not being able to crowd in) to see the King, who kissed the child very affectionately.

1660-05-17 11:30   Mr. Edw. Pickering and I, W. Howe, Pim, and my boy, to Scheveling, where we took coach, and so to the Hague, where walking, intending to find one that might show us the King incognito, I met with Captain Whittington and he did promise me to do it.

1660-05-17 09:10   Dr. Clerke heard, by some Dutch that are come on board, that there was a Portuguese taken yesterday at the Hague, that had a design to kill the King. But this I heard was only the mistake upon one being observed to walk with his sword naked, he having lost his scabbard.


1660-05-16 20:40   This evening came Mr. John Pickering on board, like an ass, with his feathers and new suit that he had made at the Hague.

1660-05-16 17:10   My Lord and we at ninepins this afternoon upon the Quarterdeck, which was very pretty sport.

1660-05-16 16:50 r Mr. Edwd. Pickering told me in what a sad, poor condition for clothes and money the King was, and all his attendants, when he came to him first from my Lord, their clothes not being worth forty shillings the best of them.

1660-05-16 16:27 r But that he would come to the shore to look upon the fleet today, which we expected, and had our guns ready to fire, and our scarlet waistcloathes out and silk pendants, but he did not come.

1660-05-16 16:25   My Lord in his best suit, this the first day, in expectation to wait upon the King. But Mr. Edw. Pickering coming from the King brought word that the King would not put my Lord to the trouble of coming to him.

1660-05-16 12:20   To dinner, where Commissioner Pett was come to take care to get all things ready for the King on board.

1660-05-16 07:20   I went down to be trimmed below in the great cabin, but then come in some with visits, among the rest one from Admiral Opdam, who spoke Latin well, but not French nor English, to whom my Lord made me to give his answer and to entertain.


1660-05-15 21:20   After supper, my Lord sent for me, intending to have me play at cards with him, but I not knowing cribbage, we fell into discourse of many things, till it was so rough sea and the ship rolled so much that I was not able to stand, and so he bid me go to bed.

1660-05-15 16:20 r Among other things he told me that his conversion to the King’s cause (for so I was saying that I wondered from what time the King could look upon him to become his friend) commenced from his being in the Sound, when he found what usage he was likely to have from a Commonwealth.

1660-05-15 16:00 r My Lord and I walked together, talking together upon all sorts of discourse: as religion, wherein he is, I perceive, wholly sceptical, as well as I, saying, that indeed the Protestants as to the Church of Rome are wholly fanatiques: he likes uniformity and form of prayer.

1660-05-15 15:10   In the afternoon my Lord called me on purpose to show me his fine cloathes which are now come hither, and indeed are very rich as gold and silver can make them, only his sword he and I do not like.

1660-05-15 12:50 r Mr. Morland, now Sir Samuel, was here on board, but I do not find that my Lord or any body did give him any respect, he being looked upon by him and all men as a knave.

1660-05-15 12:30 r Coming on board we found all the Commissioners of the House of Lords at dinner with my Lord, who after dinner went away for shore.

1660-05-15 11:50 r A gentleman that was going to kiss my Lord’s hand, from the Queen of Bohemia, and I hired a Dutch boat for four rixdollars to carry us on board. We were fain to wait a great while before we could get off from the shore, the sea being very rough.

1660-05-15 11:30 r To Scheveling again, where we went into a house of entertainment and drank there, the wind being very high, and we saw two boats overset and the gallants forced to be pulled on shore by the heels, while their trunks, portmanteaus, hats, and feathers, were swimming in the sea.

1660-05-15 09:50 r To a bookseller’s and bought for the love of the binding three books: the French Psalms in four parts, Bacon’s Organon, and Farnab. Rhetor.

1660-05-15 07:45 r To the Grande Salle where we were showed where the States General sit. The hall is a great place, where the flags that they take from their enemies are all hung up; and things to be sold, as in Westminster Hall, and not much unlike it, but that not so big, but much neater.

1660-05-15 06:45 r Every body of fashion speaks French or Latin, or both. The women many of them very pretty and in good habits, fashionable and black spots.

1660-05-15 06:00 r Meeting a schoolmaster that spoke good English and French, he went along with us and showed us the whole town, and indeed I cannot speak enough of the gallantry of the town. He went with me to buy a couple of baskets, one of them for Mrs. Pierce, the other for my wife.

1660-05-15 03:50 r We lay till past three o’clock, then up and down the town, to see it by daylight, where we saw the soldiers of the Prince’s guard, all very fine, and the burghers of the town with their arms and muskets as bright as silver.


1660-05-14 23:50 r  The Judge and I to another house, leaving them there, and he and I lay in one press bed, there being two more in the same room, but all very neat and handsome, my boy sleeping upon a bench by me.

1660-05-14 23:20 r This done we went to a place we had taken to sup in, where a sallet and two or three bones of mutton were provided for a matter of ten of us which was very strange.

1660-05-14 22:05 r The Prince comes home, and we found an easy admission. His attendance very inconsiderable as for a prince; but yet handsome, and his tutor a fine man, and himself a very pretty boy. It was bright moonshine tonight.

1660-05-14 20:00 r We saw a great many places, and were made to understand many things, as the intention of may-poles, which we saw there standing at every great man’s door, of different greatness according to the quality of the person.

1660-05-14 19:40 r But going to see the Prince, he was gone forth with his governor, and so we walked up and down the town and court to see the place; and by the help of a stranger, an Englishman.

1660-05-14 18:40 r Here we walked up and down a great while, the town being now very full of Englishmen, for that the Londoners were come on shore today.

1660-05-14 17:25 r The Hague is a most neat place in all respects. The houses so neat in all places and things as is possible.

1660-05-14 17:10 r I took out my flageolette and piped, but in piping I dropped my rapier-stick, but when I came to the Hague, I sent my boy back again for it and he found it, for which I did give him 6d., but some horses had gone over it and broke the scabbard.

1660-05-14 16:15 r Mr. Creed and I went in the fore part of a coach wherein were two very pretty ladies, very fashionable and with black patches, who very merrily sang all the way and that very well, and were very free to kiss the two blades that were with them.

1660-05-14 16:00 r The weather bad; we were sadly washed when we came near the shore, it being very hard to land there. The shore is, as all the country between that and the Hague, all sand.

1660-05-14 15:10 r They came back again after having kissed the Queen of Bohemia’s hand, and were sent again by my Lord to do the same to the Prince of Orange. So I got the Captain to ask leave for me to go, which my Lord did give, and I taking my boy and judge Advocate with me, went with them.

1660-05-14 12:45 r Mr. North and Dr. Clerke went to kiss the Queen of Bohemia’s hands, from my Lord, with twelve attendants from on board to wait on them, among which I sent my boy, who, like myself, is with child to see any strange thing.

1660-05-14 11:10 r Some gentlemen came on board from the shore to kiss my Lord’s hands.

1660-05-14 10:40 r Some masty Dutchmen came on board to proffer their boats to carry things from us on shore, &c., to get money by us.

1660-05-14 07:10 r My Lord went up in his nightgown into the cuddy, to see how to dispose thereof for himself and us that belong to him, to give order for our removal today.

1660-05-14 06:40   When I woke and rose, I saw myself out of the scuttle close by the shore, which afterwards I was told to be the Dutch shore; the Hague was clearly to be seen by us.


1660-05-13 22:40 r We writ letters to the King of the news of our coming, and Mr. Edward Pickering carried them.

1660-05-13 21:40   We came within sight of Middle’s shore.

1660-05-13 20:20   No sermon all day, we being under sail, only at night prayers, wherein Mr. Ibbott prayed for all that were related to us in a spiritual and fleshly way.

1660-05-13 18:00   Mr. Cook, who came after us in the Yarmouth, bringing me a letter from my wife and a Latin letter from my brother John, with both of which I was exceedingly pleased.

1660-05-13 15:40 r A council of war, only to acquaint them that the Harp must be taken out of all their flags, it being very offensive to the King.

1660-05-13 13:20 r Which after dinner was finished and set up after it had been shown to my Lord, who took physic today and was in his chamber, and liked it so well as to bid me give the tailors 20s. among them for doing of it.

1660-05-13 10:20   To the quarter-deck, upon which the tailors and painters were at work, cutting out some pieces of yellow cloth into the fashion of a crown and C. R. and put it upon a fine sheet, and that into the flag instead of the State’s arms.

1660-05-13 09:30   Trimmed, after that to the cook’s room with Mr. Sheply, the first time that I was there this voyage.


1660-05-12 16:10 r Upon the quarterdeck the Doctor told Mr. North and me an admirable story called “The Fruitless Precaution,” an exceeding pretty story and worthy my getting without book when I can get the book.

1660-05-12 14:30   At cards with Mr. North and the Doctor. There by us, in the Lark frigate, Sir R. Freeman and some others, going from the King to England, come to see my Lord and so onward on their voyage.

1660-05-12 10:20 r Coming in the midway between Dover and Calais, we could see both places very easily, and very pleasant it was to me that the further we went the more we lost sight of both lands.

1660-05-12 08:40 r Sir R. Stayner told my Lord that my Lord Winchelsea understands by letters, that the Commissioners are only to come to Dover to attend the coming over of the King. So my Lord did give order for weighing anchor, which we did, and sailed all day.

1660-05-12 07:10   My Lord gave me many orders to make for direction for the ships that are left in the Downs, giving them the greatest charge in the world to bring no passengers with them, when they come after us to Scheveling Bay, excepting Mr. Edward Montagu, Mr. Thomas Crew, and Sir H. Wright.

1660-05-12 06:30 r I inquired for my boy, whether he was come well or no, and it was told me that he was well in bed.


1660-05-11 23:10   It blew very hard all this night that I was afeard of my boy. About 11 at night came the boats from Deal, with great store of provisions, by the same token John Goods told me that above 20 of the fowls are smothered, but my boy was put on board the Northwich.

1660-05-11 16:20   Overtook us three or four gentlemen; two of the Berties, and one Mr. Dormerhoy, a Scotch gentleman, whom I afterwards found to be a very fine man.

1660-05-11 14:30   We set sail from the Downs, I leaving my boy to go to Deal for my linen.

1660-05-11 13:40   There dined here my Lord Crafford and my Lord Cavendish, and other Scotchmen whom I afterwards ordered to be received on board the Plymouth, and to go along with us.

1660-05-11 12:30   I had my first opportunity of discoursing with Dr. Clarke, whom I found to be a very pretty man and very knowing. He is now going in this ship to the King.

1660-05-11 11:10   We began to pull down all the State’s arms in the fleet, having first sent to Dover for painters and others to come to set up the King’s.

1660-05-11 09:10 r But Burr by and by coming and desiring humbly that I would forgive him and Pitts not coming I did set him to work.

1660-05-11 08:20   Burr going on shore last night made me very angry. So that I sent for Mr. Pitts to come to me from the Vice-Admiral’s, intending not to have employed Burr any more.


1660-05-10 20:30   My Lord called me into his cabin, and told me how he was commanded to set sail presently for the King, and was very glad thereof, and so put me to writing of letters and other work.

1660-05-10 19:10   Comes in a messenger to tell us that Mr. Edward Montagu, my Lord’s son, was come to Deal, who afterwards came on board with Mr. Pickering with him. The child was sick in the evening.

1660-05-10 10:10   Came on board Mr. Pinkney and his son, going to the King with a petition finely writ by Mr. Whore, for to be the King’s embroiderer; for whom and Mr. Saunderson I got a ship.


1660-05-09 15:50   After dinner to ninepins and lost 5s.

1660-05-09 14:20   In comes Noble with a letter from the House of Lords to my Lord. He brought us certain news that the King was proclaimed yesterday with great pomp, and brought down one of the Proclamations, with great joy to us all; for which God be praised.

1660-05-09 11:10   Came Mr. Saunderson, that writ the story of the King, hither, who is going over to the King. He calls me cozen and seems a very knowing man.

1660-05-09 10:30   My Lord and I to write letters to London, which we sent by Mr. Cook, who was very desirous to go because of seeing my wife before she went out of town.

1660-05-09 07:10   Writing a letter to the King, as from the two Generals of the fleet, in answer to his letter to them, wherein my Lord do give most humble thanks for his gracious letter and declaration; and promises all duty and obedience to him.


1660-05-08 22:40   After supper some musique and to bed.

1660-05-08 18:35 r And also the whole story of what we did the other day in the fleet, at reading of the King’s declaration, and my name at the bottom of it.

1660-05-08 18:30   My letters today tell me how it was intended that the King should be proclaimed to-day in London, with a great deal of pomp. I had also news who they are that are chosen of the Lords and Commons to attend the King.

1660-05-08 16:50   My Lord and we at nine-pins: I lost 9s.

1660-05-08 15:50   Mr. Cook brings me word of my wife. He went to Huntsmore to see her, and brought her and my father Bowyer to London, where he left her at my father’s, very well, and speaks very well of her love to me.

1660-05-08 14:30   After dinner come several persons of honour, as my Lord St. John and others, for convoy to Flushing, and great giving of them salutes.

1660-05-08 00:50   After I was in bed Mr. Sheply and W. Howe came and sat in my cabin, where I gave them three bottles of Margate ale, and sat laughing and very merry, and so good night.


1660-05-07 16:30   I lost 5s. at ninepins.

1660-05-07 14:05 r The Vice-Admiral came into the great cabin below, where the Jurates of the town of Dover and I and the commanders for want of room dined, and there told us we must drink a health to the King, and himself called for a bottle of wine, and begun his and the Duke of York’s.

1660-05-07 12:10   Great deal of company come, among others Mr. Bellasses, Sir Thomas Lenthropp, Sir Henry Chichley, Colonel Philip Honiwood, and Captain Titus, the last of whom my Lord showed all our cabins, and I suppose he is to take notice what room there will be for the King’s entertainment.

1660-05-07 11:38   My Lord went about the flag-ships in a boat, to see what alterations there must be, as to the arms and flags. He did give me order also to write for silk flags and scarlett waistcloathes. For a rich barge; for a noise of trumpets, and a set of fidlers.

1660-05-07 10:30   Captain Cuttance sent me 12 bottles of Margate ale. Three of them I drank presently with some friends in the Coach.


1660-05-06 20:10   I looked over my accounts, and find that, all my debts paid and my preparations to sea paid for, I have 40l. clear in my purse.

1660-05-06 17:00   My Lord writ a letter to the King and give it to me to carry privately to Sir William Compton on board the Assistance, which I did, and after a health to his Majesty on board there, I left them under sail for Breda.

1660-05-06 16:30   There was a gentleman with me, an officer of Dunkirk going over, who came to me for an order and told me he was lately with my uncle and Aunt Fenner and that Kate’s fits of the convulsions did hold her still.

1660-05-06 15:10   A stranger preached here, one Mr. Stanley, who prayed for King Charles, by the Grace of God, &c, which gave great contentment to the gentlemen that were on board here, and they said they would talk of it, when they come to Breda, as not having it done yet in London so publickly.

1660-05-06 13:40   I remember that last night upon discourse concerning Clarges my Lord told me that he was a man of small entendimiento.


1660-05-05 19:30   Came Dr. Clarges to Deal, going to the King; where the towns-people strewed the streets with herbes against his coming, for joy of his going. Never was there so general a content as there is now.

1660-05-05 11:30   All the morning very busy writing letters to London, and a packet to Mr. Downing, to acquaint him with what had been done lately in the fleet.


1660-05-04 20:55   Besides the 50,000l. ordered to be borrowed of the City for the present use of the King, the twelve companies of the City do give every one of them to his Majesty, as a present, 1000l.

1660-05-04 20:30   Came a letter from my wife, which tells me that she has not been well, which did exceedingly trouble me, but my Lord sending Mr. Cook at night, I wrote to her and sent a piece of gold enclosed to her, and wrote also to Mrs. Bowyer, and enclosed a half piece to her for a token.

1660-05-04 17:00   The rest of the afternoon at ninepins.

1660-05-04 09:10   I wrote this morning many letters, and to all the copies of the vote of the council of war I put my name, that if it should come in print my name maybe at it.

1660-05-04 03:00   To writing of letters till twelve at night, and so up again at three in the morning. My Lord seemed to put great confidence in me, and would take my advice in many things.


1660-05-03 19:38 r This was very strange to me, that my Lord should carry all things so wisely and prudently as he do, and I was over joyful to see him in so good condition, and he did not a little please himself to tell me how he had provided for himself so great a hold on the King.

1660-05-03 19:31 r The King speaks of his being courted to come to the Hague, but do desire my Lord’s advice whither to come to take ship. And the Duke offers to learn the seaman’s trade of him, in such familiar words as if Jack Cole and I had writ them.

1660-05-03 19:20 r I returned to the Nazeby, where my Lord was much pleased to hear how all the fleet took it in a transport of joy, showed me a private letter of the King’s to him, and another from the Duke of York in such familiar style as to their common friend, with all kindness imaginable.

1660-05-03 18:50 r As I was going on board the Vice-Admiral, the General began to fire his guns, which he did all that he had in the ship, and so did all the rest of the Commanders, which was very gallant, and to hear the bullets go hissing over our heads as we were in the boat.

1660-05-03 16:27 r And much more to see the great joy that I brought to all men; not one through the whole fleet showing the least dislike of the business.

1660-05-03 16:20 r After dinner, to the rest of the ships (staid at the Assistance to hear the harper a good while) quite through the fleet. Which was a very brave sight to visit all the ships, and to be received with the respect and honour that I was on board them all.

1660-05-03 13:10 r I went with Captain Hayward to the Plimouth and Essex, and did what I had to do there and returned, where very merry at dinner.

1660-05-03 11:00 r I went up to the quarter-deck with my Lord and the Commanders, and there read both the papers and the vote; which done, and demanding their opinion, the seamen did all of them cry out, “God bless King Charles!” with the greatest joy imaginable.

1660-05-03 10:22 r Not one man seemed to say no to it, though I am confident many in their hearts were against it.

1660-05-03 10:20 r The Commanders all came on board, and the council sat in the coach (the first council of war that had been in my time), where I read the letter and declaration; and while they were discoursing upon it, I seemed to draw up a vote, which being offered, they passed.

1660-05-03 09:40 r My Lord summoned a council of war, and in the mean time did dictate to me how he would have the vote ordered which he would have pass this council.

1660-05-03 08:40   My Lord showed me the King’s declaration and his letter to the two Generals to be communicated to the fleet. The contents of the letter are his offer of grace to all that will come in within forty days, only excepting them that the Parliament shall hereafter except.


1660-05-02 21:50 r Every body seems to be very joyfull in the business, insomuch that our sea-commanders now begin to say so too, which a week ago they would not do. And our seamen, as many as had money or credit for drink, did do nothing else this evening.

1660-05-02 14:55 r Great joy all yesterday at London, and at night more bonfires than ever, and ringing of bells, and drinking of the King’s health upon their knees in the streets, which methinks is a little too much.

1660-05-02 14:40 r The Commons voted that all books whatever that are out against the Government of King, Lords, and Commons, should be brought into the House and burned.

1660-05-02 14:20 r The City of London have put a Declaration, wherein they do disclaim their owing any other government but that of a King, Lords, and Commons.

1660-05-02 13:56 r The House upon reading the letter, ordered 50,000l. to be provided to send to His Majesty for his present supply; and a committee chosen to return an answer of thanks to His Majesty for his gracious letter; and that the letter be kept among the records of the Parliament.

1660-05-02 13:45 r The King’s letter was read in the House, wherein he submits himself and all things to them, as to an Act of Oblivion to all, unless they shall please to except any, as to the confirming of the sales of the King’s and Church lands, if they see good.

1660-05-02 13:30   Comes Dunne from London, with letters that tell us the welcome news of the Parliament’s votes yesterday, which will be remembered for the happiest May-day that hath been many a year to England.

1660-05-02 12:50   In the morning at a breakfast of radishes at the Purser’s cabin. After that to writing till dinner.


1660-05-01 21:50   I hear they were very merry at Deal, setting up the King’s flag upon one of their maypoles, and drinking his health upon their knees in the streets, and firing the guns, which the soldiers of the Castle threatened; but durst not oppose.

1660-05-01 19:30   While we were at supper we heard a great noise upon the Quarter Deck, so we all rose instantly, and found it was to save the coxon of the Cheriton, who, dropping overboard, could not be saved, but was drowned.

1660-05-01 19:10   Today I put on my suit that was altered from the great skirts to little ones.

1660-05-01 16:50   After dinner to nine-pins, and won something. The rest of the afternoon in my cabin writing and piping.

1660-05-01 11:45   Captain Parker came on board, and without his expectation I had a commission for him for the Nonsuch frigate (he being now in the Cheriton), for which he gave me a French pistole.

1660-05-01 11:00   This day I do count myself to have had full two years of perfect cure for the stone, for which God of heaven be blessed.

1660-05-01 09:30   I was told how the people of Deal have set up two or three Maypoles, and have hung up their flags upon the top of them, and do resolve to be very merry today. It being a very pleasant day, I wished myself in Hide Park.
