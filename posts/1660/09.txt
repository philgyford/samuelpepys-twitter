1660-09-30 22:40   Went to bed without prayers, my house being every where foul above stairs.

1660-09-30 16:00   To our Parish church both forenoon and afternoon all alone.

1660-09-29 19:55   Indeed my kitchen is now so handsome that I did not repent of all the trouble that I have been put to, to have it done.

1660-09-29 19:40   All day at home to make an end of our dirty work of the plasterers.

1660-09-29 11:30   I hear Prince Rupert is come to Court; but welcome to nobody.

1660-09-28 22:20   Among my workmen, and did give them drink and merry with them, it being my luck to meet with a sort of drolling workmen on all occasions.

1660-09-27 20:20   To my Lord’s, and there did read over with him and Dr. Walker my lord’s new commission for sea, and advised thereupon how to have it drawn.

1660-09-26 22:50   Thinking to have found Will at home, but he gone somewhere else I was very angry, and when he came did give him a very great check for it.

1660-09-26 20:40   In the evening to the office, where I fell a-reading of Speed’s Geography for a while.

1660-09-26 17:30   At home with the workmen all the afternoon, our house being in a most sad pickle.

1660-09-26 12:10   To the church, to consult about our gallery.

1660-09-25 22:30   By coach home, where the plasterers being at work in all the rooms in my house, my wife was fain to make a bed upon the ground.

1660-09-25 20:10   My Lord told me how the ship that brought him did knock six times upon the Kentish Knock, which put them in great fear for the ship.

1660-09-25 18:50   I found my Lord gone to Mr. Crew’s, where I found him well, only had got some corns upon his foot which was not well yet.

1660-09-25 11:00   From Tower wharf we went to Deptford to pay off the ship Success, which (Sir G. Carteret and Sir W. Pen coming afterwards to us) we did.

1660-09-25 10:30   I did send for a cup of tee (a China drink) of which I never had drank before.

1660-09-25 09:50   To the office, where we talked together of the interest of this kingdom to have a peace with Spain and a war with France and Holland.

1660-09-24 22:00   I saw good dancing, but it growing late, and the room very full of people and so very hot, I went home.

1660-09-24 20:40   There passed me Mons. L’Impertinent for whom I took a coach and went with him to a dancing meeting in Broad Street.

1660-09-24 15:26   Though I am wholly ignorant in the duty of a justice of peace.

1660-09-24 15:15   We were sworn justices of peace for Middlesex, Essex, Kent, and Southampton; with which honour I did find myself mightily pleased.

1660-09-24 15:00   To the Temple church, where I had appointed Sir W. Batten to meet him; and there at Sir Heneage Finch Sollicitor General’s chambers.

1660-09-24 13:35   Among the rest my Cozen Rich. Pepys, their elder brother, whom I had not seen these fourteen years, ever since he came from New England.

1660-09-23 16:50   After sermon with Mr. Pierce to Whitehall, and from thence to my Lord, but Diana did not come according to our agreement.

1660-09-23 15:50   In the midst of the sermon some plaster fell from the top of the Abbey, that made me and all the rest afeard, and I wished myself out.

1660-09-23 15:30   I laughed at the reader, who desires that God would imprint his word on the thumbs of our right hands and the great toes of our right feet.

1660-09-23 15:10   To the Abbey, where I expected to hear Mr. Baxter or Mr. Rowe preach their farewell sermon, and in Mr. Symons’s pew I sat.

1660-09-23 11:30   To church my wife and I, with Sir W. Batten, where we heard of Mr. Mills a very good sermon upon these words, “So run that ye may obtain.”

1660-09-23 08:40   Came one from my father’s with a black cloth coat, made of my short cloak, to walk up and down in.

1660-09-23 07:50   My wife got up to put on her mourning to-day and to go to Church this morning.

1660-09-22 22:40   I had the boy up to-night for his sister to teach him to put me to bed, and I heard him read, which he did pretty well.

1660-09-22 19:30   At the New Exchange I bought a pair of short black stockings, to wear over a pair of silk ones for mourning.

1660-09-22 18:10   I went out to Mr. Harper’s, and Diana standing over the way at the gate, I went over to her and appointed to meet to-morrow at my Lord’s.

1660-09-22 17:20   I staid here all day in my Lord’s chamber and upon the leads gazing upon Diana, who looked out of a window upon me.

1660-09-22 09:50   To my Lord’s, and there in the house of office vomited up all my breakfast, my stomach being ill by reason of the last night’s debauch.

1660-09-22 08:40   To Fleet street, where at Mr. Standing’s in Salsbury Court we drank our morning draft and had a pickled herring.

1660-09-22 07:20   I called up my boy, and found him a pretty, well-looked boy, and one that I think will please me.

1660-09-21 23:10   Home, where I found my boy (my maid’s brother) come out of the country to-day, but was gone to bed and so I could not see him to-night.

1660-09-21 22:30   I called in with them at Mr. Chaplin’s, where Nicholas Osborne did give me a barrel of samphire, and showed me the keys of Mardyke Fort.

1660-09-21 21:45   We did eat above 200 walnuts.

1660-09-21 20:45   The drawing of our wine causing a great quarrel in the house between the two drawers which should draw us the best.

1660-09-21 20:30   To the Hoop Tavern and sent for Mr. Chaplin, who with Nicholas Osborne and one Daniel came to us and we drank two or three quarts of wine.

1660-09-20 19:10   By water to the Bridge, and so to Major Hart’s lodgings in Cannon-street, who used me very kindly with wine and good discourse.

1660-09-20 16:20   We called to speak with my Landlord Beale. He was not within but spoke with the old woman, who takes it ill that I did not let her have it.

1660-09-20 16:00   With Mr. Dalton to my house and took away all my papers that were left in my closet, and so I have now nothing more in the house.

1660-09-20 12:20   At home, and at the office, and in the garden walking with both Sir Williams all the morning.

1660-09-19 23:20   We staid till it was very late; it rained sadly, but we made shift to get coaches. So home and to bed.

1660-09-19 19:10   Among other pleasures some of us fell to handycapp, a sport that I never knew before, which was very good.

1660-09-19 13:10   I went, and left my wife to put on some other clothes and come after me to the Mitre tavern in Wood-street (a house of the greatest note).

1660-09-19 12:00   Thinking to have found my wife in her mourning, I found that the tailor had failed her. I was vexed because of an invitation to a dinner.

1660-09-19 08:40   I put on my mourning and went to the office.

1660-09-18 19:20   On foot home, by the way buying a hat band and other things for my mourning to-morrow.

1660-09-14 19:40   Luellin being drunk, and I being to defend the ladies from his kissing them, I kissed them myself very often with a great deal of mirth.

1660-09-14 14:40   My wife went to see my mother, who I hear is very ill, at which my heart is very sad.

1660-09-12 12:30   This noon I expected to have had my cousin Snow and my father come to dine with me, but it being very rainy they did not come.

1660-09-11 21:30   Up to my chamber to read a little, and wrote my Diary for three or four days past.

1660-09-11 19:10   I caused the girl to wash the wainscot of our parlour, which she did very well, which caused my wife and I good sport.

1660-09-11 17:40   All the afternoon at home looking over my carpenters.

1660-09-11 13:50   Dined at Sir W. Batten’s, and by this time I see that we are like to have a very good correspondence and neighbourhood, but chargeable.

1660-09-11 10:10   At Sir W. Batten’s with Sir W. Pen we drank our morning draft, and from thence for an hour in the office and dispatch a little business.

1660-09-10 23:10   So home, having drunk too much, and so to bed.

1660-09-10 18:20   Mr. Snow came to me to see me, and with him and one Shelston, a simple fellow that looks after an employment, to a tavern.

1660-09-10 14:10   To the office and found Sir W. Batten at dinner with some friends upon a good chine of beef, on which I ate heartily, I being very hungry.

1660-09-08 21:10   Sent for by Sir W. Pen, with whom I sat drinking a glass of wine. I find him to be a very sociable man, and an able man, and very cunning.

1660-09-07 20:40   This day my Lord set sail from the Downs for Holland.

1660-09-07 17:30   In the afternoon at home all the day, it being the first that I have been at home all day since I came hither.

1660-09-05 18:20   My wife being a little impatient I went along with her to buy her a necklace of pearl, which will cost 4l. 10s., for her encouragement.

1660-09-05 17:00   Great news now-a-day of the Duke d’Anjou’s desire to marry the Princesse Henrietta.

1660-09-05 14:35   His father could not speak against my putting him away, and so I did give him 10s. for the boy’s clothes that I made him, and so parted.

1660-09-05 14:20   Having put away my boy in the morning, his father brought him again, but I did clear up my boy’s roguery to his father.

1660-09-03 20:40   This day my father and my uncle Fenner and his sons, have been at my house to see it. My wife did treat them nobly with wine and anchovies.

1660-09-03 14:30   With Mr. Moore to my house to cast up our Privy Seal accounts, where I found that my Lord’s comes to 400 and odd pounds, and mine to 132l.

1660-09-03 10:50   I took leave of my Lord, he going to the Downs, which put me in mind of his first voyage, which he did begin like this from Lambeth.

1660-09-03 09:40   To the goldsmith, where I bought my wedding ring, and got him to put a gold ring to the jewell, which the King of Sweden did give my Lord.

1660-09-01 13:55   Rose a dispute between Mr. Moore and Dr. Clerke, the former affirming that it was essential to a tragedy to have the argument of it true.

1660-09-01 13:40   We dined at the Bullhead upon the best venison pasty that I eat of in my life, and with one dish more it was the best dinner I ever was at.

1660-09-01 11:40   Mr. Baron had got possession of the office from his brother Bickerstaffe which is much to our admiration, it being against all open justice.

1660-09-01 09:30   My Lord and I did look over the Commission drawn for him by the Duke’s Council, which I do not find my Lord displeased with.
