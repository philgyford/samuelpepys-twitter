1660-09-30 22:40   Went to bed without prayers, my house being every where foul above stairs.

1660-09-30 16:00   To our Parish church both forenoon and afternoon all alone.


1660-09-29 22:00   This day or yesterday, I hear, Prince Rupert is come to Court; but welcome to nobody.

1660-09-29 19:40   All day at home to make an end of our dirty work of the plasterers, and indeed my kitchen is now so handsome that I did not repent of all the trouble that I have been put to, to have it done.


1660-09-28 22:20   Among my workmen, and did give them drink and very merry with them, it being my luck to meet with a sort of drolling workmen on all occasions. To bed.

1660-09-28 10:10   Sir W. Batten and Col. Slingsby went with Col. Birch and Sir Wm. Doyly to Chatham to pay off a ship there. So only Sir W. Pen and I left here in town.


1660-09-27 20:20   To my Lord’s, and there did read over with him and Dr. Walker my lord’s new commission for sea, and advised thereupon how to have it drawn.


1660-09-26 22:50   Home thinking to have found Will at home, but he not being come home but gone somewhere else I was very angry, and when he came did give him a very great check for it, and so I went to bed.

1660-09-26 20:40   To the office, where I fell a-reading of Speed’s Geography for a while.

1660-09-26 17:30   At home with the workmen all the afternoon, our house being in a most sad pickle.

1660-09-26 13:00   Home to dinner, where I found Mrs. Hunt, who brought me a letter for me to get my Lord to sign for her husband, which I shall do for her.

1660-09-26 12:10   To the church, to consult about our gallery.


1660-09-25 22:30   By coach home, where the plasterers being at work in all the rooms in my house, my wife was fain to make a bed upon the ground for her and me.

1660-09-25 20:10 r My Lord told me how the ship that brought the Princess and him (The Tredagh) did knock six times upon the Kentish Knock, which put them in great fear for the ship; but got off well.

1660-09-25 18:50   By coach to Westminster to inquire for my Lord’s coming thither (the King and the Princess coming up the river this afternoon as we were at our pay), and I found him gone to Mr. Crew’s, where I found him well, only had got some corns upon his foot which was not well yet.

1660-09-25 11:00 r From Tower wharf in the barge belonging to our office we went to Deptford to pay off the ship Success, which we did, Col. Birch being a mighty busy man and one that is the most indefatigable and forward to make himself work of any man that ever I knew in my life.

1660-09-25 10:30 r I did send for a cup of tee (a China drink) of which I never had drank before, and went away.

1660-09-25 09:50   To the office, where Sir R. Ford coming to us about some business, we talked together of the interest of this kingdom to have a peace with Spain and a war with France and Holland; where Sir R. Ford talked like a man of great reason and experience.


1660-09-24 20:40   There passed me Mons. L’Impertinent for whom I took a coach and went with him to a dancing meeting in Broad Street, at the house that was formerly the glass-house, Luke Channel, Master of the School, where I saw good dancing.

1660-09-24 17:10 r With Sir William to Whitehall by water intending to speak with Secretary Nicholas about the augmentation of our salaries, but being forth we went to the Three Tuns tavern, where we drank awhile.

1660-09-24 15:15 r Sir Heneage Finch Sollicitor General and Sir W. Wilde, Recorder of London we were sworn justices of peace for Middlesex, Essex, Kent, and Southampton; with which honour I did find myself mightily pleased, though I am wholly ignorant in the duty of a justice of peace.

1660-09-24 15:00 r I rose from table and went to the Temple church, where I had appointed Sir W. Batten to meet him.

1660-09-24 13:35 r Among the rest my Cozen Rich. Pepys, their elder brother, whom I had not seen these fourteen years, ever since he came from New England.

1660-09-24 13:20 r So thither again to dinner, where was my uncle Fenner and my aunt, my father and mother, and others.

1660-09-24 12:30   To dinner by coach with my wife to my Cozen Scott’s, and the company not being come, I went over the way to the Barber’s.


1660-09-23 21:20   This afternoon, the King having news of the Princess being come to Margate, he and the Duke of York went down thither in barges to her.

1660-09-23 16:50 r After sermon with Mr. Pierce to Whitehall, and from thence to my Lord, but Diana did not come according to our agreement.

1660-09-23 15:40 r In the midst of the sermon some plaster fell from the top of the Abbey, that made me and all the rest in our pew afeard, and I wished myself out.

1660-09-23 15:30 r Before sermon I laughed at the reader, who in his prayer desires of God that He would imprint his word on the thumbs of our right hands and on the right great toes of our right feet.

1660-09-23 15:10   To the Abbey, where I expected to hear Mr. Baxter or Mr. Rowe preach their farewell sermon, and in Mr. Symons’s pew I sat and heard Mr. Rowe.

1660-09-23 11:30   To church my wife and I, with Sir W. Batten, where we heard of Mr. Mills a very good sermon upon these words, “So run that ye may obtain.”

1660-09-23 08:40 r Came one from my father’s with a black cloth coat, made of my short cloak, to walk up and down in.

1660-09-23 07:50   My wife got up to put on her mourning today and to go to Church this morning. I up and set down my journall for these 5 days past.


1660-09-22 22:40   Not well of my last night’s drinking yet. I had the boy up tonight for his sister to teach him to put me to bed, and I heard him read, which he did pretty well.

1660-09-22 20:40   Mr. Edw. Pickering is come from my Lord, and says that he left him well in Holland, and that he will be here within three or four days.

1660-09-22 19:30   At the New Exchange I bought a pair of short black stockings, to wear over a pair of silk ones for mourning; and here I met with The. Turner and Joyce, buying of things to go into mourning too for the Duke, which is now the mode of all the ladies in town.

1660-09-22 18:10 r At last I went out to Mr. Harper’s, and she standing over the way at the gate, I went over to her and appointed to meet tomorrow in the afternoon at my Lord’s. Here I bought a hanging jack.

1660-09-22 17:20 r I staid here all day in my Lord’s chamber and upon the leads gazing upon Diana, who looked out of a window upon me.

1660-09-22 09:50 r To Westminster to my Lord’s, and there in the house of office vomited up all my breakfast, my stomach being ill all this day by reason of the last night’s debauch.

1660-09-22 08:40   To Fleet street, where at Mr. Standing’s in Salsbury Court we drank our morning draft and had a pickled herring.

1660-09-22 07:20 r I called up my boy, and found him a pretty, well-looked boy, and one that I think will please me.


1660-09-21 23:10   Home, where I found my boy (my maid’s brother) come out of the country to-day, but was gone to bed and so I could not see him tonight.

1660-09-21 22:30 r I called in at Mr. Chaplin’s, where Nicholas Osborne showed me the keys of Mardyke Fort, which he that was commander of the fort sent him as a token when the fort was demolished, which I was mightily pleased to see, and will get them of him if I can.

1660-09-21 21:45 r The master came up to us and did give us a large account of the liberty that he gives his servants, all alike, to draw what wine they will to please his customers; and we did eat above 200 walnuts.

1660-09-21 20:45 r The drawing of our wine causing a great quarrel in the house between the two drawers which should draw us the best, which caused a great deal of noise and falling out till the master parted them.

1660-09-21 20:30 r I landed at the old Swan and went to the Hoop Tavern, and (by a former agreement) sent for Mr. Chaplin, who with Nicholas Osborne and one Daniel came to us and we drank off two or three quarts of wine, which was very good.

1660-09-21 20:00   Upon the water saw the corpse of the Duke of Gloucester brought down Somerset House stairs, to go by water to Westminster, to be buried tonight.

1660-09-21 17:00   To Whitehall, thinking to have put up my books at my Lord’s, but am disappointed from want of a chest which I had at Mr. Bowyer’s.


1660-09-20 19:10   By water to the Bridge, and so to Major Hart’s lodgings in Cannon-street, who used me very kindly with wine and good discourse, particularly upon the ill method which Colonel Birch and the Committee use in defending of the army and the navy.

1660-09-20 16:20 r We called to speak with my Landlord Beale, but he was not within but spoke with the old woman, who takes it very ill that I did not let her have it, but I did give her an answer.

1660-09-20 16:00   To Whitehall to Mr. Dalton, and with him to my house and took away all my papers that were left in my closet, and so I have now nothing more in the house or to do with it.

1660-09-20 12:20   At home, and at the office, and in the garden walking with both Sir Williams all the morning.


1660-09-19 23:20 r We staid till it was very late; it rained sadly, but we made shift to get coaches. So home and to bed.

1660-09-19 19:10 r Among other pleasures some of us fell to handycapp, a sport that I never knew before, which was very good.

1660-09-19 15:40 r Here we were very merry and had a very good dinner, my wife coming after me hither to us.

1660-09-19 13:50 r I met W. Symons, and D. Scobell, and their wives, Mr. Samford, Luellin, Chetwind, one Mr. Vivion, and Mr. White, formerly chaplin to the Lady Protectresse (and still so, and one they say that is likely to get my Lady Francess for his wife).

1660-09-19 13:10 r After having waited till past one o’clock I went, and left her to put on some other clothes and come after me to the Mitre tavern in Wood-street (a house of the greatest note in London).

1660-09-19 12:00 r Thinking to have found my wife in mourning, I found that the tailor had failed her, at which I was vexed because of an invitation that we have to a dinner this day.

1660-09-19 08:40   I put on my mourning and went to the office.


1660-09-18 19:20   On foot home, by the way buying a hat band and other things for my mourning tomorrow.

1660-09-18 15:40 r Col. Birch was very impertinent and troublesome. But at last we did agree to fit the accounts of our ships more perfectly for their view within a few days, that they might see what a trouble it is to do what they desire.

1660-09-18 15:10   To Westminster Hall, where we met Mr. Wayte the lawyer to the Treasurer, and so we went up to the Committee of Parliament, which are to consider of the debts of the Army and Navy, and did give in our account of the twenty-five ships.

1660-09-18 12:10   At home all the morning looking over my workmen in my house.


1660-09-17 22:20   So to bed after I had looked over the things my wife had bought today, with which being not very well pleased, they costing too much, I went to bed in a discontent.

1660-09-17 17:50   To the Wine cellar again, where I received 41l. for my interest in my house, out of which I paid my Landlord to Michaelmas next, and so all is even between him and me, and I freed of my poor little house. Home by link with my money under my arm.

1660-09-17 15:00   To see the Prince de Ligne, Spanish Embassador, come in to his audience, which was done in very great state.

1660-09-17 14:10   Dined at home and Mr. Moore with me, and afterwards to Whitehall to Mr. Dalton and drank in the Cellar, where Mr. Vanly according to appointment was.

1660-09-17 10:40   I did give my wife 15l. to go to buy mourning things for her and me, which she did.


1660-09-16 22:20   Home late, being very dark. A gentleman in the Poultry had a great and dirty fall over a waterpipe that lay along the channel.

1660-09-16 21:50   Met with Dinah, who spoke to me and told me she had a desire to speak too about some business when I came to Westminster again. Which she spoke in such a manner that I was afraid she might tell me something that I would not hear of our last meeting at my house at Westminster.

1660-09-16 17:40   To White Hall garden, where I saw the King in purple mourning for his brother.

1660-09-16 16:10   To the Park, where I saw how far they had proceeded in the Pell-mell, and in making a river through the Park, which I had never seen before since it was begun.

1660-09-16 15:00   Fetters the watchmaker told me that my Lord of Oxford is also dead of the small-pox; in whom his family dies, after 600 years having that honour in their family and name.

1660-09-16 13:50   Home to dinner, having some sport with Wm. Hewer, who never had been at Common Prayer before.

1660-09-16 11:45   To Dr. Hardy’s church, and sat with Mr. Rawlinson and heard a good sermon upon the occasion of the Duke’s death. His text was, “And is there any evil in the city and the Lord hath not done it?”


1660-09-15 19:30   Called at my father’s going home, and bespoke mourning for myself, for the death of the Duke of Gloucester. I found my mother pretty well.

1660-09-15 16:20   To Westminster, where I met with Dr. Castles, who chidd me for some errors in our Privy-Seal business; among the rest, for letting the fees of the six judges pass unpaid, which I know not what to say to, till I speak to Mr. Moore.

1660-09-15 13:50   Mr. Dalton at his office, where we had one great court dish, but our papers not being done we could not make an end of our business.

1660-09-15 07:40   Met very early at our office to pick out the twenty-five ships which are to be first paid off.


1660-09-14 19:40 r Luellin being drunk, and I being to defend the ladies from his kissing them, I kissed them myself very often with a great deal of mirth.

1660-09-14 16:50   Luellin comes to my house, and takes me out to the Mitre in Wood Street, where Mr. Samford, W. Symons and his wife, and Mrs. Scobell, Mr. Mount and Chetwind, where they were very merry.

1660-09-14 14:40   My wife went to see my mother, who I hear is very ill, at which my heart is very sad.


1660-09-13 20:10   This day the Duke of Gloucester died of the small-pox, by the great negligence of the doctors.

1660-09-13 16:30   To Westminster, where Mr. Dalton was ready with his money to pay me for my house, but our writings not being drawn it could not be done today.

1660-09-13 15:40   My wife went to the burial of a child of my cozen Scott’s, and it is observable that within this month my Aunt Wight was brought to bed of two girls, my cozen Stradwick of a girl and a boy, and my cozen Scott of a boy, and all died.

1660-09-13 09:50   Old East comes to me in the morning with letters, and I did give him a bottle of Northdown ale, which made the poor man almost drunk.


1660-09-12 17:50   At home all the afternoon looking after my workmen, whose laziness do much trouble me.

1660-09-12 15:10   My brother Tom came to my house with a letter from my brother John, wherein he desires some books: Barthol. Anatom., Rosin. Rom. Antiq., and Gassend. Astronom., the last of which I did give him, and an angel against my father buying of the others.

1660-09-12 12:30   This noon I expected to have had my cousin Snow and my father come to dine with me, but it being very rainy they did not come.


1660-09-11 22:20   The Duke of York did go today by break of day to the Downs. The Duke of Gloucester ill. The House of Parliament was to adjourn today. I know not yet whether it be done or no.

1660-09-11 21:30   Up to my chamber to read a little, and wrote my Diary for three or four days past.

1660-09-11 19:10   I caused the girl to wash the wainscot of our parlour, which she did very well, which caused my wife and I good sport.

1660-09-11 17:40   All the afternoon at home looking over my carpenters.

1660-09-11 13:50   Dined at Sir W. Batten’s, and by this time I see that we are like to have a very good correspondence and neighbourhood, but chargeable.

1660-09-11 10:10   At Sir W. Batten’s with Sir W. Pen we drank our morning draft, and from thence for an hour in the office and dispatch a little business.


1660-09-10 23:40 r So home, having drunk too much, and so to bed.

1660-09-10 23:10   Home, where Mr. Snow (whom afterwards we called one another cozen) came to me to see me, and with him and one Shelston, a simple fellow that looks after an employment (that was with me just upon my going to sea last), to a tavern, where till late with them.

1660-09-10 14:10   To the office and found Sir W. Batten at dinner with some friends upon a good chine of beef, on which I ate heartily, I being very hungry.

1660-09-10 10:50 r So we returned and landed at the Bear at the Bridge foot, where we saw Southwark Fair (I having not at all seen Bartholomew Fair), and so to the Tower wharf, where we did hire two catches.

1660-09-10 09:40   Col. Slingsby and I to Whitehall, thinking to proffer our service to the Duke to wait upon him, but meeting with Sir G. Carteret he sent us in all haste back again to hire two Catches for the present use of the Duke.


1660-09-09 16:30   Walked with Major Hart in the garden, who tells me that we are all like to be speedily disbanded; and then I lose the benefit of a muster.

1660-09-09 13:50   Home to dinner, and Sir W. Pen with me to such as I had, and it was very handsome, it being the first time that he ever saw my wife or house since we came hither.


1660-09-08 22:10   Sent for by Sir W. Pen, with whom I sat late drinking a glass of wine and discoursing, and I find him to be a very sociable man, and an able man, and very cunning.


1660-09-07 20:40   This day my Lord set sail from the Downs for Holland.

1660-09-07 17:30   In the afternoon at home all the day, it being the first that I have been at home all day since I came hither.

1660-09-07 15:00   Putting my papers, books and other things in order, and writing of letters.


1660-09-06 12:50   We met at the Admiralty, where our business is to ask provision of victuals ready for the ships in the Downs, which we did, Mr. Gauden promising to go himself thither and see it done.

1660-09-06 11:20 r I find that Commissioner Pett is loth to give too much money for his place, and so do greatly desire me to go along with him in what we shall agree to give Mr. Coventry, which I have promised him, but am unwilling to mix my fortune with him that is going down the wind.

1660-09-06 10:50 r At Whitehall I met with Commissioner Pett, who told me how Mr. Coventry and Fairbank his solicitor are falling out, one complaining of the other for taking too great fees, which is too true.

1660-09-06 10:10   Sir W. Batten told me how Commissioner Pett did pay himself for the entertainment that he did give the King at Chatham at his coming in, and 20s. a day all the time he was in Holland, which I wonder at, and so I see there is a great deal of envy between the two.


1660-09-05 22:50   Home, and having in our way bought a rabbit and two little lobsters, my wife and I did sup late, and so to bed.

1660-09-05 18:20   My wife being a little impatient I went along with her to buy her a necklace of pearl, which will cost 4l. 10s., which I am willing to comply with her in for her encouragement, and because I have lately got money, having now above 200l. in cash beforehand in the world.

1660-09-05 17:50   Hugh Peters is said to be taken, and the Duke of Gloucester is ill, and it is said it will prove the small-pox.

1660-09-05 17:00   Great news now-a-day of the Duke d’Anjou’s desire to marry the Princesse Henrietta.

1660-09-05 14:20   Home, where (having put away my boy in the morning) his father brought him again, but I did so clear up my boy’s roguery to his father, that he could not speak against my putting him away, and so I did give him 10s. for the boy’s clothes that I made him, and so parted.

1660-09-05 11:50 r Coming back our coach broke, and so Stowell and I to Mr. Rawlinson’s, and after a glass of wine parted, and I to the office.

1660-09-05 11:10   By coach upon the desire of the principal officers to a Master of Chancery to give Mr. Stowell his oath, whereby he do answer that he did hear Phineas Pett say very high words against the King a great while ago.

1660-09-05 08:30   To the office.


1660-09-04 23:20   So home by water, and there sat up late setting my papers in order, and my money also, and teaching my wife her music lesson, in which I take great pleasure.

1660-09-04 18:10   To Axe Yard to my house, where standing at the door Mrs. Diana comes by, whom I took into my house upstairs, and there did dally with her a great while, and found that in Latin “Nulla puella negat.”

1660-09-04 14:00   To the Bullhead, where we had the remains of our pasty, where I did give my verdict against Mr. Moore upon last Saturday’s wager, where Dr. Fuller coming in do confirm me in my verdict.

1660-09-04 11:50   I did many things this morning at home before I went out, as looking over the joiners, who are flooring my diningroom, and doing business with Sir Williams both at the office.


1660-09-03 20:40   This day my father and my uncle Fenner, and both his sons, have been at my house to see it, and my wife did treat them nobly with wine and anchovies.

1660-09-03 17:20   Home, and there found Mr. Cooke come back from my Lord for me to get him some things bought for him to be brought after them, a toilet cap and comb case of silk, to make use of in Holland, for he goes to the Hague.

1660-09-03 14:30   With Mr. Moore to my house to cast up our Privy Seal accounts, where I found that my Lord’s comes to 400 and odd pounds, and mine to 132l., out of which I do give him as good as 25l. for his pains, with which I doubt he is not satisfied, but my heart is full glad.

1660-09-03 12:30   My Lord, having taken leave of the King in the Shield Gallery (where I saw with what kindness the King did hug my Lord at his parting), I went over with him and saw him in his coach at Lambeth, and there took leave of him, he going to the Downs.

1660-09-03 09:40   To the goldsmith near the new Exchange, where I bought my wedding ring, and there, with much ado, got him to put a gold ring to the jewell, which the King of Sweden did give my Lord: out of which my Lord had now taken the King’s picture, and intends to make a George of it.


1660-09-02 22:40   I drank till the daughter began to be very loving to me and kind, and I fear is not so good as she should be.

1660-09-02 21:10   From church to Mrs. Crisp’s (having sent Will Hewer home to tell my wife that I could not come home tonight because of my Lord’s going out early tomorrow morning), where I sat late, and did give them a great deal of wine, it being a farewell cup to Laud Crisp.

1660-09-02 15:30   To St. Margarett’s, and heard a good sermon upon the text “Teach us the old way,” or something like it, wherein he ran over all the new tenets in policy and religion, which have brought us into all our late divisions.

1660-09-02 11:45   To chappell, where Dr. Fern, a good honest sermon upon “The Lord is my shield.” After sermon a dull anthem.

1660-09-02 10:20   I and Mr. Sheply told out my money, and made even for my Privy Seal fees and gratuity money, &c., to this day between my Lord and me.


1660-09-01 23:20   Late home, and what with business and my boy’s roguery my mind being unquiet, I went to bed.

1660-09-01 16:05   I hear by Mr. Townsend, that there is the greatest preparation against the Prince de Ligne’s a coming over from the King of Spain, that ever was in England for their Embassador.

1660-09-01 13:55   Here rose in discourse at table a dispute between Mr. Moore and Dr. Clerke, the former affirming that it was essential to a tragedy to have the argument of it true, which the Doctor denied, and the cause to be determined next Tuesday morning at the same place.

1660-09-01 13:40   Mr. Moore and I and several others being invited today by Mr. Goodman, a friend of his, we dined at the Bullhead upon the best venison pasty that ever I eat of in my life, and with one dish more, it was the best dinner I ever was at.

1660-09-01 11:40   To the Privy Seal to see how things went there, and I find that Mr. Baron had by a severe warrant from the King got possession of the office from his brother Bickerstaffe, which is very strange, and much to our admiration, it being against all open justice.

1660-09-01 09:30   To White Hall to my Lord, where he and I did look over the Commission drawn for him by the Duke’s Council, which I do not find my Lord displeased with, though short of what Dr. Walker did formerly draw for him.
