1660-04-30 23:50 r To bed very late with drink enough in my head.

1660-04-30 22:30 r Among other frolics he pulls out the spigot of the little vessel of ale that was there in the cabin and drew some into his mounteere, and after he had drank, I endeavouring to dash it in his face, he got my velvet studying cap and drew some into mine too.

1660-04-30 21:20   Mr. Sheply, W. Howe and I up to the Lieutenant’s cabin, where we drank, and I and W. Howe were very merry.

1660-04-30 19:40   On board the Nazeby, where we found my Lord at supper, so I sat down and very pleasant my Lord was with Mr. Creed and Sheply, who he puzzled about finding out the meaning of the three notes which my Lord had cut over the chrystal of his watch.

1660-04-30 17:00 r To boat again, and went to the Assistance where we were treated very civilly by the Captain, and he did give us such music upon the harp by a fellow that he keeps on board that I never expect to hear the like again, yet he is a drunken simple fellow to look on as any I ever saw.

1660-04-30 15:25 r We went to Fuller’s (the famous place for ale), but they have none but what was in the vat. After that to Poole’s, a tavern in the town, where we drank.

1660-04-30 14:45   W. Howe, Mr. Sheply and I got my Lord’s leave to go to see Captain Sparling. So we took boat and first went on shore, it being very pleasant in the fields; but a very pitiful town Deal is.

1660-04-30 14:30   After dinner to ninepins, W. Howe and I against Mr. Creed and the Captain. We lost 5s. apiece to them.

1660-04-30 12:20   All the morning getting instructions ready for the Squadron of ships that are going today to the Streights, among others Captain Teddiman, Curtis, and Captain Robert Blake to be commander of the whole Squadron.


1660-04-29 14:55   I walked a great while upon the deck with the chyrurgeon and purser, and other officers of the ship, and they all pray for the King’s coming, which I pray God send.

1660-04-29 11:40 r A letter is come from the King to the House, which is locked up by the Council ’till next Tuesday that it may be read in the open House when they meet again, they having adjourned till then to keep a fast tomorrow. And so the contents is not yet known.

1660-04-29 11:00   Mr. Cook came from London with a packet, bringing news how all the young lords that were not in arms against the Parliament do now sit.

1660-04-29 07:20   I put on first my fine cloth suit made of a cloak that had like to have been dirted a year ago, the very day that I put it on.


1660-04-28 21:50   After supper my Lord exceeding merry, and he and I and W. Howe to sing, and so to bed.

1660-04-28 16:40   I played at ninepins with Mr. Pickering, I and Mr. Pett against him and Ted Osgood, and won a crown apiece of him. He had not money enough to pay me.


1660-04-27 23:10   Late reading my letters, my mind being much troubled to think that, after all our hopes, we should have any cause to fear any more disappointments therein.

1660-04-27 19:40 r But when I told my Lord it, he shook his head and told me, that the Presbyterians are deceived, for the General is certainly for the King’s interest, and so they will not be able to prevail that way with him.

1660-04-27 19:20   I had from Mr. Moore, that he fears the Cavaliers will be so high, that the others will be forced to leave the House and fall in with General Monk, and so offer things to the King so high on the Presbyterian account that he may refuse, and they will endeavour some more mischief.

1660-04-27 17:15   Came on board Sir Thomas Hatton and Sir R. Maleverer going for Flushing; but all the world know that they go where the rest of the many gentlemen go that every day flock to the King at Breda.

1660-04-27 12:05   This morning Pim spent in my cabin, putting a great many ribbons to a suit.

1660-04-27 09:50   Burr was absent again from on board, which I was troubled at, and spoke to Mr. Pierce, Purser, to speak to him of it, and it is my mind.


1660-04-26 21:40   To supper, where Tom Guy supped with us, and we had very good laughing, and after that some musique, where Mr. Pickering beginning to play a bass part upon the viall did it so like a fool that I was ashamed of him.

1660-04-26 18:20   Mr. Sheply, W. Howe and I down with J. Goods into my Lord’s storeroom of wine and other drink, where it was very pleasant to observe the massy timbers that the ship is made of. We in the room were wholly under water and yet a deck below that.

1660-04-26 17:10   I was writing of letters, among the rest one to W. Simons, Peter Luellin and Tom Doling, which because it is somewhat merry I keep a copy of.

1660-04-26 15:20 r My Lord told me how Sir H. Yelverton (formerly my school-fellow) was chosen in the first place for Northamptonshire and Mr. Crew in the second. And told me how he did believe that the Cavaliers have now the upper hand clear of the Presbyterians.

1660-04-26 15:00 r Twelve of the Lords met and had chosen my Lord of Manchester Speaker of the House of Lords (the young Lords that never sat yet, do forbear to sit for the present); and Sir Harbottle Grimstone, Speaker for the House of Commons.

1660-04-26 14:40   Came Mr. Donne back from London, who brought letters with him that signify the meeting of the Parliament yesterday.


1660-04-25 18:10   All the afternoon finishing of the character, which I did and gave it my Lord, it being very handsomely done and a very good one in itself, but that not truly Alphabetical.

1660-04-25 14:10 r Home, not a little contented to see how I am treated, and with what respect made a fellow to the best commanders in the Fleet.

1660-04-25 13:50   Dined today with Captain Clerke on board the Speaker (a very brave ship) where was the Vice-Admiral, Rear-Admiral, and many other commanders.


1660-04-24 21:10   My Lord and we had some more very good musique and singing of “Turne Amaryllis,” as it is printed in the song book, with which my Lord was very much pleased.

1660-04-24 19:20   My Lord gave a great large character to write out, so I spent all the day about it.

1660-04-24 15:50   We were saluted with the news of Lambert’s being taken, which news was brought to London on Sunday last. He was taken in Northamptonshire by Colonel Ingoldsby, at the head of a party, by which means their whole design is broke, and things now very open and safe.

1660-04-24 14:20 r I rose therefore from table and went, where there was very many commanders, and very pleasant we were on board the London, which hath a state-room much bigger than the Nazeby, but not so rich.

1660-04-24 13:10   While I was at dinner with my Lord, the Coxon of the Vice-Admiral came for me to the Vice-Admiral to dinner. So I told my Lord and he gave me leave to go.


1660-04-23 21:40    W. Howe and I went to play two trebles, which my Lord hearing, he called for our instruments, and played a set of Lock’s, two trebles, and a base, and he fell to singing of a song made upon the Rump, with which he played himself well, to the tune of “The Blacksmith.”

1660-04-23 19:20   The first time that we had any sport among the seamen, and indeed there was extraordinary good sport after my Lord had done playing at ninepins.

1660-04-23 12:10   Very busy getting my packet ready for London, only for an hour or two had the Captain and Mr. Sheply in my cabin at the barrel of pickled oysters that the Captain did give me.


1660-04-22 14:05 r Also they told us for certain, that the King’s statue is making by the Mercers’ Company (who are bound to do it) to set up in the Exchange.

1660-04-22 14:00   Several Londoners, strangers, friends of the Captains, dined here, who, among other things told us, how the King’s Arms are every day set up in houses and churches, particularly in Allhallows Church in Thames-street, John Simpson’s church.


1660-04-21 22:20   Late singing with W. Howe, and under the barber’s hands in the coach.

1660-04-21 16:40   The Captain would by all means have me up to his cabin, and there treated me huge nobly, giving me a barrel of pickled oysters, and opened another for me, and a bottle of wine, which was a very great favour.

1660-04-21 15:20   I had a large letter from Mr. Moore, giving me an account of the present dispute at London that is like to be at the beginning of the Parliament, about the House of Lords, who do resolve to sit with the Commons, as not thinking themselves dissolved yet.

1660-04-21 13:50 r All their discourse and others are of the King’s coming, and we begin to speak of it very freely. And heard how in many churches in London, and upon many signs there, and upon merchants’ ships in the river, they had set up the King’s arms.

1660-04-21 13:40   Dined Sir John Boys and some other gentlemen formerly great Cavaliers, and among the rest one Mr. Norwood, for whom my Lord give a convoy to carry him to the Brill, but he is certainly going to the King.


1660-04-20 20:40   Mr. Sheply told me that he heard for certain at Dover that Mr. Edw. Montagu did go beyond sea when he was here first the other day, and I am apt to believe that he went to speak with the King.

1660-04-20 20:00   This evening my head ached exceedingly, which I impute to my sitting backwards in my cabin, otherwise than I am used to do.

1660-04-20 16:30   One told me how that at the election at Cambridge for knights of the shire, Wendby and Thornton by declaring to stand for the Parliament and a King and the settlement of the Church, did carry it against all expectation against Sir Dudley North and Sir Thomas Willis!

1660-04-20 11:50   I was busy to get my window altered, and to have my table set as I would have it, which after it was done I was infinitely pleased with it, and also to see what a command I have to have every one ready to come and go at my command.


1660-04-19 21:40   This day it has rained much, so that when I came to go to bed I found it wet through, so I was fain to wrap myself up in a dry sheet.

1660-04-19 17:10   A great deal of business all this day, and Burr being gone to shore without my leave did vex me much.

1660-04-19 12:45   At dinner news was brought us that my Lord was chosen at Dover.


1660-04-18 20:47 r It is now clear that either the Fanatiques must now be undone, or the gentry and citizens throughout England, and clergy must fall, in spite of their militia and army, which is not at all possible I think.

1660-04-18 20:40 r It is evident now that the General and the Council do resolve to make way for the King’s coming.

1660-04-18 20:20   The Lords do meet every day at my Lord of Manchester’s, and resolve to sit the first day of the Parliament.

1660-04-18 16:40   I all the afternoon dictating in my cabin (my own head being troubled with multiplicity of business) to Burr, who wrote for me above a dozen letters, by which I have made my mind more light and clear than I have had it yet since I came on board.

1660-04-18 11:00   Sir R. Stayner, Mr. Sheply, and as many of my Lord’s people as could be spared went to Dover to get things ready against tomorrow for the election there.

1660-04-18 06:20   Came Mr. Edward Montagu on board, but what was the business of his coming again or before without any servant and making no stay at all I cannot guess.


1660-04-17 22:55   So to sleep, every day bringing me a fresh sense of the pleasure of my present life.

1660-04-17 22:40   To bed, and shifting myself from top to toe, there being J. Goods and W. Howe sat late by my bedside talking.

1660-04-17 15:40   It was so clear that my Lord’s glass showed us Calais very plain, and the cliffs were as plain to be seen as Kent, and my Lord at first made me believe that it was Kent.

1660-04-17 12:10   Getting ready commissions for the Vice-Admiral and the Rear-Admiral, wherein my Lord was very careful to express the utmost of his own power, commanding them to obey what orders they should receive from the Parliament, &c., or both or either of the Generals.


1660-04-16 12:00   All the morning giving out orders and tickets to the Commanders of the Fleet to discharge all supernumeraries that they had above the number that the Council had set in their last establishment.

1660-04-16 03:55   Mr. Cook waked me where I lay in the great cabin below, and I did give him his packet and directions for London. So to sleep again.


1660-04-15 20:20   From London I hear that since Lambert got out of the Tower, the Fanatiques had held up their heads high, but I hope all that will come to nothing.

1660-04-15 19:10 r My Lord bid me privately to get two commissions ready, one for Capt. Robert Blake to be captain of the Worcester, in the room of Capt. Dekings, an anabaptist. The other for Capt. Coppin to come out of that into the Newbury in the room of Blake.

1660-04-15 18:40   Mr. Cook came back from London with a packet which caused my Lord to be full of thoughts all day.

1660-04-15 13:00   My Lord told us that the University of Cambridge had a mind to choose him for their burgess, which he pleased himself with, to think that they do look upon him as a thriving man, and said so openly at table.

1660-04-15 07:10   Up early and was trimmed by the barber in the great cabin below.


1660-04-14 22:00   This day I heard that the Army had in general declared to stand by what the next Parliament shall do.

1660-04-14 16:40   My Lord is chosen at Waymouth this morning; my Lord had his freedom brought him by Captain Tiddiman of the port of Dover, by which he is capable of being elected for them.

1660-04-14 15:00   My Lord Lambert is got out of the Towers and there is 100l. proffered to whoever shall bring him forth to the Council of State.

1660-04-14 11:40   The sea was very high, and looking out of the window I saw our boat come with Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, in it in great danger, who endeavouring to come on board us, had like to have been drowned had it not been for a rope.

1660-04-14 10:10 r What with the goodness of the bed and the rocking of the ship I slept till almost ten o’clock, and then rose and drank a good morning draught there with Mr. Sheply, which occasioned my thinking upon the happy life that I live now, had I nothing to care for but myself.

1660-04-14 01:50   To bed, and it being very rainy, and the rain coming upon my bed, I went and lay with John Goods in the great cabin below, the wind being so high that we were fain to lower some of the masts.

1660-04-14 01:15   Writing letters to Mr. Downing about my business of continuing my office to myself, only Mr. Moore to execute it for me. I had also a very serious and effectual letter from my Lord to him to that purpose.


1660-04-13 17:00   I went up to the lieutenant’s cabin and there we broached a vessel of ale that we had sent for among us from Deal today. There was the minister and doctor with us.

1660-04-13 15:30   Set my own things in my cabin and chests in better order than hitherto, and set my papers in order.


1660-04-12 20:15   I sent a packet to London at night with several letters to my friends, as to my wife about my getting of money for her when she should need it.


1660-04-11 23:45  It comes now into my mind to observe that I am sensible that I have been a little too free to make mirth with the minister of our ship, he being a very sober and an upright man.

1660-04-11 23:30   W. Howe and I at our viallins in my cabin, where Mr. Ibbott and the lieutenant were late. I staid the lieutenant late, showing him my manner of keeping a journal.

1660-04-11 19:40 r He confessed to me that he was not sure of his own Captain to be true to him, and that he did not like Captain Stokes.

1660-04-11 19:20   My Lord and I had a great deal of discourse about the several Captains of the Fleet and his interest among them, and had his mind clear to bring in the King.

1660-04-11 17:15 r All the news from London is that things go on further towards a King. That the Skinners’ Company the other day at their entertaining of General Monk had took down the Parliament Arms in their Hall, and set up the King’s.

1660-04-11 16:30   Came a great packet of letters from London directed to me, among the rest two from my wife, the first that I have since coming away from London.

1660-04-11 14:00   The wind was very high, so that a gentleman that was at dinner with my Lord that came along with Sir John Bloys (who seemed a fine man) was forced to rise from table.

1660-04-11 07:04   I ate a good breakfast by my Lord’s orders with him in the great cabin below.


1660-04-10 20:50   As I was all alone in my cabin, in a melancholy fit playing on my viallin, my Lord and Sir R. Stayner came into the coach and supped there, and called me out to supper with them.

1660-04-10 13:35   Hither came the Vice-Admiral to us, and sat and talked and seemed a very good-natured man.

1660-04-10 13:20   Many or most of the commanders in the Fleet came on board and dined here, so that some of them and I dined together in the Round-house, where we were very merry.

1660-04-10 01:05   Balty took leave of me to go away tomorrow morning with Mr. Dickering. I lent Balty 15s. which he was to pay to my wife.


1660-04-09 21:10   Mr. Sheply came on board, having escaped a very great danger upon a sand coming from Chatham.

1660-04-09 17:25   Great was the shout of guns from the castles and ships, and our answers, that I never heard yet so great rattling of guns. Nor could we see one another on board for the smoke that was among us, nor one ship from another.

1660-04-09 17:10   We came to the Goodwin, so to the Castles about Deal; where our Fleet lay, among whom we anchored.

1660-04-09 15:00   I first saw France and Calais, with which I was much pleased, though it was at a distance.

1660-04-09 14:40   We had a very fresh gale, which I brooked better than I thought I should be able to do.

1660-04-09 07:05   We having sailed all night, were come in sight of the North and South Forelands.


1660-04-08 21:00   We continued sailing when I went to bed, being somewhat ill again.

1660-04-08 20:15   Will Howe, the surgeon, parson, and Balty supped in the Lieutenant’s cabin and afterwards sat disputing, the parson for and I against extemporary prayers, very hot.

1660-04-08 16:40   We had a brave wind all the afternoon, and overtook two good merchantmen that overtook us yesterday, going to the East Indies. The lieutenant and I lay out of his window with his glass, looking at the women that were on board them, being pretty handsome.

1660-04-08 11:55   Set sail; in our way I see many vessels and masts, which are now the greatest guides for ships.


1660-04-07 17:15   This day Mr. Sheply went to Sheppy.

1660-04-07 17:00   Went to bed and got a caudle made me.

1660-04-07 16:40   After dinner, and all the afternoon I walked upon the deck to keep myself from being sick.

1660-04-07 12:00   My Lord sent for me down to eat some oysters, the best my Lord said that ever he ate in his life, though I have ate as good at Bardsey.

1660-04-07 09:10   The wind grew high, and we being among the sands lay at anchor; I began to be dizzy and squeamish.


1660-04-06 21:50   It being fine moonshine, I staid late walking upon the quarter-deck with Mr. Cuttance, learning of some sea terms.

1660-04-06 18:10   This afternoon I made even with my Lord to this day, and did give him all the money remaining in my hands.

1660-04-06 17:40   All the day with Balty walking and talking, we under sail as far as the Spitts.

1660-04-06 15:00   W. Howe and I to our viallins, the first time since we came on board.

1660-04-06 09:20   Came my brother-in-law Balty to see me, and to desire to be here with me as Reformado, which did much trouble me.


1660-04-05 20:50   Sir Rich. Stayner and Mr. Creed, after we were come to anchor, did come on board, and Creed brought me 30l., which my Lord had ordered him to pay me upon account, and Captain Clerke brought me a noted caudle.

1660-04-05 18:30   Came in the evening to Lee roads and anchored.

1660-04-05 17:05   I spent all the afternoon upon the deck, it being very pleasant weather.

1660-04-05 12:15   Infinity of business all the morning of orders to make, that I was very much perplexed that Mr. Burr had failed me of coming back last night, and we ready to set sail.


1660-04-04 19:30   My Lord resolved to send the Captain of our ship to Waymouth and promote his being chosen there, which he did put himself into a readiness to do the next morning.

1660-04-04 17:10   The Commissioners came today, only to consult about a further reducement of the Fleet, and to pay them as fast as they can.

1660-04-04 13:05   I dined all alone to prevent company, which was exceeding great today, in my cabin.

1660-04-04 12:35 r And it was strange to hear how Mr. Blackburne did already begin to commend him for a sober man, and how quiet he would be under his government, &c.

1660-04-04 12:30   There come Colonel Thomson with the wooden leg, and General Pen, and dined with my Lord and Mr. Blackburne, who told me that it was certain now that the King must of necessity come in, and that there is something doing in order to a treaty already among them.


1660-04-03 21:40   Busy a-writing, and so to bed. My heart exceeding heavy for not hearing of my dear wife, and indeed I do not remember that ever my heart was so apprehensive of her absence as at this very time.

1660-04-03 19:30   I took the Lieutenant of the Swiftsure, and Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, to my cabin, where we drank a bottle of wine.

1660-04-03 14:30   My Lord went on shore, and after him I and Capt. Sparling went in his boat, but the water being almost at low water we could not stay for fear of not getting into our boat again. So back again.

1660-04-03 11:00   Capt. Isham comes on board to see my Lord and drunk his wine before he went into the Downs, there likewise come many merchants to get convoy to the Baltique, which a course was taken for.

1660-04-03 03:05   There was great knocking at my cabin, which with much difficulty (so they say) waked me, and I rose, but it was only for a packet, so went to my bed again.


1660-04-02 17:30   After dinner I went in one of the boats with my boy before my Lord, and made shift before night to get my cabin in pretty good order. It is but little, but very convenient, having one window to the sea and another to the deck, and a good bed.

1660-04-02 11:15   Comes Mr. Ed. Pickering, like a coxcomb as he always was. He tells me that the King will come in, but that Monk did resolve to have the doing of it himself, or else to hinder it.

1660-04-02 08:45   Mr. Creed was much troubled to hear that he could not go along with my Lord, for he had already got all his things thither, thinking to stay there, but W. Howe was very high against it, and he indeed did put him out, though everybody was glad of it.

1660-04-02 08:20   Great concourse of commanders here this morning to take leave of my Lord upon his going into the Nazeby, so that the table was full.


1660-04-01 22:20   I made a commission for Captain Wilgness, of the Bear, tonight, which got me 30s. So after writing a while I went to bed.

1660-04-01 16:30   Captain Guy come on board from Dunkirk, who tells me that the King will come in, and that the soldiers at Dunkirk do drink the King’s health in the streets.

1660-04-01 14:00   After dinner my Lord did give me a private list of all the ships that were to be set out this summer, wherein I do discern that he hath made it his care to put by as much of the Anabaptists as he can.
