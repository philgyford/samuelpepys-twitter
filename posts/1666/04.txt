1666-04-30 20:20   Home and up to the leads, but were contrary to expectation driven down again with a stink by Sir W. Pen’s emptying of a shitten pot in their house of office close by, which do trouble me for fear it do hereafter annoy me.

1666-04-30 18:28   With my wife and Mercer by coach to take the ayre as far as Bow, and eat and drank in the coach by the way and with much pleasure and pleased with my company.

1666-04-30 16:04   My wife comes home by and by, and hath pitched upon a necklace with three rows, which is a very good one, and 80l. is the price.

1666-04-30 15:41   I to even all my accounts of this month; and, bless God! I find myself, notwithstanding great expenses of late; viz. 80l. now to pay for a necklace; near 40l. for a set of chairs and couch; near 40l. for my three pictures: yet I do gather, and am now worth 5200l.

1666-04-29 22:20   I mighty weary to bed, after having my hair of my head cut shorter, even close to my skull, for coolness, it being mighty hot weather.

1666-04-29 20:14   Walked back again reading and so took water and home, where I find my uncle and aunt Wight, and supped with them upon my leads with mighty pleasure and mirth.

1666-04-29 16:10   Mr. Evelyn being come home, he and I walked together in the garden with mighty pleasure, he being a very ingenious man; and the more I know him, the more I love him.

1666-04-29 14:45   I and my boy down by water to Redriffe and thence walked to Mr. Evelyn’s, where I walked in his garden till he come from Church, with great pleasure reading Ridly’s discourse, all my way going and coming, upon the Civill and Ecclesiastical Law.

1666-04-29 09:20   Up, and to church, where Mr. Mills, a lazy, simple sermon upon the Devil’s having no right to any thing in this world.

1666-04-28 18:33   I writing a letter to my brother John, the first I have done since my being angry with him, and that so sharpe a one too that I was sorry almost to send it when I had wrote it, but it is preparatory to my being kind to him.

1666-04-28 16:03   The tide serving, Balty took leave of us, going to sea, and upon very good terms, to be Muster-Master of a squadron, which will be worth 100l. this year to him, besides keeping him the benefit of his pay in the Guards.

1666-04-28 15:10   My wife also is to look out again for another little girl, the last we had being also gone home the very same day she came. She was also to look after a necklace of pearl, which she is mighty busy about, I being contented to lay out 80l. in one for her.

1666-04-28 15:05   My wife to her father’s, to carry him some ruling work, which I have advised her to let him do. It will get him some money.

1666-04-28 14:35   Abroad with my wife to Hales’s to see only our pictures and Mrs. Pierce’s, which I do not think so fine as I might have expected it.

1666-04-27 15:32 r To the hanging up of maps, and other things for the fitting of the room, and now it will certainly be one of the handsomest and most useful rooms in my house. So that what with this room and the room on my leads my house is half as good again as it was.

1666-04-27 11:09   To the ’Change a little, and there bespoke some maps to hang in my new roome (my boy’s room) which will be very pretty.

1666-04-26 12:03   To the office, where all the morning.

1666-04-25 23:22   The plague, blessed be God! is decreased sixteen this week.

1666-04-25 23:05 r My wife and I staid there talking of several things with great pleasure till eleven o’clock at night, and it is a convenience I would not want for any thing in the world, it being, methinks, better than almost any room in my house.

1666-04-25 21:34   Home, and with my wife and Mercer spent our evening upon our new leads by our bedchamber singing, while Mrs. Mary Batelier looked out of the window to us, and we talked together, and at last bid good night.

1666-04-25 14:35   To the office, where Mr. Prin come; and till company come, did discourse with me a good while alone in the garden about the laws of England, telling me the many faults in them; and among others, their obscurity through multitude of long statutes.

1666-04-25 10:05   Home, and there find another little girl come from my wife’s mother, likely to do well.

1666-04-24 09:05   By and by comes Mr. Bland to me, the first time since his coming from Tangier, and tells me, in short, how all things are out of order there, and like to be; and the place never likely to come to anything while the soldiers govern all, and do not encourage trade.

1666-04-24 07:50   Up, and presently am told that the girl that came yesterday hath packed up her things to be gone home again to Enfield, whence she come, which I was glad of. The reason was that London do not agree with her. So I did give her something, and away she went.

1666-04-23 21:15   So to my accounts and journall at my chamber, there being bonfires in the street, for being St. George’s day, and the King’s Coronation, and the day of the Prince and Duke’s going to sea.

1666-04-23 17:42 r I am a little dissatisfied that the girl, though young, is taller and bigger than Su, and will not, I fear, be under her command, which will trouble me, and the more because she is recommended by a friend, but my wife do like very well of her.

1666-04-23 17:29   Home, and there find a girl sent at my desire by Mrs. Michell of Westminster Hall, to be my girl under the cooke-maid, Susan.

1666-04-23 15:50   I took Balty with me to Hales’s to show him his sister’s picture, and thence to Westminster, and there I to the Swan and drank, and so back again alone to Hales’s and there met my wife and Mercer, Mrs. Pierce being sitting. Her picture do come on well.

1666-04-23 11:40   I took coach and away home, in my way asking in two or three places the worth of pearls, I being now come to the time that I have long ago promised my wife a necklace.

1666-04-23 10:04   This morning the House of Parliament do meet, only to adjourne again till winter. The plague, I hear, encreases in the town much, and exceedingly in the country everywhere.

1666-04-22 21:50   I sat a great while with Will Joyce, who come to see me, and it is the first time I have seen him at my house since the plague, and find him the same impertinent, prating coxcomb that ever he was.

1666-04-22 17:15   I walked however to the Queen’s Chappell at St. James’s, and there saw a little mayd baptized; many parts and words whereof are the same with that of our Liturgy, and little that is more ceremonious than ours.

1666-04-22 16:04   I walked to White Hall, and there to and again in the Park, till being in the shoemaker’s stocks I was heartily weary.

1666-04-22 10:30   With Sir W. Batten in his coach home, in our way he telling me the certain news that the Bishopp of Munster has made a league with the Hollanders, and that our King and Court are displeased much at it: moreover we are not sure of Sweden.

1666-04-22 08:10   Up, and put on my new black coate, long down to my knees, and with Sir W. Batten to White Hall, where all in deep mourning for the Queen’s mother.

1666-04-21 17:50 r I was sorry to see my Lady Castlemaine, for the mourning forcing all the ladies to go in black, with their hair plain and without any spots, I find her to be a much more ordinary woman than ever I durst have thought she was.

1666-04-21 17:04   With my Lord Bruncker in his coach to Hide Parke, the first time I have been there this year.

1666-04-21 16:28   The King talked to us a little; and among other pretty things, he swore merrily that he believed the ketch that Sir W. Batten bought the last year at Colchester was of his own getting, it was so thick to its length.

1666-04-21 15:10   Home about three to clap a bit of meat in my mouth.

1666-04-20 15:05   To Paul’s Churchyard, and there bespoke some new books, and so to my ruling woman’s and there did see my work a doing.

1666-04-20 13:49   To Mr. Hales’s, and there, though against his particular mind, I had my landskip done out, and only a heaven made in the room of it, which though it do not please me thoroughly now it is done, yet it will do better than as it was before.

1666-04-20 12:14   I to the New Exchange, there to get a list of all the modern plays which I intend to collect and to have them bound up together.

1666-04-20 11:20   I met with Mrs. Martin, and she and I over the water to Stangate, and after a walk in the fields to the King’s Head, and there spent an hour or two with pleasure with her, and eat a tansy and so parted.

1666-04-20 07:05   Up, and after an hour or two’s talk with my poor wife, who gives me more and more content every day than other, I abroad by coach to Westminster.

1666-04-19 17:49 r My wife says she doubts my father is in want of money, for rents come in mighty slowly. My mother grows very unpleasant and troublesome and my father mighty infirm through his old distemper, which altogether makes me mighty thoughtful.

1666-04-19 17:39 r My wife tells me Pall’s business with Ensum is like to go on, but I must give, and she consents to it, another 100l.

1666-04-19 17:04   Anon comes home my wife from Brampton, which will hinder me of a little pleasure, but I am glad of her coming.

1666-04-19 15:05   To the office, and there met with the Commissioners of the Ordnance, where Sir W. Pen being almost drunk vexed me, and the more because Mr. Chichly observed it with me, and it was a disparagement to the office.

1666-04-18 21:08  Coming home called at my paper ruler’s and there found black Nan, which pleases me mightily, and having saluted her again and again away home and to bed – apres ayant tocado les mamelles de Mercer, que eran ouverts, con grand plaisir.

1666-04-18 16:32 r I left Jane sin hazer alguna cosa con ella, and to Mr. Hales, where he would have persuaded me to have had the landskip stand in my picture, but I like it not and will have it otherwise, which I perceive he do not like so well, however is so civil as to say it shall be altered.

1666-04-18 15:39   Toward King’s Street, and spying out of my coach Jane that lived heretofore at Jevons, my barber’s, I went further and stopped, and went on foot back, and overtook her, and spoke to her, and she telling me whither she was going I met her at Lambeth, and there drank with her.

1666-04-18 11:29   To the Exchange, that is, the New Exchange, and looked over some play books and intend to get all the late new plays.

1666-04-18 10:44   I went to the printed picture seller’s in the way to the Exchange, and there did see great plenty of fine prints; but did not buy any, only a print of an old pillar in Rome made for a Navall Triumph, which for the antiquity of the shape of ships, I buy and keep.

1666-04-18 09:18 r Here is the Prince’s, Sir G. Askue’s, Sir Thomas Teddiman’s, Sir Christopher Mings, Sir Joseph Jordan, Sir William Barkeley, Sir Thomas Allen, and Captain Harman’s, as also the Duke of Albemarle’s; and will be my Lord Sandwich’s, Sir W. Pen’s, and Sir Jeremy Smith’s.

1666-04-18 09:10   Sir W. Batten and Sir T. Allen and I to Mr. Lilly’s, the painter’s; and there saw the heads, some finished, and all begun, of the Flaggmen in the late great fight with the Duke of Yorke against the Dutch.

1666-04-17 21:30   I am told that Moll Davis, the pretty girl, that sang and danced so well at the Duke’s house, is dead.

1666-04-17 17:52 r However I reproached myself with my weakness in yielding so much my judgment to my sense, and prevailed with difficulty and did not budge, but stayed within, and, to my great content, did a great deal of business.

1666-04-17 17:50   To the office, where all the afternoon late, writing my letters and doing business, but, Lord! what a conflict I had with myself, my heart tempting me 1000 times to go abroad about some pleasure or other, notwithstanding the weather foule.

1666-04-17 12:55   Dined at home, my brother Balty with me, who is fitting himself to go to sea.

1666-04-16 19:29   I called for my papers and so home, and there comes Mrs. Turner and Mercer and supped with me, and well pleased I was with their company, but especially Mrs. Turner’s, she being a very pretty woman of person and her face pretty good, the colour of her hair very fine and light.

1666-04-16 17:05   To Westminster, thinking to have met Mrs. Martin, but could not find her, so back and called at Kirton’s to borrow 10s. to pay for my ruled papers, I having not money in my pocket enough to pay for them.

1666-04-15 21:07   To Mr. Pierce again; and he being gone forth, she and I and the children out by coach to Kensington, to where we were the other day, and with great pleasure stayed till night; and were mighty late getting home, the horses tiring and stopping at every twenty steps.

1666-04-15 13:14 r For certain Mrs. Stewart do do everything with the King that a mistress should do; and that the King hath many bastard children that are known and owned, besides the Duke of Monmouth.

1666-04-15 13:08   I walked to Mr. Pierces, and there dined, I alone with him and her and their children: very good company and good discourse, they being able to tell me all the businesses of the Court.

1666-04-15 09:42 r I do see very little difference between the degree of the ceremonies used by our people in the administration thereof, and that in the Roman church, saving that methought our Chapel was not so fine, nor the manner of doing it so glorious, as it was in the Queene’s chapel.

1666-04-15 09:38 r I staid till the King went down to receive the Sacrament, and stood in his closett with a great many others, and there saw him receive it, which I did never see the manner of before.

1666-04-15 09:08   To the Queen’s chapel, and there heard a good deal of their mass, and some of their musique, which is not so contemptible, I think, as our people would make it, it pleasing me very well.

1666-04-14 14:32   Sir H. Cholmley being gone and all these accounts cleared I shall be even with the King, so as to make a very clear and short account in a very few days, which pleases me very well.

1666-04-14 01:10   Comes Creed and with him till past one in the morning, evening his accounts till my head aked and I was fit for nothing, however, coming at last luckily to see through and settle all to my mind, it did please me mightily.

1666-04-13 12:15   Called upon an old woman in Pannier Ally to agree for ruling of some paper for me and she will do it pretty cheap.

1666-04-13 11:39 r We fell into discourse of my picture, and I am for his putting out the Landskipp, though he says it is very well done, yet I do judge it will be best without it, and so it shall be put out, and be made a plain sky like my wife’s picture, which will be very noble.

1666-04-13 11:28   To White Hall, to spend an hour in the galleries there among the pictures, Mr. Hales showing me the difference in the paintings, and when I come more and more to distinguish and observe the workmanship, I do not find so many good things as I thought there was.

1666-04-13 09:55   To Mr. Hales’s, where it is pretty strange to see that his second doing, I mean the second time of her sitting, is less like Mrs. Pierce than the first, and yet I am confident will be most like her, for he is so curious that I do not see how it is possible for him to mistake.

1666-04-13 08:10   Up, being called up by my wife’s brother, for whom I have got a commission from the Duke of Yorke for Muster-Master of one of the divisions, of which Harman is Rere-Admirall, of which I am glad as well as he.

1666-04-12 18:04   I to the office, where my Lord Bruncker come; and he and I had a little fray, he being, I find, a very peevish man, if he be denied what he expects.

1666-04-12 16:22   My Lady Pen comes to me and takes me into her house. I did stay talking and playing the fool almost all the afternoon, and there saw two or three foolish sorry pictures of her doing, but very ridiculous compared to what my wife do. She grows mighty homely and looks old.

1666-04-11 21:42   Home and did a great jobb at my Tangier accounts, which I find are mighty apt to run into confusion, my head also being too full of other businesses and pleasures.

1666-04-11 17:26   To Gresham College, where a great deal of do and formality in choosing of the Council and Officers. I had three votes to be of the Council, who am but a stranger, nor expected any.

1666-04-11 11:11   I to Hales’s, where there was nothing found to be done more to my picture, but the musique, which now pleases me mightily, it being painted true.

1666-04-11 09:20   To White Hall, having first set my people to work about setting me rails upon the leads of my wife’s closet, a thing I have long designed, but never had a fit opportunity till now.

1666-04-10 16:49   To the office again all the afternoon, where we sat all, the first time of our resolution to sit both forenoons and afternoons.

1666-04-09 19:58 r We went away (I for my part in great disorder) for Kensington, and there I spent about 30s. upon the jades with great pleasure, and we sang finely and staid till about eight at night, the night coming on apace.

1666-04-09 17:23   To Mrs. Pierce’s, and with her and Knipp and Mrs. Pierce’s boy and girl abroad, thinking to have been merry at Chelsey; but being come almost to the house by coach near the waterside, a gentleman walking by called to us to tell us that the house was shut up of the sickness.

1666-04-09 07:49   With my Joyner begun the making of the window in my boy’s chamber bigger, purposing it shall be a room to eat and for having musique in.

1666-04-08 22:15   Had Mercer comb my head and so to supper, sing a psalm, and to bed.

1666-04-08 10:20   The Court full this morning of the news of Tom Cheffin’s death, the King’s closet-keeper. He was well last night as ever, flaying at tables in the house, and not very ill this morning at six o’clock, yet dead before seven: they think, of an impostume in his breast.

1666-04-08 08:10   Up, and was in great trouble how to get a passage to White Hall, it raining, and no coach to be had. So I walked to the Old Swan, and there got a scull.

1666-04-07 22:12   W. Hewer comes to me to tell me that he has left my wife well this morning at Bugden, which was great riding, and brings me a letter from her. She is very well got thither, of which I am heartily glad.

1666-04-07 17:47 r I took them to the cakehouse, and there called in the coach for cakes and drank, and thence I carried them to my Lord Chancellor’s new house to shew them that, and all mightily pleased.

1666-04-07 15:22   Took Bab. Allen by coach to Hales’s, and there find Mrs. Pierce and her boy and Mary. She had done sitting the first time, and indeed her face is mighty like at first dash.

1666-04-07 14:10   With my Lord Bruncker home by coach to Mrs. Williams’s, where Bab. Allen and Dr. Charleton dined. Bab and I sang and were mighty merry as we could be there, where the rest of the company did not overplease.

1666-04-07 08:49   Lay pretty long to-day, lying alone and thinking of several businesses.

1666-04-06 20:32   This day great news of the Swedes declaring for us against the Dutch, and, so far as that, I believe it.

1666-04-06 19:12   I home, where all things, methinks, melancholy in the absence of my wife.

1666-04-06 17:03   To Mr. Hales and there sat, and my picture almost finished, which by the word of Mr. and Mrs. Pierce (who come in accidentally) is mighty like, and I am sure I am mightily pleased both in the thing and the posture.

1666-04-06 05:04   Up mighty betimes upon my wife’s going this day toward Brampton. I could not go to the coach with her, but W. Hewer did and hath leave from me to go the whole day’s journey with her.

1666-04-05 22:05   The plague is, to our great grief, increased nine this week, though decreased a few in the total. And this increase runs through many parishes, which makes us much fear the next year.

1666-04-05 22:04   I to the office all the afternoon till late, and so home and late putting notes to “It is decreed, nor shall thy fate, &c.” and then to bed.

1666-04-05 14:32   Home, where I find my wife hath on a sudden, upon notice of a coach going away to-morrow, taken a resolution of going in it to Brampton, we having lately thought it fit for her to go to satisfy herself and me in the nature of the fellow that is there proposed to my sister.

1666-04-05 13:27   Dining with my Lord Bruncker and his mistress with Captain Cocke, a good dinner, but the woman do tire me, and indeed how simply my Lord Bruncker, who is otherwise a wise man, do proceed at the table in serving of Cocke, would make a man think him a foole.

1666-04-05 10:05   To the office, where the falseness and impertinencies of Sir W. Pen would make a man mad to think of.

1666-04-05 08:44   To Lumbard Streete, and there at Viner’s was shown the silver plates, made for Captain Cocke to present my Lord Bruncker; and I chose a dozen of the same weight to be bespoke for myself, which he told me yesterday he would give me on the same occasion.

1666-04-04 22:16   After supper to bed, consulting how to send my wife into the country to advise about Pall’s marriage, which I much desire, and my father too, and two or three offers are now in hand.

1666-04-04 20:20   Abroad by coach to Hales’s, and there sat till night, mightily pleased with my picture, which is now almost finished.

1666-04-04 13:52   After done several businesses at the ’Change I home, and being washing day dined upon cold meat.

1666-04-04 08:50   With Sir W. Pen in his coach to White Hall, in his way talking simply and fondly as he used to do, but I find myself to slight him and his simple talk, I thank God, and that my condition will enable me to do it.

1666-04-03 22:28   Home and supped and to my accounts again till I was ready to sleep, there being no pleasure to handle them, if they are not kept in good order. So to bed.

1666-04-03 19:50   I to my accounts hard all the afternoon till it was quite dark, and I thank God I do come to bring them very fairly to make me worth 5,000l. stock in the world, which is a great mercy to me.

1666-04-02 22:32   Home, and to my accounts which I cannot get through with. But at it till I grew drowsy, and so to bed mightily vexed that I can come to no better issue in my accounts.

1666-04-02 17:12   To Westminster Hall, where I purposely took my wife well dressed into the Hall to see and be seen; and, among others, Howlet’s daughter, who is newly married, and is she I call wife, and one I love mightily.

1666-04-02 11:28   Sir W. Warren very wisely did show me that my matching my sister with Mr. Gawden would undo me in all my places, everybody suspecting me in all I do; and I shall neither be able to serve him, nor free myself from imputation of being of his faction.

1666-04-02 10:33   With Mr. Gawden in Westminster Hall, he and I to talk of his son Benjamin; and I propounded a match for him, and at last named my sister, which he embraces heartily. This did mightily rejoice me.

1666-04-02 09:40   With Mr. Gawden to Guildhall to see the bills and tallies there in the chamber (and by the way in the street his new coach broke and we fain to take an old hackney).

1666-04-01 22:45   Home, where to my accounts, and was at them till I could not hold open my eyes, and so to bed.

1666-04-01 16:43   I made a visit to my Lady Carteret, whom I understood newly come to town; and she took it mighty kindly, but I see her face and heart are dejected from the condition her husband’s matters stand in.

1666-04-01 14:58   With my uncle Wight and a gentleman he met with to my Lord Chancellor’s new house, and there viewed it again and again and up to the top and I like it as well as ever and think it a most noble house.

1666-04-01 10:32   The Queen, I hear, do not yet hear of the death of her mother, she being in a course of physic, that they dare not tell it her.

1666-04-01 10:10   To the Queen’s chapel; where I do not so dislike the music. Here I saw on a post an invitation to all good Catholics to pray for the soul of such a one departed this life.
