1666-05-31 20:04   To my accounts and settled them clear; but to my grief find myself poorer than I was the last by near 20l, by reason of my being forced to return 50l to Downing, the smith, which he had presented me with. However, I am well contented, finding myself yet to be worth 5200l.

1666-05-31 13:05   To dinner with my father and sister and family; and with a sparrow that our Mercer hath brought up now for three weeks, which is so tame that it flies up and down, and upon the table, and eats and pecks, and do everything so pleasantly, that we are mightily pleased with it.

1666-05-31 09:21   Saw all my family up, and my father and sister, who is a pretty good-bodied woman, and not over thicke, as I thought she would have been, but full of freckles, and not handsome in face.

1666-05-30 22:02   My wife tells me that Balty’s wife is brought to bed, by some fall or fit, before her time, of a great child, but dead. If the woman do well, we have no reason to be sorry, because his staying a little longer without a child will be better for him and her.

1666-05-30 21:58   To supper with my father, and mighty pleasant we were, and my wife mighty kind to him and Pall, and so after supper to bed, myself being sleepy, and my right eye still very sore, as it has been now about five days or six, which puts me out of tune.

1666-05-30 15:30   I abroad by appointment to my Lord Ashly, who, it is strange to see, how prettily he dissembles his favour to Yeabsly’s business, which none in the world could mistrust only I, that am privy to his being bribed.

1666-05-30 12:22 r I to them, and am heartily glad to see them, especially my father, who, poor man, looks very well, and hath rode up this journey on horseback very well, only his eyesight and hearing is very bad.

1666-05-30 11:47   Word is brought me that my father and my sister are come. I expected them to-day, but not so soon.

1666-05-29 21:22 r The difference among all between what they do now, and what it was the night when Monk come into the City. Such a night as that I never think to see again, nor think it can be.

1666-05-29 21:10 r Lord! to see the difference how many there were on the other side, and so few ours, the City side of the Temple, would make one wonder the difference between the temper of one sort of people and the other.

1666-05-29 20:50   Took coach, and so set Mrs. Horsely home, and then home ourselves, but with great trouble in the streets by bonefires, it being the King’s birth-day and day of Restoration.

1666-05-29 18:15 r Among other things, had a fellow that imitated all manner of birds, and dogs, and hogs, with his voice, which was mighty pleasant.

1666-05-29 17:04 r However I could not help it, but sent them before with Creed, and I did some of my business; and so after them, and find them there, in an arbour, and had met with Mrs. Pierce, and some company with her. So here I spent 20s upon them, and were pretty merry.

1666-05-29 15:42 r Lord! to see how my nature could not refrain from the temptation; but I must invite them to Foxhall, to Spring Gardens, though I had freshly received minutes of a great deal of extraordinary business.

1666-05-29 15:20   To my office, and thither my wife comes, to tell me that if I would see the handsomest woman in England, I shall come home presently; and who should it be but the pretty lady of our parish, that did heretofore sit on the other side of our church, over against our gallery.

1666-05-29 05:55   Waked with the ringing of the bells all over the town; so up before five o’clock, and to the office, where we met.

1666-05-28 21:55   To bed, my wife telling me where she hath been to-day with my aunt Wight, and seen Mrs. Margaret Wight, and says that she is one of the beautifulest women that ever she saw in her life, the most excellent nose and mouth.

1666-05-28 13:47   Home, where I find Mr. Lovett and his wife came to see us. They are a pretty couple, and she a fine bred woman. They dined with us, and Browne, the painter, and she plays finely on the lute. My wife and I were well pleased with her company.

1666-05-27 22:03   With my wife by and by by water as low as Greenwich, for ayre only, and so back again home to supper and to bed with great pleasure.

1666-05-27 09:30   To my office to write two copies of my Will fair, wherein I have given my sister Pall 500l, my father for his own and my mother’s support 2000l, to my wife the rest of my estate, but to have 2500l secured to her.

1666-05-26 22:15   To the office and despatched much business, to my great content, and so home to supper and to bed.

1666-05-25 22:05   Home, and (Knipp being gone) took out my wife and Mercer to take the ayre a little, and so as far as Hackney and back again, and then to bed.

1666-05-25 14:15   Home, and there find Knipp at dinner with my wife, now very big, and within a fortnight of lying down. But my head was full of business and so could have no sport.

1666-05-25 13:45   Mr. Browne of St. Mellos tells me the meaning of the setting out of dogs every night out of the town walls, which are said to secure the city; but it is not so, but only to secure the anchors, cables, and ships that lie dry, which might otherwise be liable to be robbed.

1666-05-25 11:32   Out to the ’Change to speak with Captain Cocke, who tells me my silver plates are ready for me, and shall be sent me speedily; and proposes another proposition of serving us with a thousand tons of hemp, and tells me it shall bring me 500l, if the bargain go forward.

1666-05-24 21:48   To bed, my right eye continuing very ill of the rheum, which hath troubled it four or five days.

1666-05-24 12:04   To the office, where busy all the morning. At noon rose in the pleasantest humour I have seen Sir W. Coventry and the whole board in this twelvemonth from a pleasant crossing humour Sir W. Batten was in, he being hungry, and desirous to be gone.

1666-05-23 22:12   Home to supper and to bed, having my right eye sore and full of humour of late, I think, by my late change of my brewer, and having of 8s. beer.

1666-05-23 19:10   I to Mrs. Pierces to take up my wife and Mercer, where I find her new picture by Hales do not please her, nor me indeed, it making no show, nor is very like, nor no good painting.

1666-05-23 17:35 r Sir G. Carteret advises me to stand on my guard; which I shall do, and unless my too-much addiction to pleasure undo me, will be acute enough for any of them.

1666-05-23 17:30   Sir G. Carteret giving me caution as to myself, that there are those that are my enemies as well as his, and by name my Lord Bruncker, who hath said some odd speeches against me.

1666-05-22 16:40   I to Lovett’s, and there staid by him and her and saw them (in their poor conditioned manner) lay on their varnish, which however pleased me mightily to see.

1666-05-21 21:50   Out with my wife, her brother, sister, and Mercer to Islington, our grand tour, and there eat and drank. I am infinitely pleased with Balty, his deportment in his business of Muster-Master, and hope mighty well from him, and am glad with all my heart I put him into this business.

1666-05-21 14:30   I away to my Lord Ashly, where it is stupendous to see how favourably, and yet closely, my Lord Ashly carries himself to Mr. Yeabsly, in his business, so as I think we shall do his business for him in very good manner.

1666-05-21 08:10   Lord! how it torments me to find myself so unable to give an account of my Victualling business, which puts me out of heart in everything else, so that I never had a greater shame upon me in my own mind, but I will get out of it as soon as possibly I can.

1666-05-20 20:00   I find my wife come home, much pleased with the reception she had, and she was godmother, and did hold the child at the Font, and it is called John.

1666-05-20 19:20   To Deptford, to enquire after a little business there, and thence by water back again, all the way coming and going reading my Lord Bacon’s “Faber Fortunae,” which I can never read too often, and so back home.

1666-05-20 17:57   I had discourse with Mr. Yeabsly, who hath this day presented my Lord Ashly with 100l. to bespeak his friendship to him in his accounts now before us; and my Lord hath received it, and so I believe is as bad, as to bribes, as what the world says of him.

1666-05-20 16:30   I out to Westminster, and straight to Mrs. Martin’s, and there did what I would with her, she staying at home all the day for me; and not being well pleased with her over free and loose company, I away to Westminster Abbey.

1666-05-20 14:22   After dinner my wife and Mercer by coach to Greenwich, to be gossip to Mrs. Daniel’s child.

1666-05-19 14:12 r Mr. Deane fell to explain to me his manner of casting the draught of water which a ship will draw before-hand: which is a secret all admire in him; and he is the first that hath come to any certainty, of foretelling the draught of water of a ship before she be launched.

1666-05-19 14:08   Took Mr. Deane home with me to dinner. We did fall to discourse about his ship “Rupert,” built by him, which succeeds so well as he hath got great honour by it, and I some by recommending him; the King, Duke, and everybody saying it is the best ship that was ever built.

1666-05-18 21:50   And so to bed, being not very well, having eaten too much lobster at noon at dinner with Mr. Hollyard, he coming in and commending it so much.

1666-05-18 12:04   To Westminster, and attended all the morning on the Exchequer for a quarter’s tallies for Tangier. But, Lord! to see what a dull, heavy sort of people they are there would make a man mad.

1666-05-17 22:14   Home to supper and to bed, mightily pleased with myself for the business that I have done, and convinced that if I would but keep constantly to do the same I might have leisure enough and yet do all my business, and by the grace of God so I will.

1666-05-17 17:05   To my office, where I could not hold my eyes open for an hour, but I drowsed (so little sensible I apprehend my soul is of the necessity of minding business), but I anon wakened and minded my business, and did a great deal with very great pleasure.

1666-05-16 22:05   I took my wife and Mrs. Barbary and Mercer out by coach and went our Grand Tour, and baited at Islington, and so late home about 11 at night, and so with much pleasure to bed.

1666-05-16 16:10   Lord! to see with what itching desire I did endeavour to see Bagwell’s wife, but failed, for which I am glad, only I observe the folly of my mind that cannot refrain from pleasure at a season above all others in my life requisite for me to shew my utmost care in.

1666-05-16 11:50 r I am very well satisfied in my pictures, and so took them in another coach home along with me, and there with great pleasure my wife and I hung them up.

1666-05-16 10:58   To Mr. Hales, and paid him for my picture, and Mr. Hill’s, for the first 14l. for the picture, and 25s. for the frame, and for the other 7l. for the picture, it being a copy of his only, and 5s. for the frame; in all, 22l. 10s.

1666-05-15 15:40   To my Lord Treasurer’s, and there my business was to be told that my Lord Treasurer hath got 10,000l. for us in the Navy, to answer our great necessities, which I did thank him for; but the sum is not considerable.

1666-05-14 21:55   I fell to examine my wife’s kitchen book, and find 20s. mistake, which made me mighty angry and great difference between us, and so in the difference to bed.

1666-05-14 19:20   Out with my wife and my aunt Wight, to take the ayre, and happened to have a pleasant race between our hackney-coach and a gentleman’s. At Bow we eat and drank and so back again, it being very cool.

1666-05-14 10:44   Toward Westminster with my wife by coach and meeting took up Mr. Lovett the varnisher with us, who is a pleasant speaking and humoured man, so my wife much taken with him, and a good deal of work I believe I shall procure him.

1666-05-14 09:30   I finding it a leisure day fell to making clean my closet in my office, which I did to my content and set up my Platts again, being much taken also with Griffin’s maid, that did clean it, being a pretty maid.

1666-05-13 12:15   Home, where comes Mr. Symons to dine with me, and I made myself as good company as I could to him, but he was mighty impertinent methought too yet, and thereby I see the difference between myself now and what it was heretofore, when I reckoned him a very brave fellow.

1666-05-12 21:55   The plague encreases in many places, and is 53 this week with us.

1666-05-12 20:30   This day come home again my little girle Susan, her sickness proving an ague, and she had a fit soon almost as she come home.

1666-05-12 13:40   Up to the putting our dining room in order, which will be clean again anon, but not as it is to be because of the pictures which are not come home.

1666-05-12 12:08 r This my wife took unkindly, and I think I was to blame indeed; but she do find with reason, that in the company of Pierce, Knipp, or other women that I love, I do not value her, or mind her as I ought.

1666-05-12 12:05   Home, where I find my wife troubled still at my checking her last night in the coach in her long stories out of Grand Cyrus, which she would tell, though nothing to the purpose, nor in any good manner.

1666-05-12 05:50   Up to the office very betimes to draw up a letter for the Duke of Yorke relating to him the badness of our condition in this office for want of money.

1666-05-11 21:48   Abroad with my wife and Mrs. Pierce, our long tour by coach, to Hackney, so to Kingsland, and then to Islington, there entertaining them by candlelight very well.

1666-05-11 10:55   Captain Cocke told me that my Lord Bruncker should say in his hearing, before Sir W. Batten, of me, that he could undo the man, if he would; wherein I think he is a foole; but, however, it is requisite I be prepared against the man’s friendship.

1666-05-10 22:10   So back again late, it being wondrous hot all the day and night and it lightning exceeding all the way we went and came, but without thunder.

1666-05-10 21:20 r Coming home we called at a little ale-house, and had an eele-pie, of which my wife eat part and brought home the rest.

1666-05-10 19:37 r Going out towards Hackney by coach for the ayre, the silly coachman carries us to Shoreditch, which was so pleasant a piece of simplicity in him and us, that made us mighty merry.

1666-05-10 18:43   Abroad with my wife by coach. We took with us Mrs. Turner, who was come to visit my wife just as we were going out. A great deal of tittle tattle discourse to little purpose, though in other things a very discreet woman, as very a gossip speaking of her neighbours as any body.

1666-05-09 22:20 r I rose and held my wife, she prays me to forgive her, and in mighty pain we put her to bed, where the pain ceased by and by, and so had some asparagus to our bed side for supper and very kindly afterward to sleep.

1666-05-09 21:32 r Half an hour after (my wife in the coach leaning on me as being desirous to be friends) she comes up mighty sick with a fit of the cholique and in mighty pain and calls for me out of the bed.

1666-05-09 20:59 r I left my company and went with my wife to Bow, but was vexed and spoke not one word to her all the way going nor coming, or being come home, but went up straight to bed.

1666-05-09 18:50 r Home, where my wife in mighty pain and mightily vexed at my being abroad with these women; and when they were gone called them whores and I know not what, which vexed me, having been so innocent with them.

1666-05-09 16:33   To Mrs Pierce’s, where I find Knipp, and I took them to Hales’s to see our pictures finished, which are very pretty, but I like not hers half so well as I thought at first, it being not so like, nor so well painted as I expected, or as mine and my wife’s are.

1666-05-09 08:58   By coach to White Hall, where we did our usual business before the Duke, and heard the Duke commend Deane’s ship “The Rupert” before “The Defyance,” built lately by Castle, in hearing of Sir W. Batten, which pleased me mightily.

1666-05-09 05:32   Up by five o’clock, which I have not a long time done, and down the river by water to Deptford, among other things to examine the state of Ironworke.

1666-05-08 22:39   To my office again late, and then home to supper to a good lobster with my wife, and then a little to my office again, and so to bed.

1666-05-08 15:10   To the office and thither comes Mr. Downing, the anchor-smith, who had given me 50 pieces in gold the last month to speak for him to Sir W. Coventry, for his being smith at Deptford; but he finds himself not fit to go on with it, so lets it fall.

1666-05-07 23:04   To the office, where busy till late at night and so weary and a little conscious of my failures to-day, yet proud that the day is over without more observation on Sir W. Coventry’s part, and so to bed and to sleep soundly.

1666-05-07 10:10   I went with Sir W. Coventry into the Victualling office, where we sat and examined his businesses and state of the victualling of the fleet, which made me in my heart blush that I could say no more to it than I did or could.

1666-05-06 20:45   Busy till night in fitting my Victualling papers in order, which I through my multitude of business and pleasure have not examined these several months.

1666-05-05 23:58   It being a fine moonshine my wife and Mercer come into the garden, and, my business being done, we sang, with mighty pleasure to ourselves and neighbours, by their casements opening, and so home to supper and to bed.

1666-05-04 21:10   Being weary of my late idle courses, and the little good I shall do the King or myself in the office, I bound myself to very strict rules till Whitsunday next.

1666-05-04 13:12   To dinner, and had a great fray with my wife again about Browne’s coming to teach her to paint, and sitting with me at table, which I will not yield to.

1666-05-04 09:33   To Mr. Hales, to see what he had done to Mrs. Pierces picture, and whatever he pretends, I do not think it will ever be so good a picture as my wife’s.

1666-05-03 19:22 r The mother come and with a nurse she has got, who demanded and I did agree at 10s. per week to take her, and so she away, and my house mighty uncouth, having so few in it.

1666-05-03 14:10 r I sent for the girl’s mother to Westminster Hall to me; she came and undertakes to get her daughter a lodging and nurse at next door to her, though she dare not, for the parish’s sake, whose sexton her husband is, to take her into her own house.

1666-05-03 13:15 r To send up and down for a nurse to take the girle home and would have given anything. I offered to the only one that we could get 20s. per week, and we to find clothes, and bedding and physique, and would have given 30s, as demanded, but desired an hour or two’s time.

1666-05-03 12:05   Home, and contrary to my expectation find my little girl Su worse than she was, which troubled me, and the more to see my wife minding her painting and not thinking of her house business.

1666-05-02 12:50   I home to dinner, find the girl yet better, so no fear of being forced to send her out of doors as we intended.

1666-05-02 10:04   To my office, to consult about serving Captain Cocke in getting him some money, he being already tired of his slavery to my Lord Bruncker, and the charge it costs him, and gets no manner of courtesy from him for it.

1666-05-01 19:59   My wife tells me the ill news that our Susan is sick and gone to bed, with great pain in her head and back, which troubles us all. However we to bed expecting what to-morrow would produce. She hath we conceive wrought a little too much, having neither maid nor girl to help her.

1666-05-01 15:50   By water to Redriffe, reading a new French book my Lord Bruncker did give me to-day, “L’Histoire Amoureuse des Gaules,” being a pretty libel against the amours of the Court of France.

1666-05-01 12:41 r However, I did bring him to incline towards it, if he be pressed to take it. I do think it may be some repute to me to have my kinsman in Commission there, specially if he behave himself to content in the country.

1666-05-01 12:39 r Nor do he understand Latin, and so is not capable of the place as formerly, now all warrants do run in Latin. Nor is he in Kent, though he be of Deptford parish, his house standing in Surry.

1666-05-01 12:35   My cozen Thomas Pepys did come to me, to consult about the business of his being a justice of the Peace, which he is much against; and among other reasons, tells me, that he is not free to exercise punishment according to the Act against Quakers and other people, for religion.
