1664-10-31 22:27   Vexed for my being so angry in bad words to my wife to-night, she not giving me a good account of her layings out to my mind.

1664-10-30 07:44   Put on my new, fine, coloured cloth suit, with my cloake lined with plush, which is a dear and noble suit, costing me about 17l.

1664-10-29 20:10   The talke is that De Ruyter is come over-land home with his captaines to command here at home, and their ships kept abroad in the Straights.

1664-10-29 08:45   It being my Lord Mayor’s show, my boy and three mayds went out; but it being a very foule, rainy day, I was sorry my wife let them go out.

1664-10-28 12:34   To Nellson’s, and there bought 20 pieces more of Bewpers, and hope to go on with him to a contract.

1664-10-28 08:50   My tailor brings me home my fine, new, coloured cloth suit, my cloake lined with plush, as good a suit as ever I wore in my life.

1664-10-28 06:37   Slept ill all night, having got a very great cold the other day at Woolwich in my head, which makes me full of snot.

1664-10-27 13:50   A good plain dinner, but I expected musique, the missing of which spoiled my dinner, only very good merry discourse at dinner.

1664-10-27 13:47   Sir G. Carteret, Sir J. Minnes, Sir W. Batten, Sir W. Pen, and myself, were treated at the Dolphin by Mr. Foly, the ironmonger.

1664-10-26 21:58   It seems the City did last night very freely lend the King 100,000l. without any security but the King’s word, which was very noble.

1664-10-26 20:40   By and by my wife and her company come in all well, at which I was glad, though angry.

1664-10-26 20:05   Home, where the little girle hath looked to the house well, but no wife come home, which made me begin to fear, the water being very rough.

1664-10-26 19:30   The constable standing there to keep people from the hole, I was catched up, otherwise I had broke my leg.

1664-10-26 19:29   I fair to go through the darke and dirt over the bridge, and my leg fell in a hole broke on the bridge.

1664-10-26 19:15   Finding Sir W. Batten’s coach, heard they were gone into the Beare at the Bridge foot, and thither I to them.

1664-10-26 18:55   Dark when we came to London, and a stop of coaches in Southwarke. I staid above half an houre and then ‘light.

1664-10-26 12:04   I sent for Mr. Pett, and put the flaggon into the Duke’s hand, and he, in the presence of the King, did give it.

1664-10-26 11:38   I staid with the King and Duke while the ship was launched, which was done with great success, and the King did very much like the ship.

1664-10-26 09:20   I took a hackney-coach I hired, it being a very cold and foule day, to Woolwich, all the way reading in a good book touching the fishery.

1664-10-26 08:07   My wife, she and her woman, and Besse and Jane, and W. Hewer and the boy, to the water-side, and there took boat.

1664-10-26 07:15   My boy, he could not sleep, but wakes about four o’clock, and in bed lay playing on his lute till daylight.

1664-10-25 22:07   To bed, my house being full of a design, to go to-morrow, my wife and all her servants, to see the new ship launched.

1664-10-25 17:07   Mr. Christopher Pett do acknowledge to me that he did never receive so great a kindness from any man in the world as from me herein.

1664-10-25 17:05   Home, in my way taking care of a piece of plate for Mr. Christopher Pett, against the launching of his new great ship tomorrow at Woolwich.

1664-10-25 15:50   I did make my report of the public collections for the Fishery, much to the satisfaction of the Committee, and much to my reputation.

1664-10-24 16:20   The Prince tell of the danger he and his fleete lie in at Portsmouth, of receiving affronts from the Dutch.

1664-10-23 17:49   Mr. Cooper and I, with one I judge come from sea, spent the whole afternoon together, he teaching me some things in understanding of plats.

1664-10-22 12:02   Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning.

1664-10-21 19:30   Comes Mr. Martin, to trouble me to get him a Lieutenant’s place for which he is as fit as a foole can be. But I put him off like an arse.

1664-10-21 09:23   It will cost me money, but I find that I must go handsomely, whatever it costs me, and the charge will be made up in the fruit it brings.

1664-10-21 09:22   To Sir W. Turner’s, and there bought my cloth, coloured, for a suit and cloake, to line with plush the cloak.

1664-10-20 14:10   I to my office with Bagwell’s wife, and I caressed her, and find her more and more coming with promises of getting her husband a place.

1664-10-19 20:14   My wife at Mercer’s mother’s, W. Hewer with them, which I do not like, that he should go about business, and then spend his time in sport.

1664-10-18 21:28   The Prince is with his fleet at Portsmouth, and the Dutch are making all preparations for warr.

1664-10-18 16:55   At Somersett House Mr. Gray carried me in, and there I saw the Queene’s new rooms, which are most stately and nobly furnished.

1664-10-18 15:47   Sir Ellis Layton is, for a speech of forty words, the wittiest man that ever Mr. Gray knew, but longer he is nothing.

1664-10-18 15:36   I find Mr Gray a worthy and studious gentleman, and he observed how it is not the greatest wits, but the steady man that is a good merchant.

1664-10-17 14:15   With Sir W. Warren to a cook’s shop and dined, and do every day receive great satisfaction in his company.

1664-10-17 11:50   I saw Sir J. Lawson since his return from sea first this morning, and hear that my Lord Sandwich is come from Portsmouth to town.

1664-10-16 21:47   Home, parting company at my cozen Anth. Joyce’s, by four o’clock, weary, but very well, to bed at home, where I find all well.

1664-10-16 13:38   Staid not in the Church, but thence mounted again and to Barnett by the end of sermon, and there dined at the Red Lyon very weary again.

1664-10-16 09:04   Got to Hatfield in church-time; and I ‘light and saw my simple Lord Salsbury sit there in his gallery.

1664-10-15 22:12   I find that eating after I come to my Inne, without drinking, do keep me from being stomach sick, which drink do presently make me.

1664-10-15 21:58   I weary, which proceeded from our galloping so much; but I find that a coney skin in my breeches preserves me perfectly from galling.

1664-10-15 19:07   Taking leave, W. Joyce and I set out, calling T. Trice at Bugden, and thence got by night to Stevenage, and there mighty merry.

1664-10-15 10:20   My mother all to no purpose desiring me to be friends with John, but I told her I cannot, nor indeed shall, which afflicted the poor woman.

1664-10-15 07:48   My father and I up and walked alone to Hinchingbroke; and saw the water-works and the Oral which is very fine; and so is the house all over.

1664-10-14 21:58   Home, where W. Joyce full of talk and pleased with his journey, and after supper I to bed and left my father, mother, and him laughing.

1664-10-14 17:50   My father and I to the Court, and did all our business to my mind, as I have set down in a paper particularly expressing our proceedings.

1664-10-14 15:32   Got to Brampton by three o’clock, where my father and mother overjoyed to see me, my mother, ready to weepe every time she looked upon me.

1664-10-13 21:10   Very merrily rode till it was darke, I leading the way through the darke to Welling, and there, not being very weary, to supper and to bed.

1664-10-13 15:10   To the Red Lyon in Aldersgate Street, and there met W. Joyce and Tom Trice, and mounted, I upon a fine mare that Sir W. Warren helps me to.

1664-10-13 14:14   I home and dined, and taking leave of my wife with my mind not a little troubled how she would look after herself or house in my absence.

1664-10-12 22:15   At my office late doing business against my journey to clear my hands of every thing for two days.

1664-10-12 12:52   All say De Ruyter is gone to Guinny before us. Sir J. Lawson is come to Portsmouth; and our fleete is hastening all speed.

1664-10-11 21:47   My wife tells me the sad news of my Lady Castlemayne’s being now become so decayed, that one would not know her; at least far from a beauty.

1664-10-11 16:07   To Will Joyce to get him to go to Brampton with me, but he will not, and I am not sorry, for his company both chargeable and troublesome.

1664-10-11 13:32   Luellin tells me what a bawdy play this “Parson’s Wedding” is, that is acted by nothing but women at the King’s house, and I am glad of it.

1664-10-10 21:12   Bless God for our long lives and loves and health together, which the same God long continue, I wish, from my very heart!

1664-10-10 21:10   This day my wife and I have been married nine years: but my head being full of business I did not keep it in any extraordinary manner.

1664-10-10 11:50   Sir W. Batten did discover the reason of Sir J. Minnes’ so long discontent with him, and now they are friends again, which I am sorry for.

1664-10-10 09:30   More preparations every day appear against the Dutch, and (which do a little move my envy) Sir W. Pen do grow more regarded by the Duke.

1664-10-09 19:40   My aunt and uncle in a very ill humour one with another, but I made shift with much ado to keep them from scolding.

1664-10-09 15:15   To church, and there staid to gaze upon a pretty lady, and dogged her home, and I think her to be one of the prettiest women I ever saw.

1664-10-08 23:58   Arguing about the freight of Captain Tayler’s ship, and at last we made an end, and I hope to get a little money, some small matter by it.

1664-10-08 14:20   I contracted with Mr. Bridges for 100 pieces of Callico to make flaggs; I shall save the King money, so I hope to get a little for my pains.

1664-10-07 17:07   Mr. Cocker brought me a globe of glasse, and a frame of oyled paper, as I desired, to show me the manner of his gaining light to grave by.

1664-10-07 15:10   Abroad to look after callicos for flags, and hope to get a small matter by my pains therein and yet save the King a great deal of money.

1664-10-07 07:40   Lay with some discontent abed, even to the having bad words with my wife, and blows too, about the ill-serving up of our victuals yesterday.

1664-10-06 11:28   To the office, where busy, among other things about this of the flags and my bringing in of callicos to oppose Young and Whistler.

1664-10-05 18:10   After three hours’ stay the Arched Viall could not be fixed in tune; and so they were fain to go to some other musique of instruments.

1664-10-05 15:30   The new instrument was brought called the Arched Viall, where being tuned with lute-strings, and played on with kees like an organ.

1664-10-05 15:15   To the Musique-meeting at the Postoffice. And thither anon come all the Gresham College, and a great deal of noble company.

1664-10-05 14:40   I discoursed with Mr. Cocker about his ability of sight, and how I shall do to get some glasse or other to helpe my eyes by candlelight.

1664-10-05 09:25   I did with pleasure see the many pretty works, and the little children employed, every one to do something, which was a very fine sight.

1664-10-05 09:15   By coach to New Bridewell to meet with Mr Poyntz to discourse with him (being Master of the Workhouse there) about making of Bewpers for us.

1664-10-04 17:20   To-morrow they told us should be acted, or the day after, a new play, called “The Parson’s Dreame,” acted all by women.

1664-10-04 17:15   I home with my wife and Mercer, vexed at my losing my time and above 20s. in money, and neglecting my business to see so bad a play.

1664-10-04 16:41   I happened to sit near to Sir Charles Sidly; and he did at every line take notice of the dullness of the poet and badness of the action.

1664-10-04 16:38   To a play, to see “The Generall;” which is so dull and so ill-acted, that I think it is the worst I ever saw or heard in all my days.

1664-10-04 11:47   Sir W. Pen went to Chatham to look after the ships now going out thence, and particularly that wherein the Duke and himself go.

1664-10-03 16:57   We made an experiment of Holland’s and our cordage, and ours outdid it a great deale, as my book of observations tells particularly.

1664-10-03 12:18   Bagwell’s wife rebuked me for kissing her, saying that did I do so much to many bodies else it would be a stain to me.

1664-10-03 12:15   Meeting Bagwell’s wife at the office before I went home I took her into the office and there kissed her only.

1664-10-03 08:49   Talke of great haste in the getting out another fleete; it is likely we have put one another by each other’s dalliance past a retreate.

1664-10-03 08:28   Up with Sir J. Minnes, by coach, to St. James’s; and there all the newes now of very hot preparations for the Dutch.

1664-10-02 16:04   I walked home, and there my wife was angry with me for not coming home, and for gadding abroad to look after beauties, she told me plainly.

1664-10-02 11:50   I walked to my Lady Sandwich’s, through my Lord Southampton’s new buildings in the fields behind Gray’s Inn; and they are a noble work.

1664-10-02 09:15   The fair Butler is a beauty I do admire myself for my choice of her for a beauty, having the best lower part of her face that ever I saw.

1664-10-02 09:10   To Clerkenwell church, and there, as I wished, sat next pew to the fair Butler, who indeed is a most perfect beauty still.

1664-10-01 20:37   We go now on in preparing against the Dutch, who will fall upon us without doubt upon this newes of our beating them so wholly in Guinny.

1664-10-01 09:54   I sent Mrs. Lane an answer that I would see her at Westminster, and so I did not go, and she went away, poor soul.

1664-10-01 09:50   Mrs. Lane (now Martin) like a foolish woman, sent for me while I was at the office, I know to get me to do something for her husband.
