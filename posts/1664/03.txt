1664-03-31 22:15   It troubles me that nobody else but I should bend themselves to serve the King with diligence, whereby much of my pains proves ineffectual.

1664-03-31 21:37   After supper to the making up my monthly accounts, and to my great content find myself worth above 900l, the greatest sum I ever yet had.

1664-03-31 10:03   We rose and parted, both of us angry, but I contented, because I knew all of them must know I was in the right.

1664-03-31 09:42   We went through my Lord Peterborough’s accounts, but with great difficulty, and many high words between Mr. Povy and I.

1664-03-30 14:30   Homewards, staying a pretty while with my little she milliner at the end of Birchin Lane, talking and buying gloves of her.

1664-03-30 13:22   To the ‘Change a great while, and had good discourse with Captain Cocke at the Coffee-house about a Dutch war.

1664-03-30 10:10   My Lady Carteret made us drink our morning draft of several wines, but I drank nothing but some of her coffee, which was poorly made.

1664-03-29 14:21   At Sir G. Carteret’s is hung up a picture of my Lady Carteret, drawn by Lilly, a fine picture, but not so good as I have seen of his doing.

1664-03-28 20:10   Mr Norman showed me a design for the storekeeper’s books, for the keeping of them regular in order to a balance which I am satisfied to see.

1664-03-28 06:03   This is the first morning that I have begun, and I hope shall continue to rise betimes in the morning, and so up and to my office.

1664-03-27 19:41   Talking of my wife’s clothes against Easter and about her mayds, Jane being to be gone, and whether Besse should be chamber-mayde or no.

1664-03-27 17:15   The drums beating as if an enemy were upon them; so much is this city subject to be put into a disarray upon very small occasions.

1664-03-27 17:10   In Cheapside it was full of apprentices, who have done violence, I think, to the master of the boys that were put in the pillory yesterday.

1664-03-27 15:42   Walked to St. James’s, to try if I could see the belle Butler, but could not; only her sister, who indeed is pretty, with a fine Roman nose.

1664-03-27 07:24   Wrangling with my wife about the charge she puts me to for clothes more than I intended, and very angry we were, but quickly friends again.

1664-03-26 22:10   Ended the day with great content to think how it hath pleased the Lord to raise me to a state of constant health almost, honour and plenty.

1664-03-26 14:58   The Lord Mayor and Major Generall Browne was fain to come; and drums was beat to raise the trained bands, for to quiett the towne.

1664-03-26 14:55   Upon occasion of some ’prentices being put in the pillory to-day for beating of their masters, ‘prentices came and pulled down the pillory.

1664-03-26 12:16   This being my solemn feast for my cutting of the stone, it being now, blessed be God! this day six years since the time.

1664-03-26 12:14   Home, and there found Madam Turner, her daughter The, Joyce Norton, my father and Mr. Honywood, and by and by come my uncle Wight and aunt.

1664-03-26 10:54   Sir W. Rider said that he hath kept a journals of his life for almost these forty years, and still do, which pleases me mightily.

1664-03-26 08:32   Lord! to see how ridiculous Mr. Povy is in all he says or do; like a man not more fit for to be in such employments as he is.

1664-03-25 17:44   Home with my wife, it being very dirty on foot, and bought some fowl in Gracious Street and some oysters against our feast to-morrow.

1664-03-25 16:32   Tom used to trust his servants with cutting out of clothes, never hardly cutting out anything himself. We find him to owe above 290l.

1664-03-25 16:21   With my wife to see my father and discourse how he finds Tom’s matters, which he do very ill.

1664-03-25 10:20   It was the worst sermon I ever heard Dr. Critton make, I must confess; and yet it was good, and in two places very bitter.

1664-03-25 09:15   Up and by water to White Hall, and there to chappell; where it was most infinite full to hear Dr. Critton.

1664-03-24 14:10   And so to Deptford and did the like there, and then walked to Redriffe (calling and eating a bit of collops and eggs at Half-way house).

1664-03-24 09:33   I down by water to Greenwich, it being very foggy, and I walked very finely to Woolwich, and there did very much business at both yards.

1664-03-23 14:20   There are but two seamen in the Parliament house, and not above twenty or thirty merchants; which is a strange thing in an island.

1664-03-23 13:57   To the Trinity House and there dined well: and good discourse among the old men of Islands now and then rising and falling again in the Sea.

1664-03-23 08:03   I took Mrs Buggin’s dog and the bitch into my closet below, and by holding down the bitch helped him to lime her, which he did very stoutly.

1664-03-22 20:32   I found the little dog so little that he could not reach our bitch, which I am sorry for, for it is the finest dog that ever I saw.

1664-03-22 18:07   My wife had got Mrs. Buggin’s little dog and our little bitch, which is proud at this time, and I think she was helping him to lime her.

1664-03-21 16:22   The King made a speech to the Houses of Parliament, discoursing largely of the plots abroad against him and the peace of the kingdom.

1664-03-21 06:45   Up, and it snowing this morning, which from the mildness of the winter and the weather beginning to be hot, is a little strange to us.

1664-03-20 22:22   To my chamber with a fire looking over my brother Thomas’s papers, among which I find base letters of my brother John’s to him against me.

1664-03-20 12:10   I am sorry to hear my wife talk of her being and resolving to die a Catholique, and indeed a small matter would absolutely turn her.

1664-03-20 11:57   Kept my bed all the morning, having laid a poultice to my cods last night to take down the tumour there which I got yesterday.

1664-03-19 20:52   I in great pain by a simple compressing of my cods to-day by putting one leg over another as I have formerly done.

1664-03-19 19:30   My father and my brother John came to towne by coach. I sat with him, giving him an account of things. He, poor man, very sad and sickly.

1664-03-19 17:07   By coach to my brother’s, where I spent the afternoon in paying some of the charges of the buriall, and in looking over his papers.

1664-03-19 13:23   To the office, where all the morning, and at noon my wife and I alone, having a good hen, with eggs, to dinner, with great content.

1664-03-18 19:40   At the sight of him dead and dying, I had real grief for a while, yet presently after, I have had very little grief indeed for him.

1664-03-18 19:37   But, Lord! to see how the world makes nothing of the memory of a man, an houre after he is dead!

1664-03-18 19:12   To my brother’s, and fell to a barrell of oysters, cake, and cheese, of Mr. Honiwood’s, being too merry for so late a sad work.

1664-03-18 18:20   Being come to the grave Dr. Pierson, the minister, did read the service for buriall: and so I saw my poor brother laid into the grave.

1664-03-18 17:47   Anon to church, walking out into the streete to the Conduit, and so across the streete, and had a very good company along with the corps.

1664-03-18 17:12   I am beholden to Mrs. Holden, who was most kind, and did take mighty pains not only in getting the house and every thing else ready.

1664-03-18 17:07   My cosen Joyce Norton kept the wine and cakes above; and did give out to them that served, who had white gloves given them.

1664-03-18 17:05   Their service was six biscuits apiece, and what they pleased of burnt claret.

1664-03-18 16:55   One after another they come, many more than I bid: That I bid was one hundred and twenty; I believe there was nearer one hundred and fifty.

1664-03-18 16:50   To my brother’s again: whither, though invited, as the custom is, at one or two o’clock, they came not till four or five.

1664-03-18 11:00   He would do my brother all the civility he can; which was to disturb other corps that are not quite rotten, to make room for him.

1664-03-18 10:58   To see how a man’s tombes are at the mercy of such a fellow, that for sixpence, “I will justle them together but I will make room for him.”

1664-03-18 10:48   To my brother’s and to church, and with the grave-maker chose a place for my brother to lie in, just under my mother’s pew.

1664-03-18 09:23   To Madam Turner’s and eat a breakfast there, and so to Wotton, my shoemaker, and there got a pair of shoes blacked on the soles.

1664-03-17 21:57   Home by coach, bringing my brother’s silver tankard for safety along with me, and so to supper, after writing to my father, and so to bed.

1664-03-17 19:42   I altered my resolution of burying him in the churchyard among my brothers and sisters, and bury him in the church near to my mother’s pew.

1664-03-17 12:10   Up and to my brother’s, where all the morning doing business against to-morrow, and so to my cozen Stradwicke’s about the same business.

1664-03-16 19:42   To my office, but God knows my heart and head is so full of my brother’s death, and the consequences, that I can do little or understand it.

1664-03-16 17:37   I have a barrel of oysters given me by Mr. Barrow, as big as 16 of others, and I took it in the coach to Mrs. Turner’s and give them to her.

1664-03-16 15:20   To my brother’s to look after things, and saw the coffin brought; and by and by Mrs. Holden came and saw him nailed up.

1664-03-16 13:55   My wife having those upon her today and in great pain we were forced to rise, and in Mrs Turner’s coach carried her home and put her to bed.

1664-03-16 13:15   To the ‘Change, and told my uncle Wight of my brother’s death, and so by coach to my cozen Turner’s and there dined very well.

1664-03-16 08:55   To my brother’s, where I set them on cleaning the house, I to my cozen Stradwicke’s and uncle Fenner’s about discoursing for the funeral.

1664-03-15 23:10   We up to bed, my wife and I in the little blue chamber, and I lay close to my wife, being full of disorder and grief for my brother.

1664-03-15 22:02   And so this was the end of my poor brother, talking idle and his lips working even to his last that his phlegm hindered his breathing.

1664-03-15 21:41   Mrs. Croxton, Holden, and the rest did strip and lay my brother out, they observing his corpse to be as clear as any they ever saw.

1664-03-15 20:52   It was a most sad sight to see the poor wretch lie now still and dead, and pale like a stone.

1664-03-15 20:35   I found the nurse holding my brother’s eyes shut, he a most sad sight, and that which put me into a present very great transport of grief.

1664-03-15 20:23   I led Mrs. Turner home, but before I came back, which was in half a quarter of an hour, my brother was dead.

1664-03-15 20:04   My brother began to fetch his spittle with more pain, till at last the phlegm getting the mastery of him, and he beginning to rattle.

1664-03-15 14:32   To my brother’s, where contrary to my expectation he continues as bad, talking idle, and now not at all knowing any of us as before.

1664-03-15 12:52   I sent for a barrel of oysters, and dined, and we were very merry, I being willing to be so upon this news.

1664-03-15 12:10   Dr Wiverly did talk with my brother, and he did wholly disclaim that ever he had the pox, or that ever he said to Mr. Powell that he had it.

1664-03-14 19:14   My brother talks no sense two words together now; and I confess it made me weepe to see that he should not be able to say who I was.

1664-03-14 14:24   My wife tells me in spiteful manner like a vixen, with a look full of rancour, she would buy a new dress and lace it and make me pay for it.

1664-03-14 14:08   At this my wife flounced away in a manner I never saw her, nor which I could ever endure.

1664-03-14 14:07   My wife and I fell out about my not being willing to have her gowne laced, but would lay out the same money and more on a plain new one.

1664-03-14 08:55   Upon the whole I do find my brother is, whether he lives or dies, a ruined man, and what trouble will befall me by it I know not.

1664-03-14 08:32   The mayde tells me many passages of her master’s practices, and how she concludes that he has run behind hand a great while and owes money.

1664-03-14 08:20   Up, and walked to my brother’s, where I find he hath continued talking idly all night, and now knows me not; which troubles me mightily.

1664-03-13 17:32   I walked home greatly troubled to think of my brother’s condition, and the trouble that would arise to me by his death or continuing sick.

1664-03-13 16:28   My brother Tom could only say that he knew me and then fell to other discourse, his face like a dying man, which Mrs Turner concludes he is.

1664-03-13 15:45   What is worst that my brother’s disease is the pox, which he hath heretofore got, and hath not been cured, but is come to this.

1664-03-13 15:42   Comes Mrs. Turner’s boy with a note to me to tell me that my brother Tom was so ill as they feared he would not long live.

1664-03-13 11:57   To my office, and there all the morning reading some Common Law, to which I will allot a little time now and then, for I much want it.

1664-03-12 16:22   Meeting Mr Stacy with some company of pretty women, I took him to a room by ourselves, and talked with him about the several sorts of tarrs.

1664-03-12 11:17   Vexed to see how Sir J. Minnes deserves rather to be pitied for his dotage than employed at a great salary to ruin the King’s business.

1664-03-11 22:15   Home to supper and to bed, hoping in God that my diligence, as it is really very useful for the King, so it will end in profit to myself.

1664-03-11 10:34   I find by discourse Mr. Moore to be grown rich, and indeed not to use me at all with the respect he used to do, but as his equal.

1664-03-10 15:35   Several persons, to the number of thirty-two, made the Duke’s assistants for their lives: whereof, by my Lord Sandwich’s favour, I am one.

1664-03-10 15:33   I found the Bill come for the Corporation of the Royall Fishery; whereof the Duke of Yorke is made present Governor.

1664-03-10 13:48   Home to dinner with my wife, to a good hog’s harslet, a piece of meat I love, but have not eat of I think these seven years.

1664-03-09 10:15   At my office finishing all things about Mr. Wood’s contract for masts, wherein I am sure I shall save the King 400l. before I have done.

1664-03-08 17:24   After good consultation and resolution of paying my forfeit, I do not find myself apprehensive that I have done any violence to my oaths.

1664-03-08 17:23   My conscience knows that it is only the saving of money and the time also that I intend by my oaths, and this has cost no more of either.

1664-03-08 17:22   We did walk home on purpose to make this going as cheap as that would have been, to have seen a play at Court.

1664-03-08 15:04   Though not exactly agreeing with the letter of my vowe, yet altogether with the sense, by going hither instead of that at Court.

1664-03-08 15:03   “Heraclius” being acted, which my wife and I have a mighty mind to see, we do resolve to see another this month.

1664-03-08 07:07   My wife was put upon puppy-dog water by a desire of my aunt Wight, who hath a mind, unknown to her husband, to get some for her ugly face.

1664-03-08 07:06   Up with some little discontent with my wife upon her saying that she had got and used some puppy-dog water.

1664-03-07 22:10   To bed, my cold being pretty well gone, but my eye remaining still snare and rhumey, which I wonder at, my right eye ayling nothing.

1664-03-07 17:40   It was pleasant to hear a lady hard by us, that did not know my Lady Castlemayne, say, being told who she was, that “she was well enough.”

1664-03-07 17:32   To the Duke’s house, where we saw “The Unfortunate Lovers;” but I was not much pleased with it, though I know not where to lay the fault.

1664-03-07 13:47   The Duke being gone abroad to-day, as we heard by a messenger, I spent the morning at my office writing fair my yesterday’s work.

1664-03-06 19:42   Sat all day in my closet at the office drawing up a second letter to Mr. Coventry about the measure of masts to my great satisfaction.

1664-03-05 21:22   My eye and my throat being very bad, and my cold increasing so as I could not speak almost. So home to supper, that is a posset, and to bed.

1664-03-05 09:52   To the office, where, though I had a great cold, I was forced to speak much upon a publique meeting of the East India Company.

1664-03-04 22:08   To bed, having a cold in my head and throat tonight from my late cutting my hair so close to my head, but I hope it will be soon gone again.

1664-03-04 15:32   I never had so much discourse with the Duke before, and till now did ever fear to meet him.

1664-03-04 15:19   Being met by the Duke of Yorke, he called me to him and discoursed a while with me about the new ship’s dispatch building at Woolwich.

1664-03-04 12:04   At Greenwich did observe the foundation laying of a very great house for the King, which will cost a great deale of money.

1664-03-04 09:18   There were several people by, trying a new-fashion gun brought my Lord, to shoot off often, one after another, without danger, very pretty.

1664-03-04 09:10   My Lord is concerned for the inconvenience upon my Lord Peterborough’s ill-stating of his matters, so as to have his gaine discovered.

1664-03-04 08:57   Up, my eye being pretty well, and then by coach to my Lord Sandwich, with whom I spoke, walking a good while with him in his garden.

1664-03-03 20:04   Home, being unwilling to stay late because of my eye which is not yet well of the rheum that is fallen down into it.

1664-03-03 14:54   But, Lord! to see how impatient I found myself within to see a play, I being at liberty once a month to see one.

1664-03-03 14:52   My wife and I out of doors thinking to have gone to have seen a play, but when we came to take coach, they tell us there are none this week.

1664-03-03 11:46   W. Howe assuring me of my Lord’s speaking so highly in my commendation to my Lord Peterborough and Povy.

1664-03-02 17:22   This afternoon we had a good present of tongues and bacon from Mr. Shales, of Portsmouth.

1664-03-02 11:32   Mr. Burgby finds things go very bad every where; and even in the Council nobody minds the publique.

1664-03-02 10:04   At St. Paul’s Churchyarde looked upon a pretty burlesque poem, called “Scarronides, or Virgile Travesty;” extraordinary good.

1664-03-02 06:55   Up, my eye mightily out of order with the rheum that is fallen down into it.

1664-03-01 22:39   I to my office, where late about getting myself a thorough understanding in the business of masts.

1664-03-01 20:02   Walked home by moonshine, it being mighty pleasant.

1664-03-01 14:56   I took Mr. Creed and my wife and down to Deptford, it being most pleasant weather.

1664-03-01 10:45   My uncle Wight told me how Mr. Maes had like to have been trapanned yesterday, but was forced to run for it.
