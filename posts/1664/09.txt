1664-09-30 17:50   I have this weeke, notwithstanding great layings out, my balance to come to 1203l, for which the Lord’s name be praised!

1664-09-30 17:47   All day, both morning and afternoon, at my accounts, it being a great month, both for profit and layings out.

1664-09-29 20:08   Fresh newes come of our beating the Dutch at Guinny quite out of all their castles almost, which will make them quite mad here at home.

1664-09-29 14:37   I with Sir G. Carteret to his new house he is taking in Broad Streete, and there surveyed all the rooms, in order to the drawing up a lease.

1664-09-28 22:07   At home I found Mercer playing on her Vyall, which is a pretty instrument, and so I to the Vyall and singing till late, and so to bed.

1664-09-28 17:14   With a safe conscience I do think my oathe is not broke and judge God Almighty will not think it other wise.

1664-09-28 17:08   Lord! to see how no more in words, sense, or design, it is to his “Harry the 5th” is not imaginable, and so poorly acted, is strange.

1664-09-28 17:06   My Lord Rutherford, would needs carry me and another Scotch Lord to a play, and so we saw part of “The Generall,” my Lord Orrery’s play.

1664-09-27 16:14   Home, where my wife having (after all her merry discourse of being with child) her months upon her is gone to bed.

1664-09-27 08:30   Lay long, sleeping, it raining and blowing very hard. Then up and to the office, my mouth still being scabby and a patch on it.

1664-09-26 20:40   I have looked too much after Tangier, but I have good reason to love myself for serving it, one of the best flowers in my garden.

1664-09-26 07:32   Up pretty well again, but my mouth very scabby, my cold being going away, so that I was forced to wear a great black patch.

1664-09-25 12:05   Comes Harman and his wife, whom I sent for to meet the Joyces, who came not. It seems Will has got a fall off his horse and broke his face.

1664-09-25 09:10   Up, and my throat being yet very sore, and, my head out of order, we went not to church.

1664-09-24 21:15   We were told to-day of a Dutch ship of 3 or 400 tons, where all the men were dead of the plague, and the ship cast ashore at Gottenburgh.

1664-09-24 14:48   Phillips told me that Monsieur Du Puy, that is so great a man at the Duke of Yorke’s, is a knave and by quality but a tailor.

1664-09-23 15:32   It was to no end to oppose, but all bore it, and after laughed at him for it.

1664-09-23 15:30   Sir J. Minnes took occasion, in the most childish manner, to reproach us all, but most himself, that he was not valued as Comptroller.

1664-09-23 07:44   My cold and pain in my head increasing, and the palate of my mouth falling, I was in great pain all night.

1664-09-22 22:03   To bed; having got a strange cold in my head, by flinging off my hat at dinner, and sitting with the wind in my neck.

1664-09-22 18:10   I found my wife not well, and she tells me she thinks she is with child, but I neither believe nor desire it. But God’s will be done!

1664-09-21 21:50   By discourse this day I have great hopes from Mr. Coventry that the Dutch and we shall not fall out.

1664-09-21 13:48   I was afresh delighted with Mr. Povy’s house and pictures of perspective, being strange things to think how they do delude one’s eye.

1664-09-21 10:10   To Houseman’s the picture drawer, and have his promise to take pains in what picture I shall set him about, and I think to have my wife’s.

1664-09-20 22:06   At my office doing much business, and I find with great delight that I am come to my good temper of business again. God continue me in it.

1664-09-20 15:15   Abroad to the Fishing Committee at Fishmongers’ Hall, and there sat and did some business considerable.

1664-09-19 17:58   It is no matter, I shall be the freer from the inconvenience that might follow, besides offending God Almighty and neglecting my business.

1664-09-19 17:57   I to Westminster to Jervas’s, and spoke with Jane; who I find cold and not so desirous of a meeting as before.

1664-09-19 14:07   After dinner I did give my wife 15l. to lay out in linen and necessaries for the house and to buy a suit for Pall.

1664-09-19 06:47   Up, my wife and I having a little anger about her woman already, she thinking that I take too much care of her at table.

1664-09-18 21:21   My aunt Wight did send my wife a scarfe as a token for her givings to her. My aime is to get more from my uncle’s favour than this.

1664-09-18 17:02   I walked to Westminster, and there spent all the afternoon in the Cloysters as I had agreed with Jane Welsh, but she came not.

1664-09-18 12:50   Comes Anthony and W. Joyce (their wives being in the country with my father) and dined with me very merry as I can be in such company.

1664-09-17 09:20   I am fearful every day of having some change of the office. The truth is I am a little guilty of being remiss myself of what I used to be.

1664-09-16 16:10   All the winter within doors, some few playing at chesse, but most drinking their time away. Women live very slavishly in Moscow.

1664-09-16 16:09   Moscow is a very great city, yet few people compared with this, and poor, sorry houses, the Emperor himself living in a wooden house.

1664-09-16 16:04   Mr. Pargiter and I walked into the fields as far almost as Sir G. Whitmore’s, all the way talking of Russia, which, he says, is a sad place.

1664-09-16 14:32   I forth with my boy to buy severall things, stools and andirons and candlesticks, &c, and bought a large pair of compasses.

1664-09-16 12:12   To the Sun taverne, where Sir W. Warren brought to me, being all alone; 100l. in a bag, which I offered him to give him my receipt for.

1664-09-15 17:10   Many people came in and kept me all the afternoon, among other the Master and Wardens of Chyrurgeon’s Hall, who staid arguing their cause.

1664-09-14 15:28   To the office, and down to Blackwall by water to view a place found out for laying of masts, and I think it will be most proper.

1664-09-14 07:50   The jade, whether out of fear or ill-nature or simplicity I know not, but Besse took it and asked leave to go forth to look a place and did.

1664-09-14 07:40   Wanting some things for my dressing myself I was angry, and one thing after another made my wife give Besse warning to be gone.

1664-09-13 15:20   We met upon the Fishery Committee, and good things discoursed of making of farthings, which was proposed as a way of raising money.

1664-09-12 17:33   With Mr. Creed walked up and down in the New Exchange, talking mightily of the convenience and necessity of a man’s wearing good clothes.

1664-09-12 14:50   Took boat and by water to the Neat Houses over against Fox Hall to have seen Greatorex dive.

1664-09-12 13:20   To Jane, and there upstairs and drank with her, and staid two hours with her kissing her, but nothing more.

1664-09-12 09:40   To St. James’s, and saw the Duke with great pleasure play with his little girle, like an ordinary private father of a child.

1664-09-11 20:08   This afternoon Sir J. Minnes fell sicke at church, and going down the stairs fell down dead, but came to himself again and is pretty well.

1664-09-11 18:52   Jane told me how she could not come to me this afternoon, but promised another time.

1664-09-11 18:46   I went by Jervas’s, and there stood Jane at the door, and so I took her in and drank with her, her master and mistress being out of doors.

1664-09-11 18:04   To the Abbey, according to promise to meet Jane Welsh, and there wearily walked, expecting her till 6 o’clock from three, but no Jane came.

1664-09-11 09:10   To church in the best manner I have gone a good while, that is to say, with my wife, and her woman, Mercer, and Tom, my boy, waiting on us.

1664-09-10 17:32   My wife and I and Mercer to the Duke’s house, and there saw “The Rivalls,” which is no excellent play, but good acting in it.

1664-09-10 11:59   To the office, and I troubled to think what the end of our sluggishness will be, for we do nothing like people able to carry on a warr.

1664-09-09 23:08   My boy, a brave boy, sings finely, and is the most pleasant boy at present, while his ignorant boy’s tricks last, that ever I saw.

1664-09-09 23:06   The girle plays well upon the harpsicon, but only ordinary tunes, but hath a good hand; sings a little, but hath a good voyce and eare.

1664-09-09 23:02   My wife and Mercer and Tom and I sat till eleven, singing and fiddling, and a joy it is to see me master of so much pleasure in my house.

1664-09-09 14:10   They eyed mightily my great cupboard of plate, I this day putting my two flaggons upon my table; and indeed it is a fine sight.

1664-09-09 14:05   I was as merry as I could, giving them a good dinner; but W. Joyce did so talk, that he made every body else dumb, but only laugh at him.

1664-09-09 12:12   Sarah Gyles’ husband did not come, and I understand that it was because he was not yet able to pay me the 40s. she had borrowed a year ago.

1664-09-09 12:03   At noon comes my company, namely, Anthony and Will Joyce and their wives, my aunt James newly come out of Wales, and my cozen Sarah Gyles.

1664-09-09 08:20   Up, and to put things in order against dinner. I out and bought several things, among others, a dozen of silver salts.

1664-09-08 21:40   I went home and there find Mercer, whose person I like well, and I think will do well, at least I hope so.

1664-09-08 20:10   Here merry, and good discourse, fain to admire the knowledge and experience of Mrs. Bland, who I think as good a merchant as her husband.

1664-09-08 19:40   Mr. Povey came to me and took me out to supper to Mr. Bland’s, who is making now all haste to be gone for Tangier.

1664-09-08 15:33   My wife being well dressed by her new woman, Mary Mercer, a decayed merchant’s daughter, did go to the christening of Mrs. Mills’ child.

1664-09-07 19:30   By coach home, where I find my wife hath had her head dressed by her woman, Mercer, which is to come to her to-morrow.

1664-09-07 17:58   With Creed walked to Bartholomew Fayre, this being the last day, and saw the best dancing on the ropes that I think I ever saw in my life.

1664-09-07 15:30   To my office, taking in Bagwell’s wife, but company came to me so soon that I could have no discourse with her, as I intended, of pleasure.

1664-09-07 11:32   To the ‘Change, where great talke of the forwardnesse of the Dutch, which puts us all to a stand.

1664-09-07 10:40   With Mr. Margetts to Limehouse to see his ground and ropeyarde there, which is very fine, and I believe we shall employ it for the Navy.

1664-09-07 08:45   Lay long to-day, pleasantly discoursing with my wife about the dinner we are to have for the Joyces, a day or two hence.

1664-09-06 19:22   My coach stopping over against a poulterer’s shop, I took occasion to buy a rabbit, but it proved a deadly old one when I came to eat it.

1664-09-06 17:21   Doll is so pretty, that I could not think it too much — which is a strange slavery that I stand in to beauty, that I value nothing near it.

1664-09-06 17:19   I called upon Doll for a pair of gloves trimmed with yellow ribbon, to match the petticoate my wife bought yesterday, which cost me 20s.

1664-09-06 13:55   To my office and waited, thinking to have had Bagwell’s wife come to me about business, that I might have talked with her, but she came not.

1664-09-05 16:08   To Woolwich, then to Deptford, and home, all the way reading Sir J. Suckling’s “Aglaura,” which is but a mean play; nothing of design in it.

1664-09-05 13:55   Mrs. Lane is undone by her marrying so bad, and desires to speak with me, which I know is to get me to get her husband a place.

1664-09-05 13:30   W. Bowyer dined with us; but strange to see how he could not endure onyons in sauce to lamb, but was overcome with the sight of it.

1664-09-05 11:29   I to my wife to Unthanke’s, and with her from shop to shop, laying out near 10l. this morning in clothes for her.

1664-09-05 09:22   Up and to St. James’s, and there did our business with the Duke; where all our discourse of warr in the highest measure.

1664-09-04 16:58   It is a joy that I am come to this condition to maintain a person able to give me such pleasure as this boy doth by his understand of music.

1664-09-04 16:32   Mr Hill came to tell me that he had got a gentlewoman for my wife, one Mrs Ferrabosco. I seemed glad; but I hear she is too gallant for me.

1664-09-04 16:10   The boy and I to singing of psalms, and then came Mr. Hill and sung with us; he gone, the boy and I to the singing of Mr. Porter’s mottets.

1664-09-04 10:48   Looking over my old wardrobe and laying by things for my brother John and my father, by which I shall leave myself very bare in clothes.

1664-09-03 22:10   I late to send by the post &c; and so to supper and to bed — my itching and tickling continuing still, the weather continuing cold.

1664-09-03 17:08   I would I could get a good husband for Jane, for she is one I always thought a good-natured as well as a well-looked girl.

1664-09-03 17:05   At my barber’s had good luck to find Jane alone; I got the poor wretch to promise to meet me in the abbey on tomorrow come sennit.

1664-09-03 15:44   To the Fishing Committee, but not above four of us met which could do nothing, and a sad thing it is to see so great a work so ill followed.

1664-09-03 06:25   I found that it is only the change of the weather from hot to cold, which do stop my pores, and so my blood tingles all over my body.

1664-09-03 06:20   I have had a bad night’s rest. I thought myself to be mightily bit with fleas, and my wife chid her mayds for not looking the fleas a-days.

1664-09-02 21:06   Here till late and dark, then up and down, to buy combes for my wife to give her mayds, and then by coach home.

1664-09-02 17:30   Pretty it is to see how our boy carries himself so innocently clownish as would make one laugh.

1664-09-02 15:05   I got my wife to rise and abroad with me by coach to Bartholomew Fayre, and our boy with us, and there shewed them the dancing on the ropes.

1664-09-02 06:04   After long waiting below, Mr. Cole being under the barber’s hands, he did give me hopes of getting my debt that my brother owed me.

1664-09-01 13:48   We cut up the great cake Moorcocke lately sent us, which is very good.

1664-09-01 13:29   To the ’Change and thence brought Mr. Pierce, the Surgeon, and Creed, and dined very merry; my wife not being well of those she not with us.

1664-09-01 11:55   A sad rainy night, up and to the office, where busy all the morning.
