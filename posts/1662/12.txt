1662-12-31 23:59   For the condition of myself, wife, family, and estate, and for the public state of the nation, so quiett as it is, the Lord God be praised!

1662-12-31 23:56   The Duke of Monmouth is in so great splendour some doubt, if the King should have no child, whether he would not be acknowledged for a son.

1662-12-31 23:53   By my last year’s diligence in my office, I am come to a good degree of knowledge therein; and am acknowledged so by all the world.

1662-12-31 23:50   My family is myself and wife; William, my clerk; Jane, my wife’s upper mayde; Susan, our cook-mayde; and Wayneman, my boy.

1662-12-31 21:20   Having staid as long as I thought fit, to my infinite content, it being the greatest pleasure I could wish now to see at Court, I went out.

1662-12-31 20:50   To country dances; the King leading the first, which he called for; which was, says he, “Cuckolds all awry,” the old dance of England.

1662-12-31 20:25   The King led a lady a single Coranto and then the rest of the lords, one after another, other ladies. Very noble it was and pleasure to see.

1662-12-31 20:08   The King takes out the Duchess; and the Duke, the Duchess of Buckingham; the Duke of Monmouth, my Lady Castlemaine; they danced the Bransle.

1662-12-31 19:42   By and by comes the King and Queen, the Duke and Duchess, and all the great ones.

1662-12-31 19:07   Mr. Povy and I to White Hall; he carrying me thither on purpose to carry me into the ball this night before the King.

1662-12-31 16:21   Pleased to hear Mrs. Bland talk like a merchant in her husband’s business very well. It seems she do understand it and perform a great deal.

1662-12-31 13:36   Or of Mrs. Clerke’s genius, which I so much admired, I finding her to be so conceited in her dress, though the truth is, witty enough.

1662-12-31 13:35   I confess I am wedded from the opinion either of Mrs Pierce’s beauty upon discovery of her naked neck to-day, being undrest when we came in.

1662-12-31 12:30   To Mrs. Pierce’s by invitacion to dinner where there came Dr. Clerke and his wife and Mr. Knight, chief chyrurgeon to the King and his wife.

1662-12-30 18:09   To White Hall, where I carried my wife to see the Queen in her presence-chamber; and the maydes of honour and the young Duke of Monmouth.

1662-12-30 16:33   A little, proud, ugly, talking lady, that was much crying up the Queen-Mother’s Court at Somerset House above our own Queen’s.

1662-12-30 13:12   When the people at the Cape of Good Hope come to age, the men do cut off one of the stones of each other, to get children the better.

1662-12-30 08:04   Up and to the office, whither Sir W. Pen came, the first time that he has come downstairs since his late great sickness of the gout.

1662-12-29 21:02   In pain that my wife hath never a winter gown, being ashamed of it, that she should be seen in a taffeta one when all the world wears moyre.

1662-12-29 19:57   I have almost found out a young gentlewoman for my turn, to wait on my wife, of good family and that can sing.

1662-12-29 12:07   I got through the croude as high as the King. I saw all the presents being rich furs, hawks, carpets, cloths of tissue, and sea-horse teeth.

1662-12-29 11:14   To White Hall, and got up to the top gallerys in the Banquetting House, to see the audience of the Russia Embassadors.

1662-12-29 08:57   Nor any of the neighbours hearing of it till the house was down. How this should come to pass, God knows, but a most strange thing it is!

1662-12-29 08:55   Mrs. Mitchell told me of the strange burning of Mr. De Laun, a merchant’s house in Loathbury, and his lady and her whole family.

1662-12-28 20:28   I fell to the renewing my last year’s oaths, whereby it has pleased God so much to better myself and practise.

1662-12-28 09:30   With my wife to church, and coming out, went out both before my Lady Batten, he not being there, which I believe will vex her.

1662-12-27 17:32   I not so pleased with the company at the house to-day, which was full of citizens, there hardly being a gentleman or woman in the house.

1662-12-27 17:21   We saw the second part of “Rhodes,” done with the new Roxalana; which do it rather better in all respects, then the first Roxalana.

1662-12-27 06:49   I sent for my boy’s brother, William, that lives in town here as a groom, to whom I told my resolution to keep the boy no longer.

1662-12-26 22:01   Being vexed at my boy for his staying playing abroad when he is sent of errands. I am resolved to keep him no more.

1662-12-26 18:04   Home, and found my wife busy among her pies, but angry for some saucy words that her mayde Jane has given her, which I will not allow of.

1662-12-26 17:15   Lord! to consider how my natural desire is to pleasure, which God be praised that he has given me the power to curb so well as I have done.

1662-12-26 17:10   To the Duke’s house and saw “The Villaine” which I ought not to do without my wife, but that my time is now out that I did undertake it for.

1662-12-26 11:20   When I came to read Hudebras, it is so silly an abuse of the Presbyter Knight going to the warrs, that I am ashamed of it.

1662-12-26 09:35   Hither come Mr. Battersby; and we falling into a discourse of a new book of drollery in verse called Hudebras, I would needs go find it out.

1662-12-26 08:02   Up, my wife to the making of Christmas pies all day, being now pretty well again, and I abroad to several places about some businesses.

1662-12-25 23:57   To my office, practising arithmetique alone and making an end of last night’s book with great content, and so home to supper and to bed.

1662-12-25 14:42   I sent for a mince-pie abroad, my wife not being well to make any herself yet.

1662-12-25 14:07   I dined by my wife’s bed-side with great content, having a mess of brave plum-porridge and a roasted pullet for dinner.

1662-12-25 11:36   The sermon done, a good anthem followed, with vialls, and then the King came down to receive the Sacrament.

1662-12-25 11:04   But one that stood by whispered in my ear that the Bishopp himself do not spend one groat to the poor himself.

1662-12-25 11:03   Bishopp Morley did much press us to joy in these publique days of joy, and to hospitality.

1662-12-25 09:55   I spent my time looking over pictures, particularly the ships in King Henry the VIIIth’s voyage to Bullen.

1662-12-25 09:03   I had a pleasant walk to White Hall, where I intended to have received the Communion with the family, but I came a little too late.

1662-12-24 21:20   This evening Mr. Gauden sent me, against Christmas, a great chine of beef and three dozen of tongues.

1662-12-24 21:07   So home to supper and to bed, my wife not being well, she having her months upon her.

1662-12-24 20:14   I read Mr. Bland’s discourse concerning Trade, which (he being no scholler and so knows not the rules of writing orderly) is very good.

1662-12-24 17:21   I met Mr. Creed, who takes it ill my letter last night to Mr. Povy, wherein I accuse him of the neglect of the Tangier boats.

1662-12-24 14:38   To my brother’s and shoemaker, and so to my Lord Crew’s, and dined alone with him, and after dinner much discourse about matters.

1662-12-23 17:55   Dr. Pierce tells me what the world says of me, that Mr. Coventry and I do all the business of the office almost: at which I am highly proud.

1662-12-23 17:41   Mr. Edward Montagu is quite broke at Court with his repute and purse; and he lately was engaged in a quarrell against my Lord Chesterfield.

1662-12-23 15:47   Up to make up my accounts with my wife, and find that my ordinary housekeeping comes to 7l. a month, which is a great deal.

1662-12-22 22:07   My wife and I to read “Ovid’s Metamorphoses,” which I brought her home from Paul’s Churchyard to-night.

1662-12-22 17:38   To Woolwich, where we eat and drank at Mr. Pett’s, and put in practice my new way of the Call-book, which will be of great use.

1662-12-22 14:30   Mr. Coventry’s people having a horse ready for me (so fine a one that I was afeard to get upon him) and I got up and followed the Duke.

1662-12-22 14:10   To Mr. Coventry’s chamber, where I found him gone into the Park with the Duke, so I shifted myself into a riding-habitt, and followed him.

1662-12-22 08:02   Read a good part of “The Advice to a Daughter,” but in all my life I never did nor can expect to see so much nonsense in print.

1662-12-21 19:22   In comes my simple Lord Chandois, who began to sing psalms, but so dully that I was weary of it.

1662-12-21 15:08   My brother told me some hopes he had of bringing his business to pass still of his mistress, but I advised him to give it quite over.

1662-12-20 16:07   It contents me to see my Lord trust me as his confidant: so I bid him good night, he being to go into the country, to keep his Christmas.

1662-12-20 14:49   We met upon the Tangier Commission; but little will be done before my Lord Rutherford comes there, as to the fortification or Mole.

1662-12-19 21:48   Displeased with my wife who is troubled with her lonely life, which I know not how without charge to help, but I will study how to do it.

1662-12-19 15:07   We went to them at work, and having wrought below the bottom of the foundation of the wall I bid them give over, and so all our hopes ended.

1662-12-19 14:42   It being cold, Mr. Lee and I did sit all the day by the fire in the Governor’s house.

1662-12-19 08:30   With Mr. Lee, Wade, Evett, and workmen to the Tower, and set them to work in the garden, against the mayne-guard, a most unlikely place.

1662-12-18 17:58   I to Mr. Cade the stationer, to direct him what to do with my two copies of Mr. Holland’s books which he is to bind.

1662-12-18 15:48   Balty’s wife is a little and yet, pretty old girl, not handsome, nor has anything pleasing, but, they say, she plays well on the Base Violl.

1662-12-18 13:31   Mr. Coventry inviting himself to dinner, but my dinner being a legg of mutton and two capons, they were not done enough, which did vex me.

1662-12-17 10:39   Intending to have gone upon our new design to the Tower today; but it raining, and the work being to be done in the garden, we put it off.

1662-12-16 18:22   I am sorry that I have parted with Sarah, though it was against my will. If she had anything I would commend her for a wife for my brother.

1662-12-16 18:08   Sarah, my late mayde, told me out of good will to me, that I would beware of my wife’s brother, for he is begging or borrowing of her.

1662-12-16 17:18   Having sat talking with Mr. Moore bewailing the vanity and disorders of the age, I went by coach to my brother’s.

1662-12-16 15:49   To White Hall to Secretary Bennet’s, and agreed with Mr. Lee to set upon our new adventure at the Tower to-morrow.

1662-12-16 11:07   What a most troublesome fellow that Strutt is, such as I never did meet with his fellow in my life.

1662-12-15 15:52   Going down, I saw that he had done little or no hurt; and so I give them a shilling for it and they were well contented.

1662-12-15 15:50   The butchers stopped the horses, and a great rout of people in the street, crying that he had done him 40s. and 5l. worth of hurt.

1662-12-15 15:48   Driving through the backside of the Shambles in Newgate Market, my coach plucked down two pieces of beef into the dirt.

1662-12-15 11:05   The King is very kind to the Queen; who is one of the best women in the world. Strange how the King is bewitched to this pretty Castlemaine.

1662-12-15 10:58   Dr. Clerke, in discourse tells me, that Sir Charles Barkeley’s greatness is only his being pimp to the King, and to my Lady Castlemaine.

1662-12-15 09:10   I find myself more and more obliged to Mr. Coventry, who studies to do me all the right he can in every thing to the Duke.

1662-12-15 07:58   To the Duke, and followed him into the Park, where, though the ice was broken, yet he would go slide upon his scates, which I did not like.

1662-12-14 17:34   To my Lord’s, and there Mr. Howe and Pagett, an old lover of musique. We sang some Psalms of Mr. Lawes, and played some symphonys between.

1662-12-13 12:59   To the office again, and there made an end of last night’s examination, and got my study there made very clean and put in order.

1662-12-12 22:58   To the office, and there examining my copy of Mr. Holland’s book, and so home to supper and bed.

1662-12-12 06:32   From a very hard frost, when I wake, I find a very great thaw, and my house overflown with it, which vexed me.

1662-12-11 16:21   Mr. Creed dined with me, and we sat all the afternoon together, discoursing of ways to get money, which I am now giving myself wholly up to.

1662-12-10 15:04   I found our new cook-mayde Susan come, who is recommended to us by my wife’s brother, for which I like her never the better.

1662-12-10 09:22   Back to the office with Sir J. Minnes, in his coach, but so great a snow that we could hardly pass the streets.

1662-12-10 07:43   Receiving a messenger from Sir G. Carteret and a letter from Mr. Coventry, one contrary to another, about our letter to my Lord Treasurer.

1662-12-09 17:39   To Sir G. Carteret at the Treasury office about my Lord Treasurer’s letter, wherein he puts me to a new trouble to write it over again.

1662-12-09 15:49   Vexed in my mind about the going away of Sarah this afternoon, who cried mightily, and so was I ready to do, and Jane did also.

1662-12-09 00:14   I made Gosnell and we sit up looking over the book of Dances, not observing how the time went, and so to prayers and to bed.

1662-12-08 09:07   Balty did tell Gosnell that my wife did go every day to Court and plays, and that she should have liberty of going abroad as often.

1662-12-07 21:18   I do smell that my wife’s brother I doubt is overreached in thinking that he has got a rich wife, and I fear she will prove otherwise.

1662-12-07 17:49   I differing from my aunt in our opinion of the handsomeness of the Queen, which I oppose, saying that if my nose be handsome, then is hers.

1662-12-07 15:07   To the French church; but finding the Dutch congregation, and finding the French congregation’s sermon begun in the Dutch, I returned home.

1662-12-06 14:59   After dinner sat with my wife and Gosnell a good while, till my wife seemed to take notice of my being at home now more than at other times.

1662-12-05 22:07   I entertain myself with my wife and Gosnell, who sings exceeding well, and I shall take great delight in her, and so merrily to bed.

1662-12-05 20:00   Home, and there I find Gosnell come, who, my wife tells me, is like to prove a pretty companion, of which I am glad.

1662-12-05 08:03   I think never servant and mistress parted upon such foolish terms in the world, only for an opinion in my wife that Sarah is ill-natured.

1662-12-04 17:42   At the office all the morning setting about business, and after dinner to it again, and so till night.

1662-12-03 17:14   Seeing one of the Russia Embassador’s coaches go along, with his footmen not in liverys, but their country habits, which was very strange.

1662-12-03 14:33   We did call at Limehouse to view two Busses that are building, that being a thing we are now very hot upon.

1662-12-03 12:08   Measuring New England masts, with which I was much pleased for my information, though I perceive great neglect in all the King’s officers.

1662-12-02 23:10   I to my office till late preparing business, and so home, being cold, and this night first put on a wastecoate. So to bed.

1662-12-02 14:22   I did give Jane a serious lesson, against we take her to be our chamber-maid, which I spoke so to her that the poor girl cried.

1662-12-02 07:07   Before I went to the office my wife and I had another falling out about Sarah, against whom she has a deadly hate, I know not for what.

1662-12-01 17:12   Nor did the King or Queen smile all the whole play, nor any of the company take any pleasure but what was in the greatness of the company.

1662-12-01 17:10   I to the Cockpitt, where I saw “The Valiant Cidd” acted, a play I have read with great delight, but is a most dull thing acted.

1662-12-01 12:58   We all met to a venison pasty, and were very merry, Major Norwood being with us, whom they did play upon for his surrendering of Dunkirk.

1662-12-01 11:07   Over the Parke (where I first in my life, it being a great frost, did see people sliding with their skeates, which is a very pretty art).

1662-12-01 09:14   Mr. Coventry did do me the great kindness to take notice to the Duke of my pains in making a collection of all contracts about masts.
