1662-07-31 21:04   I am in town only with my man Will and Jane, and because my house is in building, I do lie at Sir W. Pen’s house, he being gone to Ireland.

1662-07-31 20:56   It being the last day of the month, I did make up my accounts, and found myself worth about 650l, for which the Lord God be praised.

1662-07-31 15:08   We found Sir W Batten going about his survey, but so poorly and unlike a survey of the Navy, that I am ashamed of it, and so is Mr Coventry.

1662-07-31 11:47   To my office, and there we sat all the morning, where I begin more and more to grow considerable there.


1662-07-30 20:31   To the Rope-yard, repeating trialls of the strength, wayte, and waste of hemp by which I have furnished myself enough to finish my business.

1662-07-30 10:49   My Lord’s people tell me how bravely he did carry himself, while my Lord Crofts did cry; all the town talk how poorly he carried himself.

1662-07-30 10:16   By water to White Hall and there waited upon my Lord Sandwich; and joyed him, at his lodgings, of his safe coming home after all his danger.

1662-07-30 06:08   Cooper came to me and begun his lecture upon the body of a ship, which my having of a modell in the office is of great use to me.


1662-07-29 20:20   To see the difference between the flags sent in now-a-days, and I find the old ones, which were much cheaper, to be wholly as good.

1662-07-29 19:02   Walked to Deptford (Cooper with me talking of mathematiques), to send a fellow to prison for cutting of buoy ropes.

1662-07-29 14:22   To Sir W. Batten’s to dinner, and there merry, and very friendly to Sir Wm. and he to me, but I know he envies me, and I do not value him.

1662-07-29 12:15   I broached the business of our being abused about flags, which I know doth trouble Sir W. Batten, but I care not.

1662-07-29 12:07   To the office, and there we sat all the morning, Sir George Carteret and Mr. Coventry being come from sea.


1662-07-28 21:47   To my chamber a little troubled and melancholy, to my lute, and so to bed, Will lying at my feet, and the wench in my house in Will’s bed.

1662-07-28 07:48   I to the Tower; hearing that the Queen-Mother is come this morning already as high as Woolwich: and that my Lord Sandwich was with her.

1662-07-28 06:31   I walked with my wife to the George, at Holborn Conduit, where the coach stood ready to carry her and her maid to Bugden.


1662-07-27 15:32   Meeting with Laud Crispe we sat under a tree in a corner and sung some songs, he singing well, but no skill, and so would sing false.

1662-07-27 15:03   I carried my wife to Westminster, and I to walk in the Park, which is now every day more and more pleasant, by the new works upon it.


1662-07-26 16:53   I went to Westminster; and there hear that the King and Queen intend to come to White Hall from Hampton Court next week, for all winter.

1662-07-26 15:30   A letter from Mr. Creed, who got safe to the Downs; and that there the King do tell him that he is sure my Lord is landed at Callis safe.

1662-07-26 14:21   Causing the model hanging in my chamber to be taken down and hung up in my office, for fear of being spoilt by the workmen.


1662-07-25 11:44   Reading Mr Holland’s discourse of the Navy, and am pleased with them, they hitting the diseases of the Navy we are troubled with now-a-days.


1662-07-24 21:07   To my office, where all the afternoon busy, among other things improving my late experiment at Woolwich about hemp.

1662-07-24 11:10   I hear, to my great content, that my Lord Sandwich is safe landed in France.


1662-07-23 22:10   Much disturbed by reason of the talk up and down the town, that my Lord Sandwich is lost; but I trust in God the contrary.

1662-07-23 21:36   Quite out of sorts in my mind by reason that the weather is so bad, and my house all full of wet.

1662-07-23 11:41   Vexed that my brother Tom do fail to get a coach for my wife and maid this week, by which she will not be at Brampton Feast to meet my Lady.

1662-07-23 08:49   This morning angry a little, and my house being so much out of order makes me a little pettish.


1662-07-22 13:58   At dinner I was highly angry with my wife for her keys being out of the way, but they were found at last, and so friends again.

1662-07-22 07:48   All safe, only my Lord Sandwich; they know not what is become of him, which do trouble me; but I hope he got ashore before the storm begun.

1662-07-22 07:37   Letters from Mr. Coventry; who tells me of the foul weather that drove them back from near Boulogne, whither they were going for the Queen.


1662-07-21 20:42   We found that my Lady was angry for our neglecting to see her as we used to do, but after a little she was pleased as she was used to be.

1662-07-21 15:22   Capt. Cocke’s lady was angry to him for disappointing a gentleman he had invited to dinner, which he took like a wise man and said little.

1662-07-21 09:38   To the Rope-yard; and did fall upon my survey of seeing the experiments of the strength and the charge in the dressing of every sort.

1662-07-21 07:29   Capt. Cocke showed silver dishes, which he bought of an embassador that did lack money, in the rim of which was placed gold medalls.

1662-07-21 05:07   Though I found myself out of order and cold, yet upon my desire to do what I intended, I down to Greenwich, to Captain Cocke’s.


1662-07-20 20:55   By carrying the key to Sir W. Pen’s last night, it could not in the midst of all my hurry, be found, and at last they found it in the fire.

1662-07-20 20:29   To Sir W. Pen’s to my chamber again, being all in dirt and foul, and in fear of having catched cold today with dabbling in the water.

1662-07-20 15:11   The house will be freer, for it is impossible to have anybody come into my house while it is in this condition.

1662-07-20 15:09   I and my wife concluded to have her go and her two maids and the boy, and so there shall be none but Will and I left at home.

1662-07-20 10:15   I fitted myself for dirt, and removed all my books to the office and restoring things, it raining as hard within doors as without.

1662-07-20 07:32   I went into my house and find that it is as wet as the open street, and that there is not one dry-footing above nor below in my house.

1662-07-20 07:04   My wife and I lay talking long in bed, and at last she is come to be willing to stay two months in the country.


1662-07-19 16:33   Methought it lessened my esteem of a king, that he should not be able to command the rain.

1662-07-19 16:29   It raining hard upon the water, I put ashore and sheltered, while the King came by in his barge, going towards the Downs to meet the Queen.

1662-07-19 06:41   With my wife discoursing about her going into the country, and as she is not very forward so am I at a loss whether to have her go or no.


1662-07-18 22:07   To bed, being much troubled at the rain coming into my house, the top being open.

1662-07-18 21:17   Comes Cooper for my mathematiques but, in good earnest, my head is so full of business that I cannot understand it as otherwise I should do.

1662-07-18 12:28   By water to Deptford, to put several things in order, being myself now only left in town, and so back again to the office.

1662-07-18 05:01   I got a-top of my house, seeing the design of my work, and like it very well, and it comes into my head to have my dining-room wainscoated.


1662-07-17 22:26   Very late I was forced to send for Mr. Turner, Smith, Young, about things to be sent down early to-morrow on board the King’s pleasure boat.

1662-07-17 22:21   I found much business to be upon my hands and was late at the office writing letters by candle light which is rare at this time of the year.

1662-07-17 15:32   I presented my Lord with a state of his accounts to the 14th of July, which did please him, and to my joy I continue in his great esteem.


1662-07-16 17:08   We went to Mr. Creed’s lodging, and I seeing a neat leaden standish to carry papers, pen, and ink in when one travels I got that of him.

1662-07-16 14:50   I seeming to like a ring made of a coco-nutt with a stone done in it, Captain Ferrers did offer and would give it me.

1662-07-16 14:48   I dined with Mr. Moore and the people below, who fell to talk of Portugall rings, and Captain Ferrers offered five or six to sell.

1662-07-16 10:22   I consulted about drawing up a fair state of all my Lord’s accounts. I fell to writing of it neatly, and it was handsome and concisely done.

1662-07-16 05:52   I found all my ceilings, spoiled with rain last night, so that I fear they must be all new whited when the work is done.


1662-07-15 21:07   It fell a-raining, and the house being all open at top, it vexed me; but there was no help for it.

1662-07-15 18:10   Comes Mr. Cooper, and I took him by water on purpose to tell me things belonging to ships, which was time well spent.


1662-07-14 20:08   My house being this day almost quite untiled in order to its rising higher.

1662-07-14 10:48   I found the pageant in Cornhill taken down, which was pretty strange.

1662-07-14 09:33   To Thames Street along with old Mr. Green, among the tarr-men, and did instruct myself in the nature and prices of tarr.


1662-07-13 18:18   I did discourse with Mr. Turner about the faults of our management of the business of our office, but I believe is a very knave.

1662-07-13 14:59   I set about making my chamber fit against to-morrow to have the people come to work in pulling down the top of my house.

1662-07-13 11:49   Having by some mischance hurt my cods, I had my old pain all yesterday and this morning, and so kept my bed all this morning.


1662-07-12 07:28   I put things in my house in order to be laid up, against my workmen come to take down the top of my house, which troubles me to think of it.


1662-07-11 13:38   To the Ropeyard, and viewed the hemp, wherein we found great corruption, and then saw a trial between Sir R. Ford’s yarn and our own.

1662-07-11 10:59   To Mr. Ackworth’s and Sheldon’s to view their books, which we found not to answer the King’s service and security at all as to the stores.

1662-07-11 09:24   To Woolwich, and viewed well all the houses and stores there, which lie in very great confusion for want of storehouses.

1662-07-11 07:53   We down to Deptford, and viewed some deals served in at a low price, which our officers, like knaves, would untruly value in their worth.

1662-07-11 05:13   Up by four o’clock, and hard at my multiplicacion-table, which I am now almost master of, and so made me ready and to my office.


1662-07-10 11:09   To the office, but it vexes me to see so much disorder at our table, that, every man minding a several business, we dispatch nothing.

1662-07-10 05:57   I did call my wife and Sarah, and did make up a difference between them, for she is so good a servant as I am loth to part with her.


1662-07-09 15:49   I would have my wife go to Brampton but for the cost. To stay here will be inconvenient because of the dirt when my house is pulled down.

1662-07-09 11:38   I did, God forgive me! promise Sir W. Pen all my service and love, though the rogue knows he deserves none, nor do I intend to show him any.

1662-07-09 04:27   Up by four o’clock, and at my multiplicacion-table hard, which is all the trouble I meet withal in my arithmetique.


1662-07-08 17:02 r My Lord do seem still to have his old confidence in me; and tells me to boot, that Mr. Coventry hath spoke of me to him to great advantage; wherein I am much pleased.

1662-07-08 15:28   In all haste to make up my accounts with my Lord, which I did with some trouble, because I had some hopes to have made a profit to myself in this account and above what was due to me (which God forgive me in), but I could not.


1662-07-07 12:10   My morning’s work at the office was to put the new books of my office into order, and writing on the backsides what books they be, and transcribing out of some old books some things into them.


1662-07-06 17:48   To supper with my Lady, who tells me, with much trouble, that my Lady Castlemaine is still as great with the King, and that the King comes as often to her as ever he did, at which, God forgive me, I am well pleased.

1662-07-06 09:05   Lay long in bed today with my wife merry and pleasant, and then rose and settled my accounts with my wife for housekeeping, and do see that my kitchen, besides wine, fire, candle, sope, and many other things, comes to about 30s. a week, or a little over.


1662-07-05 21:20   So at my office all the afternoon, and then my mathematiques at night with Mr. Cooper, and so to supper and to bed.

1662-07-05 14:38 r Above all things it is considerable that my mind was never in my life in so good a condition of quiet as it has been since I have followed my business and seen myself to get greater and greater fitness in my employment, and honour every day more than other.

1662-07-05 14:32   Mr. Creed would, with all his rhetoric, have persuaded me to have gone to a play; and I find my nature desirous to have gone, notwithstanding my promise and my business, to which I have lately kept myself so close, but I did refuse it, and I hope shall ever do so.

1662-07-05 13:44 r I having some venison given me a day or two ago, and so I had a shoulder roasted, another baked, and the umbles baked in a pie, and all very well done. We were merry as I could be in that company.

1662-07-05 12:23   We had Sir W. Pen, who I hate with all my heart for his base treacherous tricks, but yet I think it not policy to declare it yet, and his son William, to my house to dinner, where was also Mr. Creed and my cozen Harry Alcocke.


1662-07-04 17:10   I sent my brother Tom, at his request, my father’s old Bass Viall which he and I have kept so long, but I fear Tom will do little good at it.

1662-07-04 14:22 r From that we fell to discourse of Sir W. Batten’s corruption and the people that he employs, and from one discourse to another of the kind. I was much pleased with his company.

1662-07-04 12:05   Sir W. Warren did come to me about business, and did begin to instruct me in the nature of fine timber and deals, telling me the nature of every sort.

1662-07-04 07:50 r After an hour’s being with him at arithmetique (my first attempt being to learn the multiplication-table); then we parted till tomorrow.

1662-07-04 06:42   Comes Mr. Cooper, mate of the Royall Charles, of whom I intend to learn mathematiques, and do begin with him today, he being a very able man, and no great matter, I suppose, will content him.


1662-07-03 21:00   After a turn or two upon the leads with my wife, who has lately had but little of my company, since I begun to follow my business, but is contented therewith since she sees how I spend my time, and so to bed.

1662-07-03 19:17 r Wherein he stated the government of the Chest to me; and upon the whole did tell me how it hath ever been abused, and to this day is; and what a meritorious act it would be to look after it; which I am resolved to do, if God bless me; and do thank him very much for it.

1662-07-03 19:14   Came Mr. Lewis to me, and very ingeniously did enquire whether I ever did look into the business of the Chest at Chatham; and after my readiness to be informed did appear to him, he did produce a paper.

1662-07-03 15:13   Was brought to Sir W. Compton a gun to discharge seven times, the best of all devices that ever I saw, and very serviceable, and not a bawble; for it is much approved of, and many thereof made.

1662-07-03 14:21 r We all by invitation dined at the Dolphin with the Officers of the Ordnance; where Sir W. Compton, Mr. O’Neale, and other great persons, were, and a very great dinner, but I drank as I still do but my allowance of wine.

1662-07-03 09:10 r Home to dress myself, and so to the office, where another fray between Sir R. Ford and myself about his yarn, wherein I find the board to yield on my side, and was glad thereof, though troubled that the office should fall upon me of disobliging Sir Richard.

1662-07-03 06:55   Writing over two copies of our contract with Sir W. Rider, &c., for 500 ton of hempe, which, because it is a secret, I have the trouble of writing over as well as drawing.


1662-07-02 13:50 r And to the Pay again, where I did relieve several of my Lord Sandwich’s people, but was sorry to see them so peremptory, and at every word would, complain to my Lord, as if they shall have such a command over my Lord.

1662-07-02 12:15 r Pett and I to the Pay, where Sir Williams both were paying off the Royal James still, and so to dinner.

1662-07-02 09:40 r Into the Store-house, and viewed the provisions there and then his books, but Mr. Davis himself was not there, he having a kinswoman in the house dead, for which, when by and by I saw him, he do trouble himself most ridiculously, as if there was never another woman in the world.

1662-07-02 07:02 r He in our passage taking notice how much difference there is between the old Captains for obedience and order, and the King’s new Captains, which I am very glad to hear him confess.

1662-07-02 06:25   By appointment, comes Commissioner Pett; and then a messenger from Mr. Coventry, who sits in his boat expecting us, and so we down to him at the Tower, and there took water all, and to Deptford.

1662-07-02 04:50   Up while the chimes went four, and to put down my journal, and so to my office, to read over such instructions as concern the officers of the Yard; for I am much upon seeing into the miscarriages there.


1662-07-01 20:59   After half an hour sitting talking with my wife, who was afeard I did intend to go with my Lord to fetch the Queen mother over, in which I did clear her doubts, I went to bed by daylight, in order to my rising early tomorrow.

1662-07-01 18:10 r To Redriffe by land, Mr. Cowly, the Clerk of the Cheque, with me, discoursing concerning the abuses of the yard, in which he did give me much light.

1662-07-01 15:21 r Seeing of Cooper, the mate of the ship, whom I knew in the Charles, I spoke to him about teaching the mathematiques, and do please myself in my thoughts of learning of him, and bade him come to me in a day or two.

1662-07-01 13:50 r I sent to my Lord to know whether she should be a first rate, as the men would have her, or a second. He answered that we should forbear paying the officers and such whose pay differed upon the rate of the ship, till he could speak with his Royal Highness.

1662-07-01 13:02   Captain Cuttance and I by water to Deptford, where the Royal James (in which my Lord went out the last voyage, though came back in the Charles) was paying off by Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen.
