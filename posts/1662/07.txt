1662-07-31 21:04 r I am now in town only with my man Will and Jane, and because my house is in building, I do lie at Sir W. Pen’s house, he being gone to Ireland. My wife, her maid and boy gone to Brampton.

1662-07-31 20:56   So home late, and it being the last day of the month, I did make up my accounts before I went to bed, and found myself worth about 650l., for which the Lord God be praised.

1662-07-31 15:08   We found Sir W. Batten going about his survey, but so poorly and unlike a survey of the Navy, that I am ashamed of it, and so is Mr. Coventry.

1662-07-31 11:47   To my office, and there we sat all the morning, where I begin more and more to grow considerable there.

1662-07-31 06:07   Up early and among my workmen, I ordering my rooms above, which will please me very well.


1662-07-30 20:31   About my business to the Rope-yard, repeating several trialls of the strength, wayte, waste, and other things of hemp, by which I have furnished myself enough to finish my intended business of stating the goodness of all sorts of hemp.

1662-07-30 10:59 r But the best was of one Mr. Rawlins, a courtier, that was with my Lord; and in the greatest danger cried, “God damn me, my Lord, I won’t give you three-pence for your place now.”

1662-07-30 10:49 r And his people do tell me how bravely my Lord did carry himself, while my Lord Crofts did cry; and I perceive it is all the town talk how poorly he carried himself.

1662-07-30 10:16   By water to White Hall, and there waited upon my Lord Sandwich; and joyed him, at his lodgings, of his safe coming home after all his danger, which he confesses to be very great.

1662-07-30 06:08   Cooper came to me and begun his lecture upon the body of a ship, which my having of a modell in the office is of great use to me, and very pleasant and useful it is.


1662-07-29 19:02   Walked to Deptford (Cooper with me talking of mathematiques), to send a fellow to prison for cutting of buoy ropes, and to see the difference between the flags sent in now-a-days, and I find the old ones, which were much cheaper, to be wholly as good.

1662-07-29 14:22 r Being invited I went with Sir George and Mr. Coventry to Sir W. Batten’s to dinner, and there merry, and very friendly to Sir Wm. and he to me, and complies much with me, but I know he envies me, and I do not value him.

1662-07-29 12:15 r Among other things I broached the business of our being abused about flags, which I know doth trouble Sir W. Batten, but I care not.

1662-07-29 12:07   Early up, and brought all my money, which is near 300l., out of my house into this chamber; and so to the office, and there we sat all the morning, Sir George Carteret and Mr. Coventry being come from sea.


1662-07-28 21:47   To my chamber a little troubled and melancholy, to my lute late, and so to bed, Will lying there at my feet, and the wench in my house in Will’s bed.

1662-07-28 07:48 r I walked to the waterside, and there took boat for the Tower; hearing that the Queen-Mother is come this morning already as high as Woolwich: and that my Lord Sandwich was with her; at which my heart was glad.

1662-07-28 06:41   With my wife to the George, at Holborn Conduit, where the coach stood ready to carry her and her maid to Bugden, but that not being ready, my brother Tom staid with them to see them gone, and so I took a troubled though willing goodbye, because of the bad condition of my house.


1662-07-27 15:52 r Meeting with Laud Crispe, I took him to the farther end, and sat under a tree in a corner, and there sung some songs, he singing well, but no skill, and so would sing false sometimes.

1662-07-27 15:03   By water I carried my wife to Westminster, where she went to take leave of her father, and I to walk in the Park, which is now every day more and more pleasant, by the new works upon it.


1662-07-26 17:40 r Thence to Mrs. Sarah, and there looked over my Lord’s lodgings, which are very pretty; and White Hall garden and the Bowling-ally (where lords and ladies are now at bowles), in brave condition.

1662-07-26 16:53   I went to Westminster; and there hear that the King and Queen intend to come to White Hall from Hampton Court next week, for all winter.

1662-07-26 15:30   I had a letter from Mr. Creed, who hath escaped narrowly in the King’s yacht, and got safe to the Downs after the late storm; and that there the King do tell him, that he is sure that my Lord is landed at Callis safe, of which being glad.

1662-07-26 14:21   To my office, causing the model hanging in my chamber to be taken down and hung up in my office, for fear of being spoilt by the workmen, and for my own convenience of studying it.


1662-07-25 11:44   At the office all the morning, reading Mr. Holland’s discourse of the Navy, lent me by Mr. Turner, and am much pleased with them, they hitting the very diseases of the Navy, which we are troubled with now-a-days. I shall bestow writing of them over and much reading thereof.


1662-07-24 21:07   To my office, where all the afternoon busy till 9 at night, among other things improving my late experiment at Woolwich about hemp.

1662-07-24 11:10 r I hear, to my great content, that my Lord Sandwich is safe landed in France.


1662-07-23 22:10   Much disturbed by reason of the talk up and down the town, that my Lord Sandwich is lost; but I trust in God the contrary.

1662-07-23 21:36   Late packing up things in order to their going to Brampton tomorrow, and so to bed, quite out of sorts in my mind by reason that the weather is so bad, and my house all full of wet, and the trouble of going from one house to another to Sir W. Pen’s upon every occasion.

1662-07-23 11:41   Being a little vexed that my brother Tom, by his neglect, do fail to get a coach for my wife and maid this week, by which she will not be at Brampton Feast, to meet my Lady at my father’s.

1662-07-23 08:49   This morning angry a little in the morning, and my house being so much out of order makes me a little pettish.


1662-07-22 13:58   At home at dinner, where I was highly angry with my wife for her keys being out of the way, but they were found at last, and so friends again.

1662-07-22 07:48 r But are all safe, only my Lord Sandwich, who went before with the yachts; they know not what is become of him, which do trouble me much; but I hope he got ashore before the storm begun; which God grant!

1662-07-22 07:37   I had letters from the Downs from Mr. Coventry; who tells me of the foul weather they had, that drove them back from near Boulogne, whither they were going for the Queen, back again to the Downs, with the loss of their cables, sayles, and masts.


1662-07-21 20:42   To my Lady’s, where we staid and supped with her, but found that my Lady was truly angry and discontented with us for our neglecting to see her as we used to do, but after a little she was pleased as she was used to be, at which we were glad.

1662-07-21 14:22 r Landing at the riverside, we walked to Greenwich, where to Cocke’s house again and walked in the garden, and then in to his lady, who was now vexed and did speak very discontented and angry to the Captain for disappointing a gentleman that he had invited to dinner.

1662-07-21 11:20 r But, good God! what a deal of company was there from both yards to help to do it, when half the company would have done it as well. But I see it is impossible for the King to have things done as cheap as other men.

1662-07-21 10:55 r We walked in Mr. Shelden’s garden, eating figs, which were very good, and talking while the Royal James was bringing towards the dock, and then we went out and saw the manner and trouble of docking such a ship, which yet they could not do but only brought her head into the Dock.

1662-07-21 09:38   To Woolwich to the Rope-yard; and there looked over several sorts of hemp, and did fall upon my great survey of seeing the working and experiments of the strength and the charge in the dressing of every sort.

1662-07-21 07:29 r He showed a great rarity, which was two or three of a great number of silver dishes and plates, which he bought of an embassador that did lack money, in the edge or rim of which was placed silver and gold medalls, very ancient, and I will show Mr. Crumlum them.

1662-07-21 05:37   Up early, and though I found myself out of order and cold, and the weather cold and likely to rain, yet upon my promise and desire to do what I intended, I did take boat and down to Greenwich, to Captain Cocke’s, who hath a most pleasant seat, and neat.


1662-07-20 21:20 r But what has vexed me today was that by carrying the key to Sir W. Pen’s last night, it could not in the midst of all my hurry to carry away my books and things, be found, and at last they found it in the fire that we made last night.

1662-07-20 20:29 r And so to Sir W. Pen’s to my chamber again, being all in dirt and foul, and in fear of having catched cold today with dabbling in the water.

1662-07-20 17:54 r All the afternoon we were putting up things in the further cellar against next week for them to be gone, and my wife and I into the office and there measured a soiled flag that I had found, and hope to get it to myself, for it has not been demanded since I came to the office.

1662-07-20 14:09 r I and my wife concluded to have her go and her two maids and the boy, and so there shall be none but Will and I left at home, and so the house will be freer, for it is impossible to have anybody come into my house while it is in this condition.

1662-07-20 10:15 r So I fitted myself for dirt, and removed all my books to the office and all day putting up and restoring things, it raining as hard within doors as without.

1662-07-20 07:32 r That which troubles me most is that it has rained so furiously that I fear my house is all over water, and with that expectation I rose and went into my house and find that it is as wet as the open street, and that there is not one dry-footing above nor below in my house.

1662-07-20 07:04   My wife and I lay talking long in bed, and at last she is come to be willing to stay two months in the country, for it is her unwillingness to stay till the house is quite done that makes me at a loss how to have her go or stay.


1662-07-19 22:04   To bed to a chamber at Sir W. Pen’s, my own house being so foul that I cannot lie there, and there the chamber lies so as that I come into it over my leads without going about, but yet I am not content with it, for there will be trouble to have servants running over the leads.

1662-07-19 16:33 r But methought it lessened my esteem of a king, that he should not be able to command the rain.

1662-07-19 16:29   I went upon the river to look after some tarr I am sending down and some coles, and so home again; it raining hard upon the water, I put ashore and sheltered myself, while the King came by in his barge, going down towards the Downs to meet the Queen.

1662-07-19 06:44 r And yet in some considerations I would be glad she was there, because of the dirtiness of my house and the trouble of having of a family there.

1662-07-19 06:41   Up early and to some business, and my wife coming to me I staid long with her discoursing about her going into the country, and as she is not very forward so am I at a great loss whether to have her go or no because of the charge.


1662-07-18 22:07   To bed, being much troubled at the rain coming into my house, the top being open.

1662-07-18 21:17   Comes Cooper for my mathematiques, but, in good earnest, my head is so full of business that I cannot understand it as otherwise I should do.

1662-07-18 12:28   By-and-by by water to Deptford, to put several things in order, being myself now only left in town, and so back again to the office, and there doing business all the morning.

1662-07-18 05:01   Up very early, and got a-top of my house, seeing the design of my work, and like it very well, and it comes into my head to have my dining-room wainscoated, which will be very pretty.


1662-07-17 23:20   Very late I was forced to send for Mr. Turner, Smith, Young, about things to be sent down early tomorrow on board the King’s pleasure boat, and so to bed with my head full of business, but well contented in mind as ever in my life.

1662-07-17 22:55   Found much business to be upon my hands, and was late at the office writing letters by candle light, which is rare at this time of the year, but I do it with much content and joy, and then I do please me that I begin to have people direct themselves to me in all businesses.

1662-07-17 15:32   To my Lord’s, where I presented him with a true state of all his accounts to the 14th of July, which did please him, and to my great joy I continue in his great esteem and opinion.


1662-07-16 17:08 r We went to Mr. Creed’s lodging, and there got a dish or two of sweetmeats, and I seeing a very neat leaden standish to carry papers, pen, and ink in when one travels I also got that of him.

1662-07-16 14:48   I dined with Mr. Moore and the people below, who after dinner fell to talk of Portugall rings, and Captain Ferrers offered five or six to sell, and I seeming to like a ring made of a coco-nutt with a stone done in it, he did offer and would give it me.

1662-07-16 10:22   To my office, and by and by came Mr. Moore to me, and so I went home and consulted about drawing up a fair state of all my Lord’s accounts, which being settled, he went away, and I fell to writing of it very neatly, and it was very handsome and concisely done.

1662-07-16 05:52 r I found all my ceilings, spoiled with rain last night, so that I fear they must be all new whited when the work is done.


1662-07-15 21:07   It fell a-raining, and the house being all open at top, it vexed me; but there was no help for it.

1662-07-15 18:10   Comes Mr. Cooper, and I took him by water on purpose to tell me things belonging to ships, which was time well spent.


1662-07-14 20:08   My house being this day almost quite untiled in order to its rising higher. This night I began to put on my waistcoat also.

1662-07-14 10:48   I found the pageant in Cornhill taken down, which was pretty strange.

1662-07-14 09:33   To Thames Street along with old Mr. Green, among the tarr-men, and did instruct myself in the nature and prices of tarr, but could not get Stockholm for the use of the office under 10l. 15s. per last, which is a great price.


1662-07-13 20:40 r I did discourse with Mr. Turner about the faults of our management of the business of our office, of which he is sensible, but I believe is a very knave.

1662-07-13 18:18   I told Mr. Turner my whole mind, and how it was in my power to do him a discourtesy about his place of petty purveyance, and at last did make him see (I think) that it was his concernment to be friendly to me and what belongs to me.

1662-07-13 14:59   I set about taking down my books and papers and making my chamber fit against tomorrow to have the people come to work in pulling down the top of my house.

1662-07-13 11:49   Having by some mischance hurt my cods, I had my old pain all yesterday and this morning, and so kept my bed all this morning.


1662-07-12 07:28   Up by five o’clock, and put things in my house in order to be laid up, against my workmen come on Monday to take down the top of my house, which trouble I must go through now, but it troubles me much to think of it.


1662-07-11 15:40 r Fell to discourse of business and regulation, and do think of many things that will put matters into better order, and my heart rejoices to see Mr. Coventry so ingenious, and able, and studious to do good, and with much frankness and respect to Mr. Pett and myself particularly.

1662-07-11 13:38 r Then to the Ropeyard, and there viewed the hemp, wherein we found great corruption, and then saw a trial between Sir R. Ford’s yarn and our own, and found great odds.

1662-07-11 09:54 r To Woolwich, and viewed well all the houses and stores there, which lie in very great confusion for want of storehouses, and then to Mr. Ackworth’s and Sheldon’s to view their books, which we found not to answer the King’s service and security at all as to the stores.

1662-07-11 07:53   Down to Deptford first, and there viewed some deals lately served in at a low price, which our officers, like knaves, would untruly value in their worth, but we found them good.

1662-07-11 05:13   Up by four o’clock, and hard at my multiplicacion-table, which I am now almost master of, and so made me ready and to my office.


1662-07-10 11:58   So to the office all the morning, where very much business, but it vexes me to see so much disorder at our table, that, every man minding a several business, we dispatch nothing.

1662-07-10 05:57   Up by four o’clock, and before I went to the office I practised my arithmetique, and then, when my wife was up, did call her and Sarah, and did make up a difference between them, for she is so good a servant as I am loth to part with her.


1662-07-09 15:49   My wife with me, and she was talking to me about her going to Brampton, which I would willingly have her to do but for the cost of it, and to stay here will be very inconvenient because of the dirt that I must have when my house is pulled down.

1662-07-09 11:38 r I did, God forgive me! promise him all my service and love, though the rogue knows he deserves none from me, nor do I intend to show him any; but as he dissembles with me, so must I with him.

1662-07-09 11:29   Sir W. Pen came to my office to take his leave of me, and desiring a turn in the garden, did commit the care of his building to me, and offered all his services to me in all matters of mine.

1662-07-09 04:27   Up by four o’clock, and at my multiplicacion-table hard, which is all the trouble I meet withal in my arithmetique.


1662-07-08 17:02 r My Lord do seem still to have his old confidence in me; and tells me to boot, that Mr. Coventry hath spoke of me to him to great advantage; wherein I am much pleased.

1662-07-08 15:28   In all haste to make up my accounts with my Lord, which I did with some trouble, because I had some hopes to have made a profit to myself in this account and above what was due to me (which God forgive me in), but I could not.


1662-07-07 12:10   My morning’s work at the office was to put the new books of my office into order, and writing on the backsides what books they be, and transcribing out of some old books some things into them.


1662-07-06 17:48   To supper with my Lady, who tells me, with much trouble, that my Lady Castlemaine is still as great with the King, and that the King comes as often to her as ever he did, at which, God forgive me, I am well pleased.

1662-07-06 09:05   Lay long in bed today with my wife merry and pleasant, and then rose and settled my accounts with my wife for housekeeping, and do see that my kitchen, besides wine, fire, candle, sope, and many other things, comes to about 30s. a week, or a little over.


1662-07-05 21:20   So at my office all the afternoon, and then my mathematiques at night with Mr. Cooper, and so to supper and to bed.

1662-07-05 14:38 r Above all things it is considerable that my mind was never in my life in so good a condition of quiet as it has been since I have followed my business and seen myself to get greater and greater fitness in my employment, and honour every day more than other.

1662-07-05 14:32   Mr. Creed would, with all his rhetoric, have persuaded me to have gone to a play; and I find my nature desirous to have gone, notwithstanding my promise and my business, to which I have lately kept myself so close, but I did refuse it, and I hope shall ever do so.

1662-07-05 13:44 r I having some venison given me a day or two ago, and so I had a shoulder roasted, another baked, and the umbles baked in a pie, and all very well done. We were merry as I could be in that company.

1662-07-05 12:23   We had Sir W. Pen, who I hate with all my heart for his base treacherous tricks, but yet I think it not policy to declare it yet, and his son William, to my house to dinner, where was also Mr. Creed and my cozen Harry Alcocke.


1662-07-04 17:10   I sent my brother Tom, at his request, my father’s old Bass Viall which he and I have kept so long, but I fear Tom will do little good at it.

1662-07-04 14:22 r From that we fell to discourse of Sir W. Batten’s corruption and the people that he employs, and from one discourse to another of the kind. I was much pleased with his company.

1662-07-04 12:05   Sir W. Warren did come to me about business, and did begin to instruct me in the nature of fine timber and deals, telling me the nature of every sort.

1662-07-04 07:50 r After an hour’s being with him at arithmetique (my first attempt being to learn the multiplication-table); then we parted till tomorrow.

1662-07-04 06:42   Comes Mr. Cooper, mate of the Royall Charles, of whom I intend to learn mathematiques, and do begin with him today, he being a very able man, and no great matter, I suppose, will content him.


1662-07-03 21:00   After a turn or two upon the leads with my wife, who has lately had but little of my company, since I begun to follow my business, but is contented therewith since she sees how I spend my time, and so to bed.

1662-07-03 19:17 r Wherein he stated the government of the Chest to me; and upon the whole did tell me how it hath ever been abused, and to this day is; and what a meritorious act it would be to look after it; which I am resolved to do, if God bless me; and do thank him very much for it.

1662-07-03 19:14   Came Mr. Lewis to me, and very ingeniously did enquire whether I ever did look into the business of the Chest at Chatham; and after my readiness to be informed did appear to him, he did produce a paper.

1662-07-03 15:13   Was brought to Sir W. Compton a gun to discharge seven times, the best of all devices that ever I saw, and very serviceable, and not a bawble; for it is much approved of, and many thereof made.

1662-07-03 14:21 r We all by invitation dined at the Dolphin with the Officers of the Ordnance; where Sir W. Compton, Mr. O’Neale, and other great persons, were, and a very great dinner, but I drank as I still do but my allowance of wine.

1662-07-03 09:10 r Home to dress myself, and so to the office, where another fray between Sir R. Ford and myself about his yarn, wherein I find the board to yield on my side, and was glad thereof, though troubled that the office should fall upon me of disobliging Sir Richard.

1662-07-03 06:55   Writing over two copies of our contract with Sir W. Rider, &c., for 500 ton of hempe, which, because it is a secret, I have the trouble of writing over as well as drawing.


1662-07-02 13:50 r And to the Pay again, where I did relieve several of my Lord Sandwich’s people, but was sorry to see them so peremptory, and at every word would, complain to my Lord, as if they shall have such a command over my Lord.

1662-07-02 12:15 r Pett and I to the Pay, where Sir Williams both were paying off the Royal James still, and so to dinner.

1662-07-02 09:40 r Into the Store-house, and viewed the provisions there and then his books, but Mr. Davis himself was not there, he having a kinswoman in the house dead, for which, when by and by I saw him, he do trouble himself most ridiculously, as if there was never another woman in the world.

1662-07-02 07:02 r He in our passage taking notice how much difference there is between the old Captains for obedience and order, and the King’s new Captains, which I am very glad to hear him confess.

1662-07-02 06:25   By appointment, comes Commissioner Pett; and then a messenger from Mr. Coventry, who sits in his boat expecting us, and so we down to him at the Tower, and there took water all, and to Deptford.

1662-07-02 04:50   Up while the chimes went four, and to put down my journal, and so to my office, to read over such instructions as concern the officers of the Yard; for I am much upon seeing into the miscarriages there.


1662-07-01 20:59   After half an hour sitting talking with my wife, who was afeard I did intend to go with my Lord to fetch the Queen mother over, in which I did clear her doubts, I went to bed by daylight, in order to my rising early tomorrow.

1662-07-01 18:10 r To Redriffe by land, Mr. Cowly, the Clerk of the Cheque, with me, discoursing concerning the abuses of the yard, in which he did give me much light.

1662-07-01 15:21 r Seeing of Cooper, the mate of the ship, whom I knew in the Charles, I spoke to him about teaching the mathematiques, and do please myself in my thoughts of learning of him, and bade him come to me in a day or two.

1662-07-01 13:50 r I sent to my Lord to know whether she should be a first rate, as the men would have her, or a second. He answered that we should forbear paying the officers and such whose pay differed upon the rate of the ship, till he could speak with his Royal Highness.

1662-07-01 13:02   Captain Cuttance and I by water to Deptford, where the Royal James (in which my Lord went out the last voyage, though came back in the Charles) was paying off by Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen.
