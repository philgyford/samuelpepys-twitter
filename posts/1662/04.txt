1662-04-30 16:50 r I went to the ladies, and there took them and walked to the Mayor’s to show them the present, and then to the Dock, where Mr. Tippets made much of them, and thence back again, the Doctor being come to us to their lodgings.

1662-04-30 14:50 r After dinner walk to Portsmouth, there to pay off the Success, which we did pretty early, and so I took leave of Sir W. Pen, he desiring to know whither I went, but I would not tell him.

1662-04-30 11:30   Sir G. Carteret came down to the yard, and there we mustered over all the men and determined of some regulations in the yard.


1662-04-29 22:20 r So we walked to the yard, designing how to prevent our going to London tomorrow, that we might be merry with these ladies, which I did.

1662-04-29 22:00 r So I appointed one to watch when the gates of the town were ready to be shut, and to give us notice; and so the Doctor and I staid with them playing and laughing, and at last were forced to bid good night for fear of being locked into the town all night.

1662-04-29 18:50 r Then comes the Doctor, and we carried them by coach to their lodging, which was very poor, but the best they could get, and such as made much mirth among us.

1662-04-29 16:40   Sir G. Carteret, Sir W. Pen and I walked forth, and I spied Mrs. Pierce and another lady passing by. So I left them and went to the ladies, and walked with them up and down, and took them to Mrs. Stephens, and there gave them wine and sweetmeats, and were very merry.


1662-04-28 09:10   The Doctor and I begun philosophy discourse exceeding pleasant. He offers to bring me into the college of virtuosoes and my Lord Brouncker’s acquaintance, and to show me some anatomy, which makes me very glad; and I shall endeavour it when I come to London.


1662-04-27 16:50 r Back again by coach to Portsmouth, and then visited the Mayor, Mr. Timbrell, our anchor-smith, who showed us the present they have for the Queen; which is a salt-sellar of silver, the walls christall, with four eagles and four greyhounds standing up at the top to bear up a dish.

1662-04-27 14:40 r After dinner Sir W. Batten and I, the Doctor, and Ned Pickering by coach to the Yard, and there on board the Swallow in the dock hear our navy chaplain preach a sad sermon, full of nonsense and false Latin; but prayed for the Right Honourable the principal officers.

1662-04-27 11:10 r At chappell we had a most excellent and eloquent sermon. And here I spoke and saluted Mrs. Pierce, but being in haste could not learn of her where her lodgings are, which vexes me.

1662-04-27 11:00 r So I rode to church, and met my Lord Chamberlain upon the walls of the garrison, who owned and spoke to me. I followed him in the crowd of gallants through the Queen’s lodgings to chappell; the rooms being all rarely furnished, and escaped hardly being set on fire yesterday.

1662-04-27 07:30   Sir W. Pen got trimmed before me, and so took the coach to Portsmouth to wait on my Lord Steward to church, and sent the coach for me back again.


1662-04-26 16:20 r After dinner to horse again, being in nothing troubled but the badness of my hat, which I borrowed to save my beaver.

1662-04-26 15:50 r The towne is one most gallant street, and is walled round with stone, &c., and Bevis’s picture upon one of the gates; many old walls of religious houses, and the key, well worth seeing.

1662-04-26 14:40 r They brought us also some caveare, which I attempted to order, but all to no purpose, for they had neither given it salt enough, nor are the seedes of the roe broke, but are all in berryes.

1662-04-26 14:10 r At Southampton we went to the Mayor’s and there dined, and had sturgeon of their own catching the last week, which do not happen in twenty years, and it was well ordered.

1662-04-26 11:00 r In our way, besides my Lord Southampton’s parks and lands, which in one view we could see 6,000l. per annum, we observed a little church-yard, where the graves are accustomed to be all sowed with sage.

1662-04-26 09:10   Sir George and I, and his clerk Mr. Stephens, and Mr. Holt our guide, over to Gosport; and so rode to Southampton.


1662-04-25 22:40 r Got the Doctor to go lie with me, and much pleased with his company; but I was much troubled in my eyes, by reason of the healths I have this day been forced to drink.

1662-04-25 14:20   All the morning at Portsmouth, at the Pay, and then to dinner, and again to the Pay.


1662-04-24 22:20 r W. Pen and I walked to the King’s Yard, and there lay at Mr. Tippets’s, where exceeding well treated.

1662-04-24 10:20 r All of us to the Pay-house; but the books not being ready, we went to church to the lecture, where there was my Lord Ormond and Manchester, and much London company, though not so much as I expected.

1662-04-24 08:20 r We lay very well and merrily; in the morning, concluding him to be of the eldest blood and house of the Clerkes, because that all the fleas came to him and not to me.


1662-04-23 22:40 r The Doctor and I lay together at Wiard’s, the chyrurgeon’s, in Portsmouth, his wife a very pretty woman.

1662-04-23 18:10 r Upon our coming we sent away an express to Sir W. Batten to stop his coming, which I did project to make good my oath, that my wife should come if any of our wives came, which my Lady Batten did intend to do with her husband.

1662-04-23 13:30   Up early, and to Petersfield, and there dined well; and thence got a countryman to guide us by Havant, to avoid going through the Forest; but he carried us much out of the way.


1662-04-22 19:30 r We came to Gilford and there passed our time in the garden, cutting of sparagus for supper, the best that ever I eat in my life but in the house last year.

1662-04-22 15:40 r He, among good Storys, telling us a story of the monkey that got hold of the young lady’s cunt as she went to stool to shit, and run from under her coats and got upon the table, which was ready laid for supper after dancing was done.

1662-04-22 09:30 r Here we got a dish of buttered eggs, and there staid till Sir G. Carteret came to us from White Hall, who brought Dr. Clerke with him, at which I was very glad, and so we set out, and I was very much pleased with his company.

1662-04-22 07:40   After taking leave of my wife, which we could hardly do kindly, because of her mind to go along with me, Sir W. Pen and I took coach and so over the bridge to Lambeth, W. Bodham and Tom Hewet going as clerks to Sir W. Pen, and my Will for me.


1662-04-21 15:50   My Lord Crew told me that news was come that the Queen is landed; at which I took leave, and by coach hurried to White Hall, the bells ringing in several places; but I found there no such matter, nor anything like it.

1662-04-21 13:40   Sir Thos. Crew tells me how my Lady Duchess of Richmond and Castlemaine had a falling out the other day; and she calls the latter Jane Shore, and did hope to see her come to the same end that she did.

1662-04-21 06:45   I attempted to persuade my wife in bed to go to Brampton this week, but she would not, which troubles me, and seeing that I could keep it no longer from her, I told her that I was resolved to go to Portsmouth tomorrow.


1662-04-20 20:50 r Walked home with Mr. Blagrave to his old house in the Fishyard, and there he had a pretty kinswoman that sings, and we did sing some holy things, and afterwards others came in and so I left them, and by water through the bridge (which did trouble me) home.

1662-04-20 15:20   To White Hall to Sir G. Carteret, and so to the Chappell, where I challenged my pew as Clerk of the Privy Seal and had it.

1662-04-20 09:30   My intention being to go this morning to White Hall to hear South, my Lord Chancellor’s chaplain, the famous preacher and oratour of Oxford, it did rain, and the wind against me, that I could by no means get a boat or coach to carry me.


1662-04-19 19:40   I did get a bever, an old one, but a very good one, of Sir W. Batten, for which I must give him something; but I am very well pleased with it.

1662-04-19 09:10   I went to Aldgate, and did see Barkestead, Okey, and Corbet, drawn towards the gallows at Tiburne; and there they were hanged and quartered. They all looked very cheerful; but I hear they all die defending what they did to the King to be just; which is very strange.


1662-04-18 11:55   Sir G. Carteret, Sir W. Batten and I met at the office, and did conclude of our going to Portsmouth next week, in which my mind is at a great loss what to do with my wife, for I cannot persuade her to go to Brampton, and I am loth to leave her at home.

1662-04-18 10:00 r So I forebore, and afterwards, in my wife’s chamber, did there talk to Jane how much I did love the boy for her sake, and how much it do concern to correct the boy for his faults, or else he would be undone. So at last she was well pleased.

1662-04-18 09:40   Sending the boy into the cellar for some beer I followed him with a cane and did there beat him for his staying of arrands and other faults, and his sister came to me down and begged for him.


1662-04-17 19:50   Sir W. Batten sent for me to tell me that he had this day spoke to the Duke about raising our houses, and he hath given us leave to do it, at which, being glad, I went home merry,

1662-04-17 09:10   To Mr. Holliard’s in the morning, thinking to be let blood, but he was gone out.


1662-04-16 11:40   Up early and took my physique; it wrought all the morning well.


1662-04-15 18:00   With my wife, by coach, to the New Exchange, to buy her some things; where we saw some new-fashion pettycoats of sarcenett, with a black broad lace printed round the bottom and before, very handsome, and my wife had a mind to one of them, but we did not then buy one.


1662-04-14 20:22 r And yet all my design was that I might the freer go to Portsmouth when the rest go to pay off the yards there, which will be very shortly. But I will get off if I can.

1662-04-14 20:20   So home and walked upon the leads with my wife, and whether she suspected anything or no I know not, but she is quite off of her going to Brampton, which something troubles me.

1662-04-14 18:00 r To Paternoster Row to buy things for my wife against her going.

1662-04-14 16:10 r We to the Paynter’s, and there sat the last time for my little picture, which I hope will please me.

1662-04-14 09:20   Being weary last night I lay very long in bed, talking with my wife, and persuaded her to go to Brampton, and take Sarah with her, next week, to cure her ague by change of ayre, and we agreed all things therein.


1662-04-13 21:22 r I took Sir William to Sir W. Pen’s (who was newly come from Walthamstow), and there we read it and discoursed, but we do not much fear it, the King referring it to the Duke of York.

1662-04-13 21:00   Sir W. Warren comes to me to bring me a paper of Field’s (with whom we have lately had a great deal of trouble at the office) being a bitter petition to the King against our office for not doing justice upon his complaint to us of embezzlement of the King’s stores by one Turpin.

1662-04-13 20:20 r His discourse most about the pride of the Duchess of York; and how all the ladies envy my Lady Castlemaine. He intends to go to Portsmouth to meet the Queen this week; which is now the discourse and expectation of the town.

1662-04-13 20:05   To Graye’s Inn walkes; and there met Mr. Pickering and walked with him two hours till I was quite weary.

1662-04-13 15:40   I went to the Temple to Church, and there heard another: by the same token a boy, being asleep, fell down a high seat to the ground, ready to break his neck, but got no hurt.


1662-04-12 16:30   Home and wrote letters at my office, and one to Mr. Coventry about business, and at the close did excuse my not waiting on him myself so often as others do for want of leisure.

1662-04-12 11:40   Being provoked by some impertinence of Sir W. Batten’s, I called him unreasonable man, at which he was very angry and so was I, but I think we shall not much fall out about it.


1662-04-11 22:50 r And so home and walked with my wife on the leads late, and so the barber came to me, and so to bed very weary, which I seldom am.

1662-04-11 13:10 r And so back to Greenwich by water, and there while something is dressing for our dinner, Sir William and I walked into the Park, where the King hath planted trees and made steps in the hill up to the Castle, which is very magnificent.

1662-04-11 10:20 r Captn. Minnes and the other Captains that were with us tell me that negros drowned look white and lose their blackness, which I never heard before.

1662-04-11 06:10   With Sir W. Pen by water to Deptford; and among the ships now going to Portugall with men and horse, to see them dispatched.

1662-04-11 05:30   Up early to my lute and a song.


1662-04-10 22:40   Late at the office. Home with my mind full of business. So to bed.

1662-04-10 15:56   My Lord Windsor came to us to discourse of his affairs, and to take his leave of us; he being to go Governor of Jamaica with this fleet that is now going.

1662-04-10 13:30   Yesterday came Col. Talbot with letters from Portugall, that the Queen is resolved to embarque for England this week.


1662-04-09 13:10 r Sir George showed me an account in French of the great famine, which is to the greatest extremity in some part of France at this day, which is very strange.

1662-04-09 12:50   All the morning at the office passing the Victualler’s accounts, and at noon to dinner at the Dolphin, where a good chine of beef and other good cheer.


1662-04-08 20:30   By the way home and on Ludgate Hill there being a stop I bought two cakes, and they were our supper at home.

1662-04-08 13:10   So to dinner, and in comes uncle Fenner and the two Joyces. I sent for a barrel of oysters and a breast of veal roasted, and were very merry; but I cannot down with their dull company and impertinent.


1662-04-07 21:10   The great talk is, that the Spaniards and the Hollanders do intend to set upon the Portuguese by sea, at Lisbon, as soon as our fleet is come away; and by that means our fleet is not likely to come yet these two months or three; which I hope is not true.

1662-04-07 16:10 r And so home to my office, and there did promise to drink no more wine but one glass a meal till Whitsuntide next upon any score.

1662-04-07 14:20   Found out my uncle Wight and Mr. Rawlinson, and with them went to the latter’s house to dinner, and there had a good dinner of cold meat and good wine, but was troubled in my head after the little wine I drank.

1662-04-07 10:00 r I sent in a note to my Lord Privy Seal, and he came out to me; and I desired he would make another deputy for me, because of my great business of the Navy this month; but he told me he could not do it without the King’s consent, which vexed me.

1662-04-07 09:30   To the Lords’ House, and stood within the House, while the Bishops and Lords did stay till the Chancellor’s coming, and then we were put out, and they to prayers.


1662-04-06 17:40 r Thence to walk in the Park, where the King and Duke did walk round the Park. After I was tired I went and took boat to Milford stairs, and so to Graye’s Inn walks, the first time I have been there this year, and it is very pleasant and full of good company.

1662-04-06 14:30 r So up and saw the King at dinner; and thence with Sir G. Carteret to dinner, with him and his lady, where I saluted her, and was well received as a stranger by her; she seems a good lady, and all their discourse was upon their sufferings and services for the King.

1662-04-06 11:23 r Among other things, did much insist upon the sin of adultery: which methought might touch the King, and the more because he forced it into his sermon, methinks, besides his text.

1662-04-06 11:20   Thence to the Chappell, and there, though crowded, heard a very honest sermon before the King by a Canon of Christ Church, upon these words, “Having a form of godliness, but denying,” &c.

1662-04-06 09:40   By water to White Hall, to Sir G. Carteret, to give him an account of the backwardness of the ships we have hired to Portugall. At which he is much troubled.


1662-04-05 20:00   By coach first to Moorfields and there walked, and thence to Islington and had a fine walk in the fields there.

1662-04-05 15:50   Sir W. Batten and I had viewed our houses with a workman in order to the raising of our roofs higher to enlarge our houses.

1662-04-05 12:35   Sir G. Carteret and I walked together alone in the garden, taking notice of some faults in the office, particularly of Sir W. Batten’s, and he seemed to be much pleased with me, and I hope will be the ground of a future interest of mine in him, which I shall be glad of.


1662-04-04 16:30 r I was much troubled to see a dead man lie floating upon the waters, and had done (they say) these four days, and nobody takes him up to bury him, which is very barbarous.

1662-04-04 13:10   By barge Sir George, Sir Williams both and I to Deptford, and there fell to pay off the Drake and Hampshire, then to dinner, Sir George to his lady at his house, and Sir Wm. Pen to Woolwich, and Sir W. Batten and I to the tavern, where much company came to us and our dinner.


1662-04-03 18:30   At home and at the office all day.


1662-04-02 17:55 r Met Mr. Sanchy, Smithes, Gale, and Edlin at the play, but having no great mind to spend money, I left them there.

1662-04-02 17:40   My wife and I by water to the Opera and there saw “The Bondman” most excellently acted; and though we had seen it so often, yet I never liked it better than today, Ianthe acting Cleora’s part very well now Roxalana is gone. We are resolved to see no more plays till Whitsuntide.

1662-04-02 11:35 r We got places and staid to hear a sermon; but, it being a Presbyterian one, it was so long, that after above an hour of it we went away.

1662-04-02 10:15   Mr. Moore came to me, and he and I walked to the Spittle an hour or two before my Lord Mayor and the blewcoat boys come, which at last they did, and a fine sight of charity it is indeed.


1662-04-01 19:40 r In their coach I took them to Islington, and then, after a walk in the fields, I took them to the great cheese-cake house and entertained them, and so home.

1662-04-01 15:15 r In the middle of the play my Lady Paulina, who had taken physique this morning, had need to go forth, and so I took the poor lady out and carried her to the Grange, and there sent the maid of the house into a room to her, and she did what she had a mind to, and so back.

1662-04-01 14:20 r Mr. Herbert and I and the two young ladies and my wife to the playhouse, the Opera, and saw “The Mayde in the Mill,” a pretty good play.

1662-04-01 12:10   My wife and I (having paid our maid Nell her whole wages, who has been with me half a year, and now goes away for altogether) to the Wardrobe, where my Lady and company had almost dined.
