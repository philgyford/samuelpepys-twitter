1662-06-30 21:48   This I take to be as bad a juncture as ever I observed.

1662-06-30 19:30 r Went first on board the King’s pleasure boat. Then to Greenwich Park; and with much ado she was able to walk up to the top of the hill, and so down again, and took boat, and so through bridge to Blackfryers, she being much pleased with the ramble in every particular of it.

1662-06-30 17:42 r Thence to my house, where I took great pride to lead her through the Court by the hand, she being very fine, and her page carrying up her train.

1662-06-30 16:31   Among other things told my Lady Carteret how my Lady Fanshaw is fallen out with her only for speaking in behalf of the French, which my Lady wonders at, they having been formerly like sisters, but we see there is no true lasting friendship in the world.

1662-06-30 06:10 r She being gone, I fell upon boring holes for me to see from my closet into the great office, without going forth, wherein I please myself much.

1662-06-30 05:03   Up betimes, and to my office, where I found Griffen’s girl making it clean, but, God forgive me! what a mind I had to her, but did not meddle with her.


1662-06-29 20:48   Sir W. Penn do much fawn upon me, and I perceive would not fall out with me, and his daughter mighty officious to my wife, but I shall never be deceived again by him, but do hate him and his traitorous tricks with all my heart.

1662-06-29 11:27   To church with my wife, who this day put on her green petticoat of flowred satin, with fine white and gimp lace of her own putting on, which is very pretty.

1662-06-29 05:42   To the settling of my own accounts, and I do find upon my monthly ballance, which I have undertaken to keep from month to month, that I am worth 650l., the greatest sum that ever I was yet master of. I pray God give me a thankfull, spirit, and care to improve and encrease it.


1662-06-28 21:54 r I find it to be the very effect of my late oaths against wine and plays, which, if God please, I will keep constant in, for now my business is a delight to me, and brings me great credit, and my purse encreases too.

1662-06-28 21:52   My mind is now in a wonderful condition of quiet and content, more than ever in all my life, since my minding the business of my office, which I have done most constantly.

1662-06-28 21:30   This day genteel woman came to me, claiming kindred of me, as she had once done before, and borrowed 10s. of me, promising to repay it at night, but I hear nothing of her. I shall trust her no more.

1662-06-28 16:14 r Though, God knows! the King is not able to set out five ships at this present without great difficulty, we neither having money, credit, nor stores.

1662-06-28 16:10   Great talk there is of a fear of a war with the Dutch; and we have order to pitch upon twenty ships to be forthwith set out; but I hope it is but a scarecrow to the world, to let them see that we can be ready for them.


1662-06-27 21:31   Mr. Holliard had been with my wife to-day, and cured her of her pain in her ear by taking out a most prodigious quantity of hard wax that had hardened itself in the bottom of the ear, of which I am very glad.

1662-06-27 15:19   Comes Sir J. Minnes and some captains with him, who had been at a Councill of Warr today, who tell us they have acquitted Captain Hall, who was accused of cowardice in letting of old Winter, the Argier pyrate, go away from him with a prize or two.

1662-06-27 07:48   My Lord’s greatest design is, first, to get clear of all debts to the King for the Embassy money, and then a pardon. Then, to get his land settled; and then to, discourse and advise what is best for him, whether to keep his sea employment longer or no.


1662-06-26 13:30   Took Commissioner Pett home to dinner with me, where my stomach was turned when my sturgeon came to table, upon which I saw very many little worms creeping, which I suppose was through the staleness of the pickle.

1662-06-26 05:21   Up and took physique, but such as to go abroad with, only to loosen me, for I am bound.


1662-06-25 21:37   My wife having lately a great pain in her ear, for which this night she begins to take physique, and I have got cold and so have a great deal of my old pain.

1662-06-25 10:02   I into Thames Street, beyond the Bridge, and there enquired among the shops the price of tarre and oyle, and do find great content in it, and hope to save the King money by this practice.


1662-06-24 22:12   Mr. Spong came to me, and so he and I sat singing upon the leads till almost ten at night and so he went away (a pretty, harmless, and ingenious man), and I to bed, in a very great content of mind, which I hope by my care still in my business will continue to me.

1662-06-24 20:31   Field the rogue hath cast me at Guildhall in 30l. for his imprisonment, to which I signed his commitment with the rest of the officers; but they having been parliament-men, that he hath begun the law with me; and threatens more, but I hope the Duke of York will bear me out.

1662-06-24 12:33   Sat all the morning, and I bless God I find that by my diligence of late and still, I do get ground in the office every day.


1662-06-23 19:24 r From on board he took me to his yard, where vast and many places of deals, sparrs, and bulks, &c., the difference between which I never knew before, and indeed am very proud of this evening’s work.

1662-06-23 18:45 r And told me pleasant notions concerning their manner of cutting and sawing them by watermills, and the reason how deals become dearer and cheaper when the snow is not so great as to fill up the values that they may pass from hill to hill over the snow, then it is dear carriage.

1662-06-23 18:29   Sir W. Warren came to me about business, and that being done, discoursing of deals, I did offer to go along with him among his deal ships, which we did to half a score, where he showed me the difference between Dram, Swinsound, Christiania, and others.

1662-06-23 06:38   Up early, this morning, and my people are taking down the hangings and things in my house because of the great dust that is already made by the pulling down of Sir W. Batten’s house, and will be by my own when I come to it.


1662-06-22 21:40   My wife and I to walk in the garden, where all our talk was against Sir W. Pen, against whom I have had cause to be much prejudiced. By and by he and his daughter came out to walk, so we took no notice of them, at last in going home spoke a word or two, and so good night.

1662-06-22 18:21 r He told me that certainly Sir H. Vane must be gone to Heaven, for he died as much a martyr and saint as ever man did; and that the King hath lost more by that man’s death, than he will get again a good while.

1662-06-22 18:03   I met with Will. Swan, who do talk as high for the Fanatiques as ever he did in his life; and do pity my Lord Sandwich and me that we should be given up to the wickedness of the world; and that a fall is coming upon us all.

1662-06-22 10:07   I am told of a Portugall lady, at Hampton Court, that hath dropped a child already since the Queen’s coming, but the king would not have them searched whose it is; and so it is not commonly known yet.


1662-06-21 21:32 r So to bed, with my arm very weary.

1662-06-21 21:20 r I confess it is one of the greatest wonders that ever I met with that such a little boy as he could possibly be able to suffer half so much as he did to maintain a lie. I think I must be forced to put him away.

1662-06-21 21:08 r Not willing to let him go away a conqueror, I took him in task again, and pulled off his frock to his shirt, and whipped him till he did confess that he did drink the whey, and did lay the candlestick upon the ground in his chamber, which he had denied this quarter of a year.

1662-06-21 20:57   I hearing from my wife and the maids’ complaints made of the boy, I called him up, and with my whip did whip him till I was not able to stir, and yet I could not make him confess any of the lies that they tax him with.

1662-06-21 18:42   Home, and there found Mr. Creed, who staid talking with my wife and me an hour or two, and I put on my riding cloth suit, only for him to see how it is, and I think it will do very well.

1662-06-21 12:41   The Lieutenant of the Tower, upon my demanding how Sir H. Vane died, told me that he died in a passion; but all confess with so much courage as never man died.


1662-06-20 19:46   My wife and I and Jane over the water to the Halfway-house, a pretty, pleasant walk, but the wind high.

1662-06-20 11:58   To Pope’s Head Ally, and there bought me a pair of tweezers, cost me 14s., the first thing like a bawble I have bought a good while, but I do it with some trouble of mind.

1662-06-20 10:11   I went to the Exchange, and hear that the merchants have a great fear of a breach with the Spaniard; for they think he will not brook our having Tangier, Dunkirk, and Jamaica; and our merchants begin to draw home their estates as fast as they can.

1662-06-20 07:08 r I do perceive that I am very short in my business by not knowing many times the geographical part of my business.

1662-06-20 06:59 r That done, I turned to the Forrest of Deane, in Speede’s Mapps, and there he showed me how it lies; and the Lea-bayly, with the great charge of carrying it to Lydny, and many other things worth my knowing.

1662-06-20 06:08   To the office, and there drew up the agreement between the King and Sir John Winter about the Forrest of Deane; and having done it, he came himself; and we read it, and both liked it well.


1662-06-19 20:35   So home and at the office preparing papers and things, and indeed my head has not been so full of business a great while, and with so much pleasure, for I begin to see the pleasure it gives. God give me health.

1662-06-19 13:03   We sat long to-day, and had a great private business before us about contracting with Sir W. Rider, Mr. Cutler, and Captain Cocke, for 500 ton of hemp, which we went through, and I am to draw up the conditions.

1662-06-19 05:32   Up by five o’clock, and while my man Will was getting himself ready to come up to me I took and played upon my lute a little.


1662-06-18 21:42   So home, and after some merry discourse in the kitchen with my wife and maids as I now-a-days often do, I being well pleased with both my maids, to bed.

1662-06-18 17:00 r Thence to Wright’s, the painter’s: but, Lord! the difference that is between their two works.

1662-06-18 15:54 r I did give the fellow something that showed them us, and promised to come some other time, and he would show me Lady Castlemaine’s, which I could not then see, it being locked up!

1662-06-18 15:48   Mr. Pett and I walked to Lilly’s, the painter’s, where we saw among other rare things, the Duchess of York, her whole body, sitting instate in a chair, in white sattin, and another of the King, that is not finished; most rare things.

1662-06-18 14:08   I to my Lord Crew’s and dined with him; where I hear the courage of Sir H. Vane at his death is talked on every where as a miracle.


1662-06-17 20:30   Home and to bed betimes by daylight.

1662-06-17 14:49   To the office, and at Sir W. Batten’s, where we all met by chance and talked, and they drank wine; but I forebore all their healths. Sir John Minnes, I perceive, is most excellent company.


1662-06-16 17:28   With my wife to the Wardrobe, and dined there; and in the afternoon with all the children by water to Greenwich, where I showed them the King’s yacht, the house, and the park, all very pleasant; and so to the tavern, and had the musique of the house, and so merrily home again.

1662-06-16 07:49 r I also, with Mr. Davis, did view my cozen Joyce’s tallow, and compared it with the Irish tallow we bought lately, and found ours much more white, but as soft as it; now what is the fault, or whether it be or no a fault, I know not.

1662-06-16 06:15 r And so over the water in a scull (which I have not done a great while), and walked finally to Deptford, where I saw in what forwardness the work is for Sir W. Batten’s house and mine, and it is almost ready.

1662-06-16 05:00   After some business took Will forth, and he and I walked over the Tower Hill, but the gate not being open we walked through St. Catharine’s and Ratcliffe (I think it is) by the waterside above a mile before we could get a boat.


1662-06-15 19:48 r She told me that her brother was married and had a wife worth 500l. to him, and did inquire how he might dispose the money to the best advantage, but I forbore to advise her till she could certainly tell me how things are with him, being loth to meddle too soon with him.

1662-06-15 17:03 r Home, and found my wife and Sarah gone to a neighbour church, at which I was not much displeased. By and by she comes again, and, after a word or two, good friends.

1662-06-15 14:38   To church again; but my wife not being dressed as I would have her, I was angry, and she, when she was out of doors in her way to church, returned home again vexed.


1662-06-14 16:08   We had certain news that the Spaniard is before Lisbon with thirteen sail; six Dutch, and the rest his own ships; which will, I fear, be ill for Portugall.

1662-06-14 14:48   I hear my Lord Peterborough is come unexpected from Tangier, to give the King an account of the place, which, we fear, is in none of the best condition.

1662-06-14 12:14 r One asked him why he did not pray for the King. He answered, “Nay,” says he, “you shall see I can pray for the King: I pray God bless him!”

1662-06-14 12:08 r He had a blister, or issue, upon his neck, which he desired them not hurt: he changed not his colour or speech to the last, but died justifying himself and the cause he had stood for; and spoke very confidently of his being presently at the right hand of Christ.

1662-06-14 11:45 r Then he prayed, and so fitted himself, and received the blow; but the scaffold was so crowded that we could not see it done.

1662-06-14 11:28 r He made a long speech, many times interrupted by the Sheriff and others there; and they would have taken his paper out of his hand, but he would not let it go. The trumpets were brought under the scaffold that he might not be heard.

1662-06-14 11:07   Having a room got ready for us, we all went out to the Tower-hill; and there, over against the scaffold, made on purpose this day, saw Sir Henry Vane brought. A very great press of people.


1662-06-13 20:08   My wife and I, and Sarah and the boy, a most pleasant walk to Halfway house, and so home and to bed.

1662-06-13 04:25   Up by 4 o’clock in the morning, and read Cicero’s Second Oration against Catiline, which pleased me exceedingly; and more I discern therein than ever I thought was to be found in him; but I perceive it was my ignorance, and that he is as good a writer as ever I read in my life.


1662-06-12 21:55 r But after I was a-bed and asleep, a note came from my brother Tom to tell me that my cozen Anne Pepys, of Worcestershire, her husband is dead, and she married again, and her second husband in town, and intends to come and see me tomorrow.

1662-06-12 21:30   It being the longest day in the year, I made all my people go to bed by daylight.

1662-06-12 15:02   To dinner, by Mr. Gauden’s invitation, to the Dolphin, where a good dinner; but what is to myself a great wonder; that with ease I past the whole dinner without drinking a drop of wine.

1662-06-12 10:04   Among many other businesses, I did get a vote signed by all, concerning my issuing of warrants, which they did not smell the use I intend to make of it; but it is to plead for my clerks to have their right of giving out all warrants, at which I am not a little pleased.

1662-06-12 06:08   I tried on my riding cloth suit with close knees, the first that ever I had; and I think they will be very convenient, if not too hot to wear any other open knees after them.


1662-06-11 19:48   This evening Savill the Paynter came and did varnish over my wife’s picture and mine, and I paid him for my little picture 3l., and so am clear with him.

1662-06-11 15:45 r So that I am vexed with all my heart at Pall for writing to him so much concerning my mother’s illness (which I believe was not so great), so that he should be forced to hasten down on the sudden back into the country without taking leave, or having any pleasure here.

1662-06-11 15:38   I had a letter from my father that he is got down well, and found my mother pretty well again.

1662-06-11 12:18   To the office again all the afternoon, Mr. Hater and I writing over my Alphabet fair, in which I took great pleasure to rule the lines and to have the capitall words wrote with red ink.


1662-06-10 16:58   I went to my bookseller’s, and paid off all for books to this day, and do not intend to buy any more of any kind a good while, though I had a great mind to have bought the King’s works, as they are new printed in folio, and present it to my Lord.

1662-06-10 11:51   At the office all the morning, much business; and great hopes of bringing things, by Mr. Coventry’s means, to a good condition in the office.


1662-06-09 16:07   To Greatorex’s, and with him and another stranger to the Tavern, but I drank no wine. He recommended Bond, of our end of the town, to teach me to measure timber, and some other things that I would learn, in order to my office.

1662-06-09 07:09   Early up and at the office with Mr. Hater, making my alphabet of contracts, upon the dispatch of which I am now very intent, for that I am resolved much to enquire into the price of commodities.


1662-06-08 20:49 r After prayers, I did ask him where he learned that immodest garb, and he answered me that it was not immodest, or some such slight answer, at which I did give him two boxes on the ears, which I never did before, and so was after a little troubled at it.

1662-06-08 20:28   Home, and observe my man Will to walk with his cloak flung over his shoulder, like a Ruffian, which, whether it was that he might not be seen to walk along with the footboy, I know not, but I was vexed at it.

1662-06-08 18:08   Walked to my Lady’s, and there supped with her, and merry, among other things, with the parrott which my Lord hath brought from the sea, which speaks very well, and cries Pall so pleasantly, that made my Lord give it my Lady Paulina; but my Lady, her mother, do not like it.


1662-06-07 21:14   I hear that my father is gone into the country, but whether to Richmond as he intended, and thence to meet us at Hampton Court, I know not, or to Brampton. At which I am much troubled.

1662-06-07 19:03   I perceive, as Sir G. Carteret told me, were it not that Mr. Coventry had already feathered his nest in selling of places, he do like him very well, and hopes great good from him. But he complains so of lack of money, that my heart is very sad.

1662-06-07 17:26   My mind in trouble whether I should go to Hampton Court tomorrow or no. At last resolved the contrary, because of the charge thereof, and I am afraid now to bring in any accounts for journeys, and so will others I suppose be, because of Mr. Coventry’s prying into them.

1662-06-07 13:59   Sir J. Robinson, Lieutenant of the Tower, says that yesterday Sir H. Vane had a full hearing at the King’s Bench, and is found guilty.

1662-06-07 11:26   To the office, where all the morning, and I find Mr. Coventry is resolved to do much good, and to enquire into all the miscarriages of the office.


1662-06-06 15:57   To my brother Tom’s, where we found a letter from Pall that my mother is dangerously ill in fear of death, which troubles my father and me much, but I hope it is otherwise, the letter being four days old since it was writ.

1662-06-06 12:07   To the Wardrobe by appointment to meet my father, who did come and was well treated by my Lady, who tells me she has some thoughts to send her two little boys to our house at Brampton, but I have got leave for them to go along with me and my wife to Hampton Court.

1662-06-06 10:37   At my office all alone all the morning, and the smith being with me about other things, did open a chest that hath stood ever since I came to the office, in my office, and there we found a modell of a fine ship, which I long to know whether it be the King’s or Mr. Turner’s.


1662-06-05 14:28   I was called from dinner by a note from Mr. Moore to Alderman Backwell’s, to see some thousands of my Lord’s crusados weighed, and we find that 3,000 come to about 530l. or 40 generally.

1662-06-05 09:03   To the office, where they were just sat down, and I showed them yesterday’s discovery, and have got Sir R. Ford to be my enemy by it; but I care not, for it is my duty, and so did get his bill stopped for the present.


1662-06-04 15:09   I to my Lord’s, who I find resolved to buy Brampton Manor of Sir Peter Ball, at which I am glad.

1662-06-04 13:30 r After eating some fish that we had bought upon the water at Falconer’s, we went to Woolwich, and there viewed our frames of our houses, and so home.

1662-06-04 10:03 r I was glad of this discovery, because I would not have the King’s workmen discouraged (as Sir W. Batten do most basely do) from representing the faults of merchants’ goods, where there is any.

1662-06-04 09:55 r We found it to be very bad, and broke sooner than, upon a fair triall, five threads of that against four of Riga yarn; and also that some of it had old stuff that had been tarred, covered over with new hemp, which is such a cheat as hath not been heard of.

1662-06-04 09:44   Sir W. Batten and I by water to Woolwich; and there saw an experiment made of Sir R. Ford’s Holland’s yarn (about which we have lately had so much stir; and I have much concerned myself for our ropemaker, Mr. Hughes, who has represented it as bad).


1662-06-03 22:15 r But I made the maids to rise and light a candle, and set it in the dining-room, to scare away thieves, and so to sleep.

1662-06-03 21:56   Home and to bed, my mind troubled about Sir W. Pen, his playing the rogue with me today, as also about the charge of money that is in my house, which I had forgot.

1662-06-03 17:39 r Yesterday (Sir R. Ford told me) the Aldermen of the City did attend her in their habits, and did present her with a gold Cupp and 1000l. in gold therein.

1662-06-03 16:41   To the Wardrobe, where I found my Lady come from Hampton Court, where the Queen hath used her very civilly; and my Lady tells me is a most pretty woman, at which I am glad.

1662-06-03 13:49   I went down to the Towre Wharf, where Mr. Creed and Shepley was ready with three chests of the crusados, being about 6000l., ready to bring to shore to my house, which they did, and put it in my further cellar, and Mr. Shepley took the key.

1662-06-03 10:02 r What Sir J. Minnes will do when he comes I know not, but Sir W. Pen did it like a base raskall, and so I shall remember him while I live.

1662-06-03 09:54 r And what with the letter of the Duke’s orders, and Mr. Barlow’s letter, and the practice of our predecessors, which Sir G. Carteret knew best when he was Comptroller, it was ruled for me.

1662-06-03 09:32   Upon our making a contract, I went, as I use to do, to draw the heads thereof, but Sir W. Pen most basely told me that the Comptroller is to do it, and so begun to employ Mr. Turner about it, at which I was much vexed, and begun to dispute.

1662-06-03 04:41   Up by four o’clock and to my business in my chamber, to even accounts with my Lord and myself, and very fain I would become master of 1000l., but I have not above 530l. toward it yet.


1662-06-02 20:12   This day my wife put on her slasht wastecoate, which is very pretty.

1662-06-02 14:49 r We found her in a dishabille, intending to go to Hampton Court tomorrow. We had much pretty discourse, and a very fine lady she is.

1662-06-02 14:33   My father to dinner with me, and then by coach, setting him down in Cheapside, my wife and I to Mrs. Clarke’s at Westminster, the first visit that ever we both made her yet.

1662-06-02 08:28   Up early about business and then to the Wardrobe with Mr. Moore, and spoke to my Lord about the exchange of the crusados into sterling money, and other matters.


1662-06-01 15:22   To church, where a Presbyter made a sad and long sermon, which vexed me.
