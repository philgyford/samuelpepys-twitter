1662-10-31 21:52   Great plots are talked to be discovered, and all the prisons in town full of ordinary people, taken from their meeting-places last Sunday.

1662-10-31 21:43   Public matters are full of discontent, what with the sale of Dunkirk, and my Lady Castlemaine, and her faction at Court.

1662-10-31 21:10   In all other things as happy a man as any in the world, for the whole world seems to smile upon me.

1662-10-31 21:07   My head troubled with much business. Then my law businesses for Brampton makes me mad almost.

1662-10-31 09:40   Up and among my workmen, the carpenters being this day laying of my floor of my dining room, with whom I staid a good while.

1662-10-30 20:27   Up to the Deputy Governor; and he do undertake to keep the key of the cellars, that none shall go down without his privity.

1662-10-30 19:48   We set to digging, but could find nothing. But our guides did not at all seem discouraged; they being confident that the money is there.

1662-10-30 15:50   We went into several little cellars; but none did answer so well to the marks which was given him to find it by, as one arched vault.

1662-10-30 15:09   To the Tower. Sir H. Bennet and my Lord Mayor did give us power to fall to work. Our guide demands a candle and into the cellars he goes.

1662-10-30 07:51   Mr. Wade hath discovered 7,000l. hid in the Tower; he was to have two for discovery; my Lord two, and the King three, when it was found.

1662-10-29 19:44   Sir G. Carteret do say that he do not think that there hath been any great plotting among the late people that are clapped up.

1662-10-29 15:20   I received a letter from my father speaking trouble about my uncle Thomas, and of proceeding to lay claim to Brampton and all my uncle left.

1662-10-28 21:20   My house is now in its last dirt, I hope, the plasterer and painter now being upon winding up all my trouble.

1662-10-28 15:09   Home to dinner with my wife, and after dinner she and I passing an hour or two in ridiculous talk, and then to my office.

1662-10-27 18:28   Mr. Mills could get nothing out of the maid (that did poyson herself) before she died, but that she did not like herself, which is strange.

1662-10-27 15:07   To the Exchange, and took many turns, observing one pretty Exchange lass, with her face full of black patches, which was a strange sight.

1662-10-27 14:21   Mr. Creed told me what is whispered, that young Crofts is lawful son to the King, the King being married to his mother.

1662-10-27 09:41   It seems Mr. Spong is so far thought guilty as that they intend to pitch upon him to put to the wracke or some other torture.

1662-10-26 21:55   Home and to bed with quiett mind, blessed be God, but afeard of my candle’s going out, which makes me write thus slubberingly.

1662-10-26 21:11   I find myself, by my expense in bands and clothes this month, abated a little of my last, and I am worth 679l.; for which God be praised.

1662-10-26 18:32   All this day soldiers going up and down the town, there being an alarm and many Quakers and others clapped up; I believe without any reason.

1662-10-26 13:38   Home and dined, and Mr. Sympson, my joyner that do my diningroom, and my brother Tom with me to a delicate fat pig.

1662-10-25 16:52   All the afternoon alone at my office and among my workmen, who (I mean the joyners) have even ended my dining room.

1662-10-24 13:29   Dined with my wife upon a most excellent dish of tripes of my own directing, covered with mustard, of which I made a very great meal.

1662-10-24 10:50   I find no objection but their ignorance and unwillingness to do anything of pains and what is out of their ordinary dull road.

1662-10-24 10:49   I walked to Deptford to discourse with Mr. Lowly and Davis about my conceptions about keeping books of the distinct works done in the yards.

1662-10-24 08:27   With great pleasure lying a great while talking and sporting in bed with my wife (for we have been for some years now, a very happy couple).

1662-10-23 16:33   Sir W. Pen continues in great pain of the gout and in bed, cannot stir hand nor foot but with great pain.

1662-10-23 11:48   We stept all out to visit Sir W. Batten, who it seems has not been well all yesterday, but being let blood is now pretty well.

1662-10-22 18:23   Betterton is not married to Ianthe, as they say; he is a sober, serious man, studious and humble, and is rich with what he gets and saves.

1662-10-22 08:52   I to my Lord Sandwich’s, who receives me more and more kindly, now he sees that I am respected in the world; and is my most noble patron.

1662-10-21 15:07   It is 30l. damage to me for my joining in committing Field to prison, we being not justices of the Peace in the City, though in Middlesex.

1662-10-21 10:42   It is my great folly to be so much troubled at these trifles; I forget the lesson I use to preach to others of τὰ ἐφ ἡμιν χγ τὰ γχ ἐφ ἡμῖν.

1662-10-21 10:40   I was vexed, and am to the very heart for it, for fear it should put Sir J. Minnes upon taking the closett and my chamber from me.

1662-10-21 10:38   My workmen setting about the putting up of my rails upon my leads, Sir J. Minnes did spy them and fell a-swearing.

1662-10-20 17:18   To the Duke’s house: but whether it was in over-expecting or what, I know not, but I was never less pleased with a play in my life.

1662-10-20 11:26   I saw the so much desired by me picture of my Lady Castlemaine, which is a most blessed picture; and that that I must have a copy of.

1662-10-20 09:02   Killigrew did so commend “The Villaine,” a new play made by Tom Porter; as if there never had been any such play come upon the stage.

1662-10-19 20:16   I am sorry to hear that the news of the selling of Dunkirk is taken so generally ill, as I find it is among the merchants.

1662-10-19 16:31   I with Mr Townsend walked in the garden, advising with him about Tom’s business. He says I offer fair to give her 30l. joynture and no more.

1662-10-19 15:07   Mr. Moore recovers well; his doctor coming to him, one Dr. Merrit, we had some of his discourse of anatomy, and other things, very pleasant.

1662-10-19 07:20   I put on my first new laceband; and so neat it is, that I am resolved my great expense shall be lacebands.

1662-10-18 16:13   I intent upon my workmen, especially my joyners, who will make my dining room very pretty.

1662-10-18 09:48   Having resolved of my brother’s entertaining his mistress’s mother to-morrow I sent my wife thither to lie there to-night and to direct him.

1662-10-17 11:04   Mrs Haslerigge, the great beauty, is got with child, and now brought to bed, and lays it to the King or the Duke of York.

1662-10-17 10:44   With Mr. Creed to Westminster Hall, and thither comes Captn. Ferrers. We to Creed’s chamber, and there sat a good while and drank chocolate.

1662-10-17 09:50   To my Lord Sandwich, and told him how well things do go in the country, of which he was very glad, and seems to concern himself much for me.

1662-10-17 08:33   Tom comes to me, and I advise him how to deal with his mistress’s mother about his giving her a joynture.

1662-10-16 20:30   The King gives them half-pay, more than is used in such cases. They never used to have any thing, and yet the men were most discontented.

1662-10-16 20:28   To the Treasury office, where Sir John and I did stay late paying money to the men that are saved out of the Satisfaction that was lost.

1662-10-16 06:36   I rose in good temper, finding a good chimneypiece made in my upper dining-room chamber, and the diningroom wainscoat in a good forwardness.

1662-10-15 22:17   Having left our horses at their masters, walked home, found all things well, and with full joy, though very weary.

1662-10-15 18:08   Finding our horses in good case and the night being pretty light, we even made shift to reach London, though both of us very weary.

1662-10-15 08:42   Dr. Fairbrother told us how the room we were in was the room where Cromwell and his associated officers did begin to plot their mischiefs.

1662-10-15 07:56   I went forth and showed Mr. Cooke King’s College Chapel, Trinity College, and St. John’s College Library.

1662-10-14 21:12   And so by moonlight most bravely all the way to Cambridge, with great pleasure, whither we come, and took up at the Bear.

1662-10-14 17:58   I took leave of father, mother, Pall, to whom I have shown no kindness since I come, for I find her so ill-natured that I cannot love her.

1662-10-14 17:49   I did with most compleat joy of mind go from the Court with my father home, and in a quarter of an hour did get on horseback.

1662-10-14 16:09   The steward, as he promised me, did find pretensions kindly and readily to put off their admittance, by which I find they are much defeated.

1662-10-14 10:55   The jury being sworn and the charge given them, they fell to our business, finding the heir-at-law to be my uncle Thomas.

1662-10-14 09:07   I did digest into a method all I could say in our defence, in case there should be occasion, and so to the court at the Lordshipp.

1662-10-13 21:59   Waiting with much impatience and doubt the issue of to-morrow’s Court, I to bed.

1662-10-13 17:08   To see with what mirth they come all home together in pomp with their milk, and sometimes they have musique go before them.

1662-10-13 17:07   With my father took a melancholy walk to Portholme, seeing the country-maids milking their cows there, they being there now at grass.

1662-10-13 08:24   To Huntingdon to the Crown, and there did sit and talk, and eat a breakfast of cold roast beef, and so Sheply to St. Ives Market.

1662-10-13 07:19   To Hinchingbroke, and with Mr. Sheply did look over the house, and I do, I confess, like well of the alteracions, and do like the staircase.

1662-10-12 19:28   Their drink do not please me, till I did send to Goody Stanks for some of her’s which is small and fresh, with a little taste of wormewood.

1662-10-12 11:03   To church, where I saw most of the gentry of the parish; among others, Mrs. Hanbury, a proper lady, and Mr. Bernard and his Lady.

1662-10-12 08:19   Made myself fine with Captain Ferrers’s lace band, being lothe to wear my own new scallop, it is so fine.

1662-10-11 20:17   I rode to Hinchingbroke (Will with me), and there to my Lady’s chamber, but, it being night, and my head full of business, staid not long.

1662-10-11 13:09   To dinner, where there being nothing but a poor breast of mutton, and that ill-dressed, I was much displeased, there being Mr. Cooke there.

1662-10-11 11:58   I walked up and down the house and garden, and find my father’s alteracions very handsome.

1662-10-11 11:22   I rode to Huntingdon, and so to Brampton; where I found my father and two brothers, and Mr. Cooke, my mother and sister.

1662-10-11 06:44   Up betimes, and a little breakfast, a poor one, like our supper, such as I cannot feed on, because of my she-cozen Claxton’s gouty hands.

1662-10-10 17:08   Roger Pepys has gone out of town to keep a Court; I was forced to go to Impington to take such advice as my uncle and his son could give me.

1662-10-10 15:00   This day there is a Congregation for the choice of officers in the University. Dr. Fairbrother after dinner carries me to the Schooles.

1662-10-10 14:21   In Cambridge I to my cozen Angier’s house; and there found Dr. Fairbrother, with a barrel of good oysters, a couple of lobsters, and wine.

1662-10-10 08:38   My feet so swelled with pain that I could not get on my boots, which vexed me to the blood. I was forced to pay 4s. for a pair of old shoes.

1662-10-09 21:55   I to bed, very well, but my feet being much cramped by my new hard boots that I bought the other day of Wotton were in much pain.

1662-10-09 21:08   A gentleman tells me, that it is believed the Queen is with child, for that the coaches are ordered to ride very easily through the streets.

1662-10-09 20:19   We got to Ware before night; and resolved to ride to Puckeridge, which we did, though the way was bad, by help of company riding before us.

1662-10-09 13:28   I got on horseback at our back gate, with my man Will with me, both well-mounted on two grey horses.

1662-10-09 12:33   I should have dined at Sir W. Pen’s at a venison pasty with the rest of our fellows, but I could not get time, but sent for a bit home.

1662-10-08 20:56   I do find myself much bound to go handsome, which I shall do in linen, and so the other things may be all the plainer.

1662-10-08 20:49   I brought my scallop home, a very neat one. It cost me about 3l, and 3l. more I have given Captain Ferrers to buy me another.

1662-10-08 19:28   To my Lord’s, but he is at White Hall with the King, before whom the puppet plays I saw this summer in Covent-garden are acted this night.

1662-10-08 09:42   It is the greatest comfort and encouragement that ever I had in my life, and do owe it all to Mr. Coventry’s goodness and ingenuity.

1662-10-08 09:40   The Duke of York did yesterday of his own accord tell my Lord that he did thank him for one person brought into the Navy, naming myself.

1662-10-07 13:49   At the office all the morning, dined at home with my wife.

1662-10-06 20:22   I hear that Mr. Moore is gone very sick to the Wardrobe this afternoon, which troubles me much both for his own sake and for mine.

1662-10-06 09:01   Upon enquiry into the miscarriages of the Duke’s family, Mr. Biggs, his steward, is found very faulty, and is turned out of his employment.

1662-10-05 14:29   To talk with my wife, chiefly about her learning to dance against her going next year into the country, which I am willing she shall do.

1662-10-05 10:08   This day the parson has got one to read with a surplice on. I suppose himself will take it up hereafter, for a cunning fellow he is.

1662-10-05 07:04   We fell out about my maid Sarah, whom my wife would fain put away, when I think her as good a servant as ever came into a house.

1662-10-04 20:21   Examining the particulars of the miscarriage of the Satisfaction, sunk on the Dutch coast through the negligence of the pilott.

1662-10-03 22:15   Doing business till bedtime, it being my manner to spend too much of my daytime with my wife and the workmen and do business at night.

1662-10-03 21:43   Dekins, the merchant, is dead this afternoon, for grief that his daughter, my Morena, who has long been ill, is given over by the Doctors.

1662-10-03 13:07   Dined with my wife upon herrings, the first I have eat this year, and so to my workmen again.

1662-10-02 16:49   Here we saw “The Cardinall,” a tragedy I had never seen before, nor is there any great matter in it.

1662-10-02 15:22   I could not see the King or Queene, but many of the fine ladies, who yet are really not so handsome generally as I used to take them to be.

1662-10-02 15:04   I did follow five gentlemen who were carried to a private door in a wall, and crept through and come into one of the boxes next the King’s.

1662-10-02 14:32   Hearing that there was a play at the Cockpit (and my Lord Sandwich, who came to town last night, at it), I do go thither.

1662-10-01 21:58   Home and with my wife to bed, the first time I have lain there these two months and more, which I am now glad to do again.

1662-10-01 05:55   Up with my mind pretty well at rest about my accounts and other business.
