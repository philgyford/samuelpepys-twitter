1662-08-31 19:43   Some Presbyters were clapped up today, and strict watch is kept in the City by the train-bands, and letters of a plot are taken. God preserve us! for all these things bode very ill.

1662-08-31 15:32   To church, and there heard a simple sermon upon David’s words, “Blessed is the man that walketh not in the way of the ungodly,” &c., and the best of his sermon was the degrees of walking, standing, and sitting, showing how by steps and degrees sinners do grow in wickedness.

1662-08-31 14:19 r My wife is still in the country; my house all in dirt; but my work in a good forwardness, and will be much to my mind at last.

1662-08-31 14:07   So to my office, and there made my monthly accounts, and find myself worth in money about 686l. 19s. 2½d., for which God be praised.

1662-08-31 13:40   News is brought me that Sir W. Pen is come. But I would take no notice thereof till after dinner, and then sent him word that I would wait on him, but he is gone to bed.

1662-08-31 07:16   Waked early, but being in a strange house, did not rise till 7 o’clock almost, and so rose and read over my oaths, and whiled away an hour thinking upon businesses.


1662-08-30 22:25 r Expecting Sir W. Pen’s coming, but he not coming to-night I went thither and there lay very well, and like my lodging well enough. My man Will after he had got me to bed did go home and lay there, and my maid Jane lay among my goods at Sir W. Pen’s.

1662-08-30 12:12 r And so got Griffin to get a lodging as near as he could, which is without a door of our back door upon Tower Hill, a chamber where John Davis, one of our clerks, do lie in, but he do provide himself elsewhere, and I am to have his chamber.

1662-08-30 12:10   Had news that Sir W. Pen would be in town from Ireland, which I much wonder at, he giving so little notice of it, and it troubled me exceedingly what to do for a lodging, and more what to do with my goods, that are all in his house.


1662-08-29 19:56   Among other businesses did begin tonight with Mr. Lewes to look into the nature of a purser’s account, and the business of victualling, in which there is great variety; but I find I shall understand it, and be able to do service there also.

1662-08-29 14:07   Dinner alone at home, and so to my workmen again, finding my presence to carry on the work both to my mind and with more haste, and I thank God I am pleased with it.


1662-08-28 07:31   So I rose and among my workmen, in my gown, without a doublet, an hour or two or more, till I was afraid of getting an ague.

1662-08-28 05:58 r I observe that Will, whom I used to call two or three times in a morning, would now wake of himself and rise without calling. Which though angry I was glad to see.


1662-08-27 23:58 r Whereupon I struck him, and did stay up chiding him for it, and did in plain terms tell him that I would not be served so, and that I am resolved to look out some boy that I may have the bringing up of after my own mind, and which I do intend to do.

1662-08-27 23:44 r But when I came home I found him there at his ease in his study, which vexed me cruelly, that he should no more mind me, but to let me be all alone at the office waiting for him.

1662-08-27 23:42   I went into my house, Will having been making up books at Deptford with other clerks all day, I did not think he was come home, but was in fear for him, it being very late, what was become of him.

1662-08-27 17:34   Today my hogshead of sherry I have sold to Sir W. Batten, and am glad of my money instead of wine.


1662-08-26 23:21   So to bed.

1662-08-26 22:43 r We went to the payhouse, and there staid till 10 o’clock at night paying off the Martin and Kinsale, being small but troublesome ships to pay, and so in the dark by water home to the Custom House, and so got a lanthorn to light us home.

1662-08-26 14:30 r He and I by water to Deptford, and there found Sir G. Carteret and my Lady at dinner, and so we sat down and eat another dinner of venison with them.

1662-08-26 12:49   Dined alone with Sir W. Batten, which I have not done a great while, but his lady being out of the way I was the willinger to do it.

1662-08-26 05:21   Up betimes and among my works and workmen, and with great pleasure seeing them go on merrily, and a good many hands, which I perceive makes good riddance.


1662-08-25 21:33   I went home, and up among my workmen, and found they had done a good day’s work, and so to my office till late ordering of several businesses, and so home and to bed, my mind, God be praised, full of business, but great quiet.

1662-08-25 09:48 r Calling in my way in Hamcreek, where I have never been before, and there found two of the King’s ships lie there without any living creature aboard, which troubled me, every thing being stole away that can be.

1662-08-25 09:42   By water to Woolwich where I staid seeing a cable of 14 inches laid, in which there was good variety.



1662-08-24 20:48   There hath been a disturbance in a church in Friday Street; a great many young people knotting together and crying out “Porridge” often and seditiously in the church, and took the Common Prayer Book away; and did tear it; but it is a thing which appears to me very ominous.

1662-08-24 18:44 r I walked to my uncle Wight’s, the truth is, in hopes to have seen and been acquainted with the pretty lady that came along with them to dinner the other day to Mr. Rawlinson, but she is gone away.

1662-08-24 14:05 r So home to dinner, where my brother Tom came to me, and both before and after dinner he and I walked all alone in the garden, talking about his late journey and his mistress, and for what he tells me it is like to do well.

1662-08-24 08:54 r Found Will Griffin and Thomas Hewett got into the pew next to our backs, where our maids sit, but when I come, they went out; so forward some people are to outrun themselves.

1662-08-24 08:46   So rose and to my office till church time, writing down my yesterday’s observations, and so to church, where I all alone.

1662-08-24 07:07   Slept till 7 o’clock, which I have not done a very great while, but it was my weariness last night that caused it.


1662-08-23 21:10   With much ado, the streets being crammed with people going home to the city, for all the borders of the river had been full of people, as the King had come, to a miracle got to the Palace Yard, and there took boat, and so to the Old Swan, and so walked home.

1662-08-23 18:35   I went in to my Lord, and he and I had half an hour’s private discourse about the discontents of the times, which we concluded would not come to anything of difference, though the Presbyters would be glad enough of it; but we do not think religion will so soon cause another war.

1662-08-23 16:40 r There happened a scaffold below to fall, and we feared some hurt, but there was none, but she of all the great ladies only run down among the common rabble to see what hurt was done, and did take care of a child that received some little hurt, which methought was so noble.

1662-08-23 16:21 r But that which pleased me best was, that my Lady Castlemaine stood over against us upon a piece of White Hall, where I glutted myself with looking on her.

1662-08-23 15:55 r Anon come the King and Queen in a barge under a canopy with 10,000 barges and boats, I think, for we could see no water for them, nor discern the King nor Queen.

1662-08-23 15:40 r And all the show consisted chiefly in the number of boats and barges; and two pageants, one of a King, and another of a Queen, with her Maydes of Honour sitting at her feet very prettily; and they tell me the Queen is Sir. Richard Ford’s daughter.

1662-08-23 15:15 r So we fairly walked it to White Hall, and through my Lord’s lodgings we got into White Hall garden, and so to the Bowling-green, and up to the top of the new Banqueting House there, over the Thames, which was a most pleasant place as any I could have got.

1662-08-23 14:25   I offered eight shillings for a boat to attend me this afternoon, and they would not, it being the day of the Queen’s coming to town from Hampton Court.

1662-08-23 12:22   Mr. Coventry and I did walk together a great while in the Garden, where he did tell me his mind about Sir G. Carteret’s having so much the command of the money, which must be removed. And indeed it is the bane of all our business.


1662-08-22 17:15   Mr. Creed did give me a little banquet, and I had liked to have begged a parrot for my wife, but he hath put me in a way to get a better from Steventon; at Portsmouth.  But I did get of him a draught of Tangier to take a copy by, which pleases me very well.

1662-08-22 16:22   By water to Westminster Hall, and there I hear that old Mr. Hales did lately die suddenly in an hour’s time. Here I met with Will Bowyer, and had a promise from him of a place to stand tomorrow at his house to see the show.

1662-08-22 13:40   I took boat home again and dined, and after dinner sent for some of my workmen and did scold at them so as I hope my work will be hastened.

1662-08-22 10:28 r In the great storehouse, while Captain Badily was talking to us, one from a trap-door above let fall unawares a coyle of cable, that it was 10,000 to one it had not broke Captain Badily’s neck, it came so near him, but did him no hurt.

1662-08-22 10:07   About five o’clock rose, and up to my office, and about 8 o’clock went down to Deptford, and there with Mr. Davis did look over most of his stores.

1662-08-22 03:52 r The catt was lockt in the chamber, and kept a great mewing, and leapt upon the bed, which made me I could not sleep a great while.

1662-08-22 03:07   I waked with the noise of the rayne, having never in my life heard a more violent shower.


1662-08-21 22:15 r But though I drank no wine today, yet how easily was I of my own accord stirred up to desire my aunt and this pretty lady (for it was for her that I did it) to carry them to Greenwich and see the pleasure boats. But my aunt would not go, of which since I am much glad.

1662-08-21 12:30   I chose to go to Mr. Rawlinson’s, where my uncle Wight and my aunt, and some neighbour couples were at a very good venison pasty. Hither came, after we were set down, a most pretty young lady (only her hands were not white nor handsome), which pleased me well.


1662-08-20 13:45 r I do find my nature ready to run back to my old course of drinking wine and staying from my business, and yet, thank God, I was not fully contented with it, but did stay at little ease.

1662-08-20 13:21 r We had a venison pasty, and other good plain and handsome dishes; the mistress of the house a pretty, well-carriaged woman, and a fine hand she hath; and her maid a pretty brown lass.

1662-08-20 13:11   I went to Westminster Hall with Mr. Moore, and there meeting Mr. Townsend, he would needs take me to Fleet Street, to one Mr. Barwell, squire sadler to the King, and there we and several other Wardrobe-men dined.

1662-08-20 08:04 r On all hands, by God’s blessing, I find myself a very rising man.

1662-08-20 07:41 r Comes in Mr. Coventry to us, whom my Lord tells that he is also put into the commission, and that I am there, of which he said he was glad; and did tell my Lord that I was indeed the life of this office, and much more to my commendation beyond measure.

1662-08-20 06:55   To my Lord Sandwich, whom I found in bed, and he sent for me in. Among other talk, he do tell me that he hath put me into commission with a great many great persons in the business of Tangier, which is a very great honour to me, and may be of good concernment to me.


1662-08-19 07:41   Mr. Creed tells me that my Lord has put me into Commission with himself and many noblemen and others for Tangier, which, if it be, is not only great honour, but may be of profit too, and I am very glad of it.


1662-08-18 17:15 r I find Deane a pretty able man, and able to do the King service; but, I think, more out of envy to the rest of the officers of the yard, of whom he complains much, than true love, more than others, to the service.

1662-08-18 16:59 r By and by I got a horseback again and rode to Barking, and there saw the place where they ship this timber for Woolwich; and so Deane and I home again, and parted at Bowe, and I home just before a great showre of rayne, as God would have it.

1662-08-18 12:40 r After we had been a good while in the wood, we rode to Illford, and there, while dinner was getting ready, he and I practised measuring of the tables and other things till I did understand measuring of timber and board very well.

1662-08-18 10:22 r He and I rid into Waltham Forest, and there we saw many trees of the King’s a-hewing; and he showed me the whole mystery of off square,1 wherein the King is abused in the timber that he buys, which I shall with much pleasure be able to correct.

1662-08-18 09:00   Took horse and rode to Bowe, and there staid at the King’s Head, and eat a breakfast of eggs till Mr. Deane of Woolwich came to me.


1662-08-17 21:15 r I hear most of the Presbyters took their leaves to-day, and that the City is much dissatisfied with it. I pray God keep peace among us, and make the Bishops careful of bringing in good men in their rooms, or else all will fly a-pieces.

1662-08-17 14:29 r Parson Herring says, “This is just the case of England at present. God he bids us to preach, and men bid us not to preach; and if we do, we are to be imprisoned and further punished. … I beg your prayers, and the prayers of all good Christians, for us.”

1662-08-17 14:20 r After dinner to St. Dunstan’s again; and the church quite crowded before I came, which was just at one o’clock; but I got into the gallery again, but stood in a crowd and did exceedingly sweat all the time.

1662-08-17 12:07 r So to Madam Turner’s, and dined with her. She had heard Parson Herring take his leave; tho’ he, by reading so much of the Common Prayer as he did, hath cast himself out of the good opinion of both sides.

1662-08-17 09:22 r His text was, “Now the God of Peace—;” the last Hebrews, and the 20th verse: he making a very good sermon, and very little reflections in it to any thing of the times.

1662-08-17 08:03 r I went, and crowded in at a back door among others, the church being half-full almost before any doors were open publicly; which is the first time that I have done so these many years since I used to go with my father and mother.

1662-08-17 07:59 r And so I went and walked an hour in the Temple-garden, reading my vows, which it is a great content to me to see how I am a changed man in all respects for the better, since I took them, which the God of Heaven continue to me, and make me thankful for.

1662-08-17 06:54 r Walked to St. Dunstan’s, where, it not being seven o’clock yet, the doors were not open.

1662-08-17 03:58   Up very early, this being the last Sunday that the Presbyterians are to preach, unless they read the new Common Prayer and renounce the Covenant, and so I had a mind to hear Dr. Bates’s farewell sermon.


1662-08-16 04:51   Looking over my work, what they did yesterday; and am pretty well pleased, but I find it will be long before they have done, though the house is cover-d and I free from the weather.


1662-08-15 19:01   I went to Paul’s Church Yard to my bookseller’s; and there I hear that next Sunday will be the last of a great many Presbyterian ministers in town, who, I hear, will give up all. I pray God the issue may be good, for the discontent is great.

1662-08-15 14:20 r After dinner comes in a jugler, which showed us very pretty tricks.

1662-08-15 13:44   So to the Swan, where Mr. Brigden and his father-in-law, Blackbury, of whom we had bought timber in the office, but have not dealt well with us, did make me a fine dinner only to myself. I seemed very pleasant, but am no friend to the man’s dealings with us in the office.

1662-08-15 12:32   To the Change, and there hear of some Quakers that are seized on, that would have blown up the prison in Southwark where they are put.

1662-08-15 04:12   Up very early, and up about seeing how my work proceeds, and am pretty well pleased therewith; especially my wife’s closet will be very pretty.


1662-08-14 13:38 r Most of which was concerning the Forest of Dean, and the timber there, and iron-workes with their great antiquity, and the vast heaps of cinders which they find, and are now of great value, being necessary for the making of iron at this day; and without which they cannot work.

1662-08-14 13:08   Commissioner Pett and I being invited, went by Sir John Winter’s coach sent for us, to the Mitre, in Fenchurch street, to a venison-pasty; where I found him a very worthy man; and good discourse.

1662-08-14 04:27   Up early and to look on my works, and find my house to go on apace.


1662-08-13 15:08 r To Lambeth; and there saw the little pleasure-boat in building by the King, my Lord Brunkard, and the virtuosoes of the town, according to new lines, which Mr. Pett cries up mightily, but how it will prove we shall soon see.

1662-08-13 13:40   Commr. Pett and I by water to Greenwich, and on board the pleasure-boats to see what they wanted, they being ordered to sea, and very pretty things I still find them.

1662-08-13 08:49 r I do find it the greatest cheat that I have yet found; they having eightpence per yard allowed them by pretence of a contract, where no such thing appears; and it is threepence more than was formerly paid, and than I now offer the Board to have them done.

1662-08-13 07:52   Up early, and to my office, where people come to me about business, and by and by we met on purpose to enquire into the business of the flag-makers, where I am the person that do chiefly manage the business against them on the King’s part.


1662-08-12 08:50 r Among others Mr. Deane, the Assistant of Woolwich, who I find will discover to me the whole abuse that his Majesty suffers in the measuring of timber, of which I shall be glad. He promises me also a modell of a ship, which will please me exceedingly, for I do want one of my own.

1662-08-12 08:44   Up early at my office, and I find all people beginning to come to me.


1662-08-11 21:52   So to my business till 9 at night, and so to supper and to bed, my mind a little at ease because my house is now quite tiled.

1662-08-11 18:07   I to the office again, whither Cooper came and read his last lecture to me upon my modell, and so bid me good bye, he being to go to-morrow to Chatham to take charge of the ship I have got him.

1662-08-11 15:29   Dean Fuller tells me that his niece, that sings so well, whom I have long longed to see, is married to one Mr. Boys, a wholesale man at the Three Crowns in Cheapside.


1662-08-10 12:50 r He told me the new service-book (which is now lately come forth) was laid upon their deske at St. Sepulchre’s for Mr. Gouge to read; but he laid it aside, and would not meddle with it: and I perceive the Presbyters do all prepare to give over all against Bartholomew-tide.

1662-08-10 12:45   Hither came my uncle Fenner, and spoke to me about Pegg Kite’s business of her portion, which her husband demands, but I will have nothing to do with it. I believe he has no mind to part with the money out of his hands, but let him do what he will with it.

1662-08-10 12:20   So to Tom’s, where Dr. Fairebrother, newly come from Cambridge, met me, and Dr. Thomas Pepys. I framed myself as pleasant as I could, but my mind was another way.

1662-08-10 11:04   I walked to St. Dunstan’s, the church being now finished; and here I heard Dr. Bates, who made a most eloquent sermon; and I am sorry I have hitherto had so low an opinion of the man, for I have not heard a neater sermon a great while, and more to my content.


1662-08-09 20:42   Writing a letter to my brother John to dissuade him from being Moderator of his year, which I hear is proffered him, of which I am very glad.

1662-08-09 13:57   By Mr. Coventry’s coach towards White Hall; but there being a stop at the Savoy, we ’light and took water, all the way having good discourse, and in short I find him the most ingenuous person I ever found in my life, and am happy in his acquaintance and my interest in him.

1662-08-09 10:57   To my office, whither by and by comes Cooper, to whom I told my getting for him the Reserve, for which he was very thankful, and fell to work upon our modell, and did a good morning’s work upon the rigging, and am very sorry that I must lose him so soon.


1662-08-08 18:09 r To Deptford, and there surprised the Yard, and called them to a muster, and discovered many abuses, which we shall be able to understand hereafter and amend.

1662-08-08 16:52 r Another rule is a proverb that he hath been taught, that cannot say no (that is, that is of so good a nature that he cannot deny any thing, or cross another in doing any thing), is not fit for business. Which is a very great fault of mine, which I must amend in.

1662-08-08 16:41 r Thence we walked talking, very good discourse all the way to Greenwich, and I do find most excellent discourse from him. Among other things, his rule of suspecting every man that proposes any thing to him to be a knave; or, at least, to have some ends of his own in it.

1662-08-08 14:48   Dined with Mr. Falconer, and after dinner to several experiments of Hemp, and particularly some Milan hemp that is brought over ready dressed.

1662-08-08 12:30   By water to Woolwich, there to see the manner of tarring, and all the morning looking to see the several proceedings in making of cordage, and other things relating to that sort of works, much to my satisfaction.


1662-08-07 22:14   It being become a pleasure to me now-a-days to follow my business, and the greatest part may be imputed to my drinking no wine, and going to no plays.

1662-08-07 11:58   Up by four o’clock and to my office, and by and by Mr. Cooper comes and to our modell, which pleases me more and more. At this till 8 o’clock, and so we sat in the office and staid all the morning, my interest still growing, for which God be praised.


1662-08-06 21:35   Writing in my study a mouse ran over my table, which I shut up fast under my shelf’s upon my table till tomorrow, and so home and to bed.

1662-08-06 16:33   Upon the whole I see Sir W. Batten perceives himself tottering, and that he is suspected, and would be kind to me, but I do my business in the office and neglect him.

1662-08-06 12:49   Dined at home, and can hardly keep myself from having a mind to my wench, but I hope I shall not fall to such a shame to myself.

1662-08-06 10:00 r And the world says Mr. Montagu did carry himself very poorly in the business, and hath lost his honour for ever with all people in it, of which I am very glad, in hopes that it will humble him.

1662-08-06 09:58 r He proved too hard for Montagu, and drove him so far backward that he fell into a ditch, and dropt his sword, but with honour would take no advantage over him; but did give him his life.

1662-08-06 09:56   I met with Mr. Pierce, the chyrurgeon, who told me how Mr. Edward Montagu hath lately had a duell with Mr. Cholmely, that is first gentleman-usher to the Queen, and was a messenger from the King to her in Portugall, and is a fine gentleman.

1662-08-06 05:26   Going to my office, met Sir G. Carteret in coming through the yard, and so walked a good while talking with him about Sir W. Batten, and find that he is going down the wind in every body’s esteem.


1662-08-05 21:58   To the office again all the afternoon, till it was so dark that I could not see hardly what it is that I now set down when I write this word, and so went to my chamber and to bed, being sleepy.

1662-08-05 12:52   Dined alone at home, and was glad my house is begun tiling.

1662-08-05 03:13 r At last waked one man; but it was a merchant ship, the Royall Catharine: so to the Towerdock and home, where the girl sat up for me. It was about three o’clock, and putting Mr. Boddam out of my bed, went to bed.

1662-08-05 01:20 r And so got right again with much ado, after two or three circles and so on, and at Greenwich set in Captain Cocke, and I set forward, hailing to all the King’s ships at Deptford, but could not wake any man: so that we could have done what we would with their ships.


1662-08-04 23:58 r Above Woolwich we lost our way, and went back to Blackwall, and up and down, being guided by nothing but the barking of a dog, which we had observed in passing by Blackwall.

1662-08-04 23:36 r But I in such fear that I could not sleep till we came to Erith, and there it begun to be calm, and the stars to shine, and so I began to take heart again, and the rest too, and so made shift to slumber a little.

1662-08-04 22:47 r It being very dark, and the wind rising, and our waterman unacquainted with this part of the river, so that we presently cast upon the Essex shore, but got off again, and so, as well as we could, went on.

1662-08-04 22:10 r So took barge at the dock and to Rochester, and there Captain Cocke and I and our two men took coach about 8 at night and to Gravesend, where it was very dark before we got thither to the Swan.

1662-08-04 16:55 r At two o’clock to dinner to the Hill-house, and after dinner dispatched many people’s business. Then to a trial of several sorts of hemp, but could not perform it here so well as at Woolwich, but we did do it pretty well.

1662-08-04 13:45 r So to all the storehouses and viewed the stores of all sorts and the hemp, where we found Captain Cocke’s (which he came down to see along with me) very bad, and some others.

1662-08-04 11:38 r So to the yard, and there mustered the whole ordinary, where great disorder by multitude of servants and old decrepid men, which must be remedied.

1662-08-04 09:53 r Thence to Upnor Castle, and there went up to the top, where there is a fine prospect, but of very small force.

1662-08-04 06:55 r Thence to the Charles, and were troubled to see her kept so neglectedly by the boatswain Clements, who I always took for a very good officer; it is a very brave ship.

1662-08-04 05:15   Walked to the Dock, where Commissioner Pett and I took barge and went to the guardships and mustered them, finding them but badly manned; thence to the Sovereign, which we found kept in good order and very clean, which pleased us well, but few of the officers on board.


1662-08-03 21:49 r This day among other stories he told me how despicable a thing it is to be a hangman in Poland, although it be a place of credit.

1662-08-03 18:38 r And so to his house, and had a syllabub, and saw his closet, which come short of what I expected, but there was fine modells of ships in it indeed, whose worth I could not judge of.

1662-08-03 17:05 r So to church again, where quite weary, and so after sermon walked with him to the yard up and down and the fields, and saw the place designed for the wet dock.

1662-08-03 13:21 r The Commissioner staid at dinner with me, and we had a good dinner, better than I would have had, but I saw there was no helping of it.

1662-08-03 11:08 r A full church, and some pretty women in it; among others, Beck Allen, who was a bride-maid to a new married couple that came to church today, and, which was pretty strange, sat in a pew hung with mourning for a mother of the bride’s, which methinks should have been taken down.

1662-08-03 08:10   Commissioner Pett come to us, and took us to his house, and did give us a fine breakfast of bread and butter, and sweetmeats and other things with great choice, and strong drinks, with which I could not avoyde making my head ake, though I drank but little.


1662-08-02 23:50 r So after a glass of wine, we to our barge, that was ready for me, to the Hill-house, where we soon went to bed, before we slept I telling upon discourse Captain Cocke the manner of my being cut of the stone, which pleased him much.

1662-08-02 22:37 r But at the Swan, finding Mr. Hemson and Lieutenant Carteret of the Foresight come to meet me, I borrowed Mr. Hemson’s horse, and he took another, and so we rode to Rochester in the dark, and there at the Crown Mr. Gregory, Barrow, and others staid to meet me.

1662-08-02 21:11   We to boat, and had a pleasant passage down to Gravesend, but it was nine o’clock before we got thither, so that we were in great doubt what to do, whether to stay there or no; and the rather because I was afeard to ride, because of my pain in my cods.

1662-08-02 13:25 r We had a plain, good dinner, and I see they do live very frugally. I eat among other fruit much mulberrys, a thing I have not eat of these many years, since I used to be at Ashted, at my cozen Pepys’s.

1662-08-02 12:01 r I to Captain Cocke’s along with him to dinner, where I find his lady still pretty, but not so good a humour as I thought she was.

1662-08-02 11:22   I took boat with Will, and down to Greenwich, where Captain Cocke not being at home I was vexed, and went to walk in the Park till he come thither to me.


1662-08-01 22:45   I staid up late, putting things in order for my going to Chatham tomorrow, and so to bed, being in pain in my cods with the little riding in a coach today from the Exchange, which do trouble me.

1662-08-01 19:12 r I had also a mind to my own wench, but I dare not for fear she should prove honest and refuse and then tell my wife.

1662-08-01 19:09   To my chamber, where, God forgive me, I was sorry to hear that Sir W. Pen’s maid Betty was gone away yesterday, for I was in hopes to have had a bout with her before she had gone, she being very pretty.

1662-08-01 12:37   To the Exchange, where meeting Mr. Creed and Moore we three to a house hard by (which I was not pleased with) to dinner.

1662-08-01 08:30   Up, my head aching, and to my office, where Cooper read me another lecture upon my modell very pleasant.
