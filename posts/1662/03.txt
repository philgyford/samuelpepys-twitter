1662-03-31 17:07   To the play, where coming late, and meeting with Sir W. Pen, who had got room for my wife and his daughter in the pit, he and I into one of the boxes, and there we sat and heard “The Little Thiefe,” a pretty play and well done.

1662-03-31 14:13   To Sir Thomas Crew’s lodgings. He hath been ill, and continues so, under fits of apoplexy. He and I did discourse much of Mr. Montagu’s base doings, and the dishonour that he will do my Lord, as well as cheating him of 2 or 3,000l., which is too true.


1662-03-30 20:57   So to supper, which is also well served in. We had a lobster to supper, with a crabb Pegg Pen sent my wife this afternoon, the reason of which we cannot think; but something there is of plot or design in it, for we have a little while carried ourselves pretty strange to them.

1662-03-30 19:04   Having my old black suit new furbished, I was pretty neat in clothes today, and my boy, his old suit new trimmed, very handsome.

1662-03-30 16:30 r And after sermon she and I did stay behind them in the pew, and went out by ourselves a good while after them, which we judge a very fine project hereafter to avoyd contention.

1662-03-30 15:22   My wife and I to church in the afternoon, and seated ourselves, she below me, and by that means the precedence of the pew, which my Lady Batten and her daughter takes, is confounded.

1662-03-30 14:02   Dined with my wife, a good shoulder of veal well dressed by Jane, and handsomely served to table, which pleased us much, and made us hope that she will serve our turn well enough.

1662-03-30 11:10   To church, and so home, leaving the two Sir Williams to take the Sacrament, which I blame myself that I have hitherto neglected all my life, but once or twice at Cambridge.


1662-03-29 16:29   Up to my Lady, and staid two hours talking with her about her family business with great content and confidence in me.


1662-03-28 17:49   At home all the morning, and dined with my wife, a good dinner. At my office all the afternoon.


1662-03-27 07:27 r By which means not only the King pays wages while the ship has lain still, but the poor men have been forced to borrow all the money due for their wages, and that at a dear rate, so that many of them had very little to receive at the table, which grieved me to see it.

1662-03-27 07:24 r We settled to pay the Guernsey, a small ship, but come to a great deal of money, it having been unpaid ever since before the King came in.

1662-03-27 06:00   Sir G. Carteret, both Sir Williams and I by coach to Deptford, it being very windy and rainy weather, taking a codd and some prawnes in Fish Street with us.


1662-03-26 19:10 r We had a man-cook to dress dinner today, and sent for Jane to help us, and my wife and she agreed at 3l. a year (she would not serve under) till both could be better provided, and so she stays with us, and I hope we shall do well if poor Sarah were but rid of her ague.

1662-03-26 18:47 r We were very merry all the afternoon, talking and singing and piping upon the flageolette. In the evening they went with great pleasure away, and I with great content and my wife walked half an hour in the garden.

1662-03-26 14:39 r I had a pretty dinner for them, viz., a brace of stewed carps, six roasted chickens, and a jowl of salmon, hot, for the first course; a tanzy and two neats’ tongues, and cheese the second.

1662-03-26 12:04   At noon come my good guests, Madame Turner, The., and Cozen Norton, and a gentleman, one Mr. Lewin of the King’s LifeGuard; by the same token he told us of one of his fellows killed this morning in a duel.

1662-03-26 06:04   This being, by God’s great blessing, the fourth solemn day of my cutting for the stone this day four years, and am by God’s mercy in very good health, and like to do well, the Lord’s name be praised for it.


1662-03-25 13:40   All the morning at the office. Dined with my wife at home.


1662-03-24 22:30   So home and to bed.

1662-03-24 21:00   I to Sir W. Batten’s, and supped there out of pure hunger and to save getting anything ready at home, which is a thing I do not nor shall not use to do.

1662-03-24 19:44   Went to Westminster Hall, and there bought Mr. Grant’s book of observations upon the weekly bills of mortality, which appear to me upon first sight to be very pretty.

1662-03-24 14:55   By and by comes La Belle Pierce to see my wife, and to bring her a pair of peruques of hair, as the fashion now is for ladies to wear; which are pretty, and are of my wife’s own hair, or else I should not endure them.

1662-03-24 13:33 r Having put things in very good order home, where I found Jane, my old maid, come out of the country, and I have a mind to have her again.

1662-03-24 12:03 r Here we staid talking, and eating and drinking a good ham of English bacon.

1662-03-24 05:32   Sir G. Carteret, both Sir Williams and I on board the Experiment, to dispatch her away, she being to carry things to the Madeiras with the East Indy fleet.


1662-03-23 16:40   Met with Captn. Isham, this day come from Lisbon, with letters from the Queen to the King. And he did give me letters which speak that our fleet is all at Lisbon; and that the Queen do not intend to embarque sooner than tomorrow come fortnight.

1662-03-23 13:30   Home with Sir W. Batten, and there eat some boiled great oysters, and so home, and while I was at dinner with my wife I was sick, and was forced to vomit up my oysters again, and then I was well.

1662-03-23 12:04   This morning was brought me my boy’s fine livery, which is very handsome, and I do think to keep to black and gold lace upon gray, being the colour of my arms, for ever.


1662-03-22 18:48   I vexed to find Griffin leave the office door open, and had a design to have carried away the screw or the carpet in revenge to him, but at last I would not, but sent for him and chid him.

1662-03-22 13:57 r Among others one Jefferys, a merry man that is a fumbler, and he and I called brothers, and he made all the mirth in the company. We had a very fine dinner, and all our wives’ healths, with seven or nine guns apiece; and exceeding merry we were.

1662-03-22 12:33   Sir Williams both and I by water down to the Lewes, Captain Dekins, his ship, a merchantman, where we met the owners, Sir John Lewes and Alderman Lewes, and several other great merchants.


1662-03-21 22:06   Home, and staid late writing at my office, and so home and to bed, troubled that now my boy is also fallen sick of an ague we fear.

1662-03-21 15:44   I walked into Cheapside, and there saw my little picture, for which I am to sit again the next week.

1662-03-21 11:32   I met with Chetwind, Parry, and several others, and went to a little house behind the Lords’ house to drink some wormwood ale, which doubtless was a bawdy house, the mistress of the house having the look and dress.

1662-03-21 08:55   I went to see Sarah and my Lord’s lodgings, which are now all in dirt, to be repaired against my Lord’s coming from sea with the Queen.


1662-03-20 22:28   Home and to bed, my mind in good ease when I mind business, which methinks should be a good argument to me never to do otherwise.


1662-03-19 19:30   I do begin to digest my uncle the Captain’s papers into one book, which I call my Brampton book, for the clearer understanding things how they are with us.

1662-03-19 17:48   All the morning and afternoon at my office putting things in order.


1662-03-18 21:08   Back home again, and I write to my father by the post about Brampton Court, which is now coming on. But that which troubles me is that my Father has now got an ague that I fear may endanger his life.

1662-03-18 15:29   Sir W. Pen and I on board some of the ships now fitting for East Indys and Portugall, to see in what forwardness they are.


1662-03-17 15:55   Last night the Blackmore pink brought the three prisoners, Barkestead, Okey, and Corbet, to the Tower, being taken at Delfe in Holland; where the Dutch were a good while before they could be persuaded to let them go, they being taken prisoners in their land.

1662-03-17 12:32   All the morning at the office by myself about setting things in order there, and so at noon to the Exchange to see and be seen.


1662-03-16 21:45 r Fearing that Sarah would continue ill, wife and I removed this night to our matted chamber and lay there.

1662-03-16 21:08 r Drinking of cold small beer here I fell ill, and was forced to go out and vomit, and so was well again and went home by and by to bed.

1662-03-16 19:45   I spent an hour walking in the garden with Sir W. Pen, and then my wife and I thither to supper, where his son William is at home not well. But all things, I fear, do not go well with them; they look discontentedly, but I know not what ails them.

1662-03-16 15:54   Walked to White Hall, an hour or two in the Park, which is now very pleasant. Here the King and Duke came to see their fowl play. The Duke took very civil notice of me.

1662-03-16 12:03   This morning, till churches were done, I spent going from one church to another and hearing a bit here and a bit there.


1662-03-15 11:09   To the Exchange to hire a ship for the Maderas, but could get none.


1662-03-14 19:18 r I find them most incomparable songs as he has set them, of which I am not a little proud, because I am sure none in the world has them but myself, not so much as he himself that set them.

1662-03-14 19:09   To my lute, upon which I have not played a week or two, and trying over the two songs of “Nulla, nulla,” &c., and “Gaze not on Swans,” which Mr. Berkenshaw set for me a little while ago.

1662-03-14 17:38   Home, where I found that Sarah the maid had been very ill all day, and my wife fears that she will have an ague, which I am much troubled for.

1662-03-14 16:55   I went to speak with my uncle Wight and found my aunt to have been ill a good while of a miscarriage, I staid and talked with her a good while.

1662-03-14 14:44 r But he do tell us, that when he comes to tell the King his secret (for none but the Kings, successively, and their heirs must know it), it will appear to be of no danger at all.

1662-03-14 14:34   Came the German Dr. Kuffler, to discourse with us about his engine to blow up ships. We doubted not the matter of fact, it being tried in Cromwell’s time, but the safety of carrying them in ships.

1662-03-14 12:00   Sir W. Pen and I making a bargain with the workmen about his house, at which I did see things not so well contracted for as I would have, and I was vexed and made him so too to see me so critical in the agreement.


1662-03-13 22:30   All day, either at the office or at home, busy about business till late at night, I having lately followed my business much, I find great pleasure in it, and a growing content.


1662-03-12 20:38   At the office from morning till night putting of papers in order, that so I may have my office in an orderly condition. I took much pains in sorting and folding of papers.

1662-03-12 09:50   We had news from Mr. Coventry, that Sir G. Downing (like a perfidious rogue, though the action is good and of service to the King, yet he cannot with any good conscience do it) hath taken Okey, Corbet, and Barkestead at Delfe, in Holland, and sent them home in the Blackmore.


1662-03-11 22:09   At the office all the morning, and all the afternoon rummaging of papers in my chamber, and tearing some and sorting others till late at night, and so to bed, my wife being not well all this day.


1662-03-10 13:39   At the office doing business all the morning, and my wife being gone to buy some things in the city I dined with Sir W. Batten.


1662-03-09 15:40   To Church again and heard Mr. Naylor, whom I knew formerly of Keye’s College, make a most eloquent sermon.


1662-03-08 22:10 r We at last did send him with a constable to the Counter; and did give warrants for the seizing of a complice of his, one Blinkinsopp.

1662-03-08 20:44   To the office and we sent for Sir Thos. Allen, one of the Aldermen of the City, about the business of one Colonel Appesley, whom we had taken counterfeiting of bills with all our hands and the officers of the yards, so well counterfeited that I should never have mistrusted them.

1662-03-08 11:13 r He told me, also, many more scurvy stories of Mr. Edwd. Montagu and his brother Ralph, which troubles me to hear of persons of honour as they are.

1662-03-08 11:10   Serjeant Pierce told me how my Lady Monk hath disposed of all the places which Mr. Edwd. Montagu hoped to have had, as he was Master of the Horse to the Queen; which I am afraid will undo him, because he depended much upon the profit of what he should make by these places.

1662-03-08 10:40   By coach with both Sir Williams to Westminster; this being a great day there in the House to pass the business for chimney-money, which was done.


1662-03-07 11:08 r He made a most learned sermon upon the words; but, in his application, the most comical man that ever I heard in my life.

1662-03-07 11:00   Early to White Hall to the chappell, where by Mr. Blagrave’s means I got into his pew, and heard Dr. Creeton, the great Scotchman, preach before the King, and Duke and Duchess, upon the words of Micah:— “Roule yourselves in dust.”


1662-03-06 19:07   To the office back again till night, we having been these four or five days very full of business, and I thank God I am well pleased with it, and hope I shall continue of that temper, which God grant.

1662-03-06 10:30   Home, where my Uncle Thomas (by promise and his son Tom) were come to give me his answer whether he would have me go to law or arbitracon with him, but he is unprovided to answer me, and desires two days more.


1662-03-05 21:53   Home and to my office, and there sat looking over my papers of my voyage, when we fetched over the King, and tore so many of these that were worth nothing, as filled my closet as high as my knees.

1662-03-05 10:33   To Tom’s about business, and so to the pewterer’s, to buy a poore’s-box to put my forfeits in, upon breach of my late vows.


1662-03-04 18:22 r After our walk we went to the Pope’s Head, and eat cakes and other fine things, and so home.

1662-03-04 16:04   Sir W. Pen and I and my wife in his coach to Moore Fields, where we walked a great while, though it was no fair weather and cold.

1662-03-04 02:01   Dined at home at noon, and then to the office again to put things in order there, my mind being very busy in settling the office to ourselves, I having now got distinct offices for the other two.


1662-03-03 22:48   I went home, where I found a vessel of oysters sent me from Chatham, so I fell to eat some and then to supper, and so after the barber had done to bed.

1662-03-03 19:21   I am told that the Parliament hath voted 2s. per annum for every chimney in England, as a constant revenue for ever to the Crown.

1662-03-03 11:10 r I do not doubt but hereafter to give a good account of my time and to grow rich, for I do find a great deal more of content in these few days, that I do spend well about my business, than in all the pleasure of a whole week.

1662-03-03 11:04   I set to make some strict rules for my future practice in my expenses, which I did bind myself in the presence of God by oath to observe upon penalty therein set down.


1662-03-02 09:28 r That is, be a knight, and keep my coach, which pleased her, and so I do hope we shall hereafter live to save something, for I am resolved to keep myself by rules from expenses.

1662-03-02 09:20   With my mind much eased talking long in bed with my wife about our frugall life for the time to come, proposing to her what I could and would do if I were worth 2,000l.


1662-03-01 21:18 r But I find that I had spent above 250l. this last half year, which troubles me much, but by God’s blessing I am resolved to take up, having furnished myself with all things for a great while, and tomorrow to think upon some rules and obligations upon myself to walk by.

1662-03-01 21:10   I settled to what I had long intended, to cast up my accounts with myself, and after much pains to do it and great fear, I do find that I am 500l. in money beforehand in the world, which I was afraid I was not.

1662-03-01 17:52 r I am resolved to go no more to see the first time of acting, for they were all of them out more or less.

1662-03-01 17:45   To the Opera, and there saw “Romeo and Juliet,” the first time it was ever acted; but it is a play of itself the worst that ever I heard in my life, and the worst acted that ever I saw these people do.

1662-03-01 14:48   Dined at home, and after dinner comes my uncle Thomas, with whom I had some high words of difference, but ended quietly, though I fear I shall do no good by fair means upon him.

1662-03-01 09:30   I paid Sir W. Batten 40l., which I have owed him this half year, having borrowed it of him.
