1662-03-31 17:07   To the play, and meeting with Sir W Pen, he and I into one of the boxes and there we heard “The Little Thiefe,” a pretty play and well done.

1662-03-31 14:13   To Sir Thomas Crew’s lodgings. He hath been ill, and continues so, under fits of apoplexy.

1662-03-30 20:57   We had a lobster to supper, with a crabb Pegg Pen sent my wife, the reason of which we cannot think; but something there is of plot in it.

1662-03-30 19:04   Having my old black suit new furbished, I was pretty neat in clothes to-day, and my boy, his old suit new trimmed, very handsome.

1662-03-30 16:22   My wife and I to walk an hour or two on the leads, which begins to be very pleasant, the garden being in good condition.

1662-03-30 14:02   Dined with my wife, a good shoulder of veal well dressed by Jane, which pleased us much, and made us hope that she will serve our turn.

1662-03-29 16:29   To my Lady, and staid two hours talking with her about her family business with great content and confidence in me.

1662-03-28 17:49   At home all the morning, and dined with my wife, a good dinner. At my office all the afternoon.

1662-03-27 06:00   Sir G. Carteret, both Sir Williams and I to Deptford, it being windy and rainy, taking a codd and some prawnes in Fish Street with us.

1662-03-26 16:22   My wife and Jane agreed at 3l. a year (she would not serve under) till both could be better provided, and so she stays with us.

1662-03-26 14:59   We had a man-cook to dress dinner to-day, and sent for Jane to help us.

1662-03-26 14:40   A tanzy and two neats’ tongues, and cheese the second course.

1662-03-26 14:39   I had a pretty dinner for my guests, viz., a brace of stewed carps, six roasted chickens, and a jowl of salmon, hot, for the first course;

1662-03-26 12:04   At noon come my good guests, Madame Turner, The., and Cozen Norton, and a gentleman, one Mr. Lewin of the King’s LifeGuard.

1662-03-26 06:04   This being, by God’s blessing, the fourth solemn day of my cutting for the stone this day four years, and am by God’s mercy in very health.

1662-03-25 13:40   All the morning at the office. Dined with my wife at home.

1662-03-24 22:30   So home and to bed.

1662-03-24 21:00   To Sir W. Batten’s, and supped there out of pure hunger and to save getting anything ready at home.

1662-03-24 19:44   To Westminster Hall, and bought Mr. Grant’s book of observations upon the weekly bills of mortality, which appear to me to be very pretty.

1662-03-24 13:42   Comes La Belle Pierce to see my wife, and to bring her a pair of peruques of hair, as the fashion now is for ladies to wear.

1662-03-24 05:32   Sir G. Carteret, both Sir Williams and I on board the Experiment, she being to carry things to the Madeiras with the East Indy fleet.

1662-03-23 10:04   Was brought me my boy’s livery, which is handsome, and I do think to keep to black and gold lace upon gray, the colour of my arms, for ever.

1662-03-22 13:57   We had a very fine dinner, and all our wives’ healths, with seven or nine guns apiece; and exceeding merry we were.

1662-03-22 12:33   Sir Williams both and I by water down to the Lewes, Captain Dekins, his ship, a merchantman, where we met the owners.

1662-03-21 22:06   Staid late writing at my office, and so home and to bed, troubled that now my boy is also fallen sick of an ague we fear.

1662-03-21 15:44   I walked into Cheapside, and there saw my little picture, for which I am to sit again the next week.

1662-03-21 11:32   Went to a little house behind the Lords’ house to drink some wormwood ale, which doubtless was a bawdy house, the mistress having the look.

1662-03-21 08:55   I went to see Sarah and my Lord’s lodgings, which are now all in dirt, to be repaired against my Lord’s coming from sea with the Queen.

1662-03-20 22:28   My mind in good ease when I mind business, which methinks should be a good argument to me never to do otherwise.

1662-03-19 17:48   All the morning and afternoon at my office putting things in order.

1662-03-18 21:08   That which troubles me is that my Father has now got an ague that I fear may endanger his life.

1662-03-18 15:29   Sir W. Pen and I on board some of the ships now fitting for East Indys and Portugall, to see in what forwardness they are.

1662-03-17 12:02   To the Exchange to see and be seen.

1662-03-16 22:08   Drinking of cold small beer I fell ill, and was forced to go out and vomit, and so was well again and went home by and by to bed.

1662-03-16 16:10   The Duke took very civil notice of me.

1662-03-16 15:54   Walked to White Hall, an hour or two in the Park, which is now very pleasant. Here the King and Duke came to see their fowl play.

1662-03-15 11:09   To the Exchange to hire a ship for the Maderas, but could get none.

1662-03-14 19:18   I find them most incomparable songs as he has set them, of which I am not a little proud, because none in the world has them but myself.

1662-03-14 19:09   To my lute, and trying over the two songs of “Nulla, nulla,” &c, and “Gaze not on Swans,” which Mr. Berkenshaw set for me a while ago.

1662-03-14 17:38   I found that Sarah the maid had been very ill all day, and my wife fears that she will have an ague, which I am much troubled for.

1662-03-14 16:55   I went to speak with my uncle Wight and found my aunt to have been ill a good while of a miscarriage. I staid and talked with her a while.

1662-03-14 14:44   Dr. Kuffler do tell us, that when he comes to tell the King his secret, it will appear to be of no danger at all.

1662-03-14 14:38   We doubted not the matter of fact, it being tried in Cromwell’s time, but the safety of carrying the engines in ships.

1662-03-14 14:04   Came the German Dr. Kuffler, to discourse with us about his engine to blow up ships.

1662-03-13 19:57   I having lately followed my business much, I find great pleasure in it, and a growing content.

1662-03-12 20:38   At the office from morning till night putting of papers in order, that so I may have my office in an orderly condition.

1662-03-11 22:09   All the afternoon rummaging of papers in my chamber, tearing some and sorting others, and so to bed, my wife being not well all this day.

1662-03-10 13:39   At the office doing business all the morning, and my wife being gone to buy some things in the city I dined with Sir W. Batten.

1662-03-09 15:40   To Church again and heard Mr. Naylor, whom I knew formerly of Keye’s College, make a most eloquent sermon.

1662-03-08 22:10   At last did send Col. Appesley with a constable to the Counter; and did give warrants for the seizing of a complice of his, one Blinkinsopp.

1662-03-08 20:44   We sent for Sir Thos. Allen, about the business of one Colonel Appesley, whom we had taken counterfeiting of bills.

1662-03-08 09:00   By coach with both Sir Williams to Westminster; this being a great day there in the House to pass the business for chimney-money.

1662-03-07 11:00   To White Hall, and heard Dr. Creeton, the great Scotchman, preach before the King, upon the words of Micah:— “Roule yourselves in dust.”

1662-03-06 19:07   We having been these four or five days full of business and I thank God I am well pleased with it, and hope I shall continue of that temper.

1662-03-06 10:30   My Uncle Thomas was come to give me his answer whether he would have me go to law or arbitracon with him, but he is unprovided to answer me.

1662-03-05 21:53   Looking over my papers of my voyage, and tore so many of these that were worth nothing, as filled my closet as high as my knees.

1662-03-05 10:33   To Tom’s about business, and so to the pewterer’s, to buy a poore’s-box to put my forfeits in, upon breach of my late vows.

1662-03-04 18:22   After our walk we went to the Pope’s Head, and eat cakes and other fine things, and so home.

1662-03-04 16:04   Sir W. Pen and I and my wife in his coach to Moore Fields, where we walked a great while, though it was no fair weather and cold.

1662-03-03 22:48   I found a vessel of oysters sent me from Chatham, so I fell to eat some and then to supper, and so after the barber had done to bed.

1662-03-03 19:21   I am told that this day the Parliament hath voted 2s. per annum for every chimney in England, as a constant revenue for ever to the Crown.

1662-03-03 11:10   I do find a great deal more of content in these few days, that I do spend well about my business, than in all the pleasure of a whole week.

1662-03-03 11:04   I set to make some strict rules for my future practice in my expenses, which I did bind myself in the presence of God by oath to observe.

1662-03-02 09:28   Proposing to my wife what I could and would do if I were worth 2,000l., that is, be a knight, and keep my coach, which pleased her.

1662-03-02 09:20   With my mind much eased talking long in bed with my wife about our frugall life for the time to come.

1662-03-01 21:18   I am resolved to-morrow to think upon some rules and obligations upon myself to walk by.

1662-03-01 21:10   I settled to cast up my accounts, and after much pains to do it and great fear, I do find that I am 500l. in money beforehand in the world.

1662-03-01 17:52   I am resolved to go no more to see the first time of acting, for they were all of them out more or less.

1662-03-01 17:45   Saw “Romeo and Juliet,” the first time it was ever acted; but it is a play of itself the worst that ever I heard in my life.

1662-03-01 14:48   Dined at home, and after dinner comes my uncle Thomas, with whom I had some high words of difference, but ended quietly.

1662-03-01 09:30   I paid Sir W. Batten 40l., which I have owed him this half year, having borrowed it of him.
