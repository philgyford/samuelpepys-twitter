1667-11-30 21:02   My Lord Anglesey told me this day that he did believe the House of Commons would, the next week, yield to the Lords; but, speaking with others this day, they conclude they will not, but that rather the King will accommodate it by committing my Lord Clarendon himself.

1667-11-30 18:01 r I saw a pretty deception of the sight by a glass with water poured into it, with a stick standing up with three balls of wax upon it, one distant from the other. How these balls did seem double and disappear one after another, mighty pretty!

1667-11-30 16:37 r He had but 20s. for his suffering it, and is to have the same again tried upon him: the first sound man that ever had it tried on him in England, and but one that we hear of in France, which was a porter hired by the virtuosos.

1667-11-30 16:34 r Here I was pleased to see the person who had his blood taken out. He speaks well, and did give the Society a relation thereof in Latin, saying that he finds himself much better since, but he is cracked a little in his head, though he speaks very reasonably, and very well.

1667-11-30 15:47 r Dr. Wilkins, talking of the universal speech, of which he hath a book coming out, did first inform me how man was certainly made for society, he being of all creatures the least armed for defence; and, he says, were it not for speech man would be a very mean creature.

1667-11-30 14:55 r To Cary House, a house now of entertainment, next my Lord Ashly’s; and there, where I have heretofore heard Common Prayer in the time of Dr. Mossum, we after two hours’ stay, sitting at the table with our napkins open, had our dinners brought, but badly done.

1667-11-30 11:50   To Arundel House, to the election of Officers for the next year; where I was near being chosen of the Council, but am glad I was not, for I could not have attended, though, above all things, I could wish it; and do take it as a mighty respect to have been named there.

1667-11-29 17:15   To the office both forenoon and afternoon, mighty hard putting papers and things in order to my extraordinary satisfaction, and consulting my clerks in many things, who are infinite helps to my memory and reasons of things.

1667-11-29 09:40   Sir W. Pen and I did walk together a good while, and he tells me that the Houses are not likely to agree after their free conference yesterday, and he fears what may follow.

1667-11-29 08:33 r It is one of the most extraordinary accidents in my life, and gives ground to think of Don Quixote’s adventures how people may be surprised.

1667-11-29 08:27 r And so we sent, and their chimnies have been swept this morning, and the noise was that, and nothing else.

1667-11-29 08:22 r But Jane heard a noise in the great stack of chimnies that goes from Sir J. Minnes through our house.

1667-11-29 08:17 r So up again, and when Jane come, and we demanded whether she heard no noise, she said, “yes, and was afeard,” but rose with the other maid, and found nothing.

1667-11-29 08:13 r Then more freely about, and to the kitchen, where the cook-maid up, and all safe.

1667-11-29 08:09 r Called Jane up, and went down safely, and opened my chamber door, where all well.

1667-11-29 08:07 r Then (with fear, I confess) went to the maid’s chamber-door, and all quiet and safe.

1667-11-29 08:04 r At last, I removed my gown and slippers safely to the other side of the bed over my wife: and there safely rose, and put on my gown and breeches, and then, with a firebrand in my hand, safely opened the door, and saw nor heard any thing.

1667-11-29 07:40 r We did both conclude that thieves were in the house, but wondered what our people did, whom we thought either killed, or afeard, as we were.

1667-11-29 07:31 r We lay, both of us, afeard; yet I would have rose, but my wife would not let me. Besides, I could not do it without making noise.

1667-11-29 07:12 r I then waked my wife, and both of us wondered at it, and lay so a while, while that increased, and at last heard it plainer, knocking, as if it were breaking down a window for people to get out; and then removing of stools and chairs; and plainly going up and down our stairs.

1667-11-29 06:58   Waked about seven o’clock this morning with a noise I supposed I heard, near our chamber, of knocking, which, by and by, increased: and I, more awake, could, distinguish it better.

1667-11-28 17:23 r Here I met with Sir. Richard Browne, who wondered to find me there, telling me that I am a man of so much business, which character, I thank God, I have ever got, and have for a long time had, and yet am now come to be censured in common with the office for a man of negligence.

1667-11-28 17:09   To the King’s playhouse and there sat by my wife, and saw “The Mistaken Beauty” which I never saw before, though an old play; and there is much in it that I like, though the name is but improper to it — at least, that name, it being also called “The Lyer” which is proper enough.

1667-11-28 14:22   I to White Hall, there intending, with Lord Bruncker, Sir J. Minnes, and Sir T. Harvy to have seen the Duke of York, whom it seems the King and Queen have visited, and so we may now well go to see him. But there was nobody could speak with him, and so we parted.

1667-11-27 20:34   I with my boy Tom to my bookbinder’s, where all the afternoon long till 8 or 9 at night seeing him binding up two or three collections of letters and papers that I had of him, but above all things my little abstract pocket book of contracts, which he will do very neatly.

1667-11-27 13:58   Mr. Pierce tells me how the King is now fallen in and become a slave to the Duke of Buckingham, led by none but him, whom he, Mr. Pierce, swears he knows do hate the very person of the King, and would, as well as will, certainly ruin him.

1667-11-27 12:06   All the morning at my Lord Bruncker’s lodgings with Sir J. Minnes and W. Pen about Sir W. Warren’s accounts, wherein I do not see that they are ever very likely to come to an understanding of them, as Sir J. Minnes hath not yet handled them.

1667-11-26 19:20   Comes to me to my closet at the Office Sir John Chichly, of his own accord, to tell me what he shall answer to the Committee, when, as he expects, he shall be examined about my Lord Sandwich; which is so little as will not hurt my Lord at all, I know.

1667-11-26 16:00   Back to the Old Exchange, and there at my goldsmith’s bought a basin for my wife to give the Parson’s child, to which the other day she was godmother. It cost me; 10l. 14s. besides graving, which I do with the cypher of the name, Daniel Mills.

1667-11-26 15:03   By coach as far as the Temple, and there saw a new book, in folio, of all that suffered for the King in the late times, which I will buy, it seems well writ.

1667-11-26 13:39   Home to dinner, where dined Mr. Clerke, solicitor, with me, to discourse about my Tangier accounts, which I would fain make up, but I have not time.

1667-11-25 20:48   Home, and there to read, and my wife to read to me out of Sir Robert Cotton’s book about warr, which is very fine, showing how the Kings of England have raised money by the people heretofore upon the people, and how they have played upon the kings also.

1667-11-25 14:10   Finishing my letter to Sir Robert Brookes, which I did with great content, and yet I read it over again after it was sealed and delivered to the messenger, and read it to my clerks who dined with me, and there I did resolve upon some alteration, and caused it to be new writ.

1667-11-25 00:08 r I did alter my whole counsel, and fall to arme myself with good reasons to justify the Office in so doing, which hath been but rare, and having done this, I went, with great quiet in my mind, home, though vexed that so honest a business should bring me so much trouble.

1667-11-25 00:04   W. Hewer and I in the Office, and he, which was a good service, did so inform me in the consequences of my writing this report, and that what I said would not hold water, in denying this Board to have ever ordered the discharging out of the service whole ships by ticket.

1667-11-24 21:10   I laboured till nine at night with Mr. Gibbs, in drawing up the history of all that hath passed concerning tickets, in order to the laying the whole, and clearing myself and Office, before Sir R. Brookes; and in this I took great pains.

1667-11-23 22:20   Busy preparing things to fortify myself and fellows against the Parliament; particularly against what I fear is thought, that I have suppressed the Order of the Board by which the discharging the ships off at Chatham by tickets was directed; whereas there was no such Order.

1667-11-22 11:04   To the Temple, and there walked a good while in the Temple church, observing the plainness of Selden’s tomb, and how much better one of his executors hath, who is buried by him.

1667-11-22 09:40 r My Lord himself, my Lord Chancellor’s son, hath moved that if they have Treason against him, that they would specify it and send it up to the Lords, that he might come to his trial; so full of intrigues this business is!

1667-11-22 09:36   I understand further, that this stiffness of the Lords is in no manner of kindness to my Lord Chancellor, but rather the contrary; but that they do fear what the consequence may be to themselves, should they yield in his case, as many of them have reason.

1667-11-21 22:30 r  My eyes being bad I spent the evening with my wife in her chamber talking and inventing a cypher to put on a piece of plate, which I must give, better than ordinary, to the Parson’s child,

1667-11-21 21:15   To my wife, and she tells me stories of the gossiping women of the parish — what this and what that woman was; and how Mrs. Hollworthy is the veriest confident bragging gossip of them all; but that Sir R. Brookes was mighty civil to her, and taken with her, and what not.

1667-11-21 20:48 r Dr. Whistler told a story of Dr. Caius, that built Keys College; that, being old, and living only upon woman’s milk, he, while he fed upon the milk of an angry, fretful woman, was so himself; and then, being advised to take it of a good-natured, patient woman, he did become so.

1667-11-21 20:14 r They purpose to let in about twelve ounces. They differ in the opinion they have of the effects of it; some think it may have a good effect upon him as a frantic man by cooling his blood, others that it will not have any effect at all.

1667-11-21 20:10 r They discourse of a man that is a little frantic, that hath been a kind of minister, that is poor and a debauched man, that the College have hired for 20s. to have some of the blood of a sheep let into his body; and it is to be done on Saturday next.

1667-11-21 19:17 r It seems my Lord Chancellor hath, as is said and believed, had his horses several times in his coach, ready to carry him to the Tower, expecting a message to that purpose; but by this means his case is like to be laid by.

1667-11-21 19:05 r It is conceived that much of this eagerness among the Lords do arise from the fear some of them have, that they may be dealt with in the same manner themselves, and therefore do stand upon it now.

1667-11-21 18:57 r I do hear, that upon the reading of the House of Commons’s Reasons of the manner of their proceedings in the business of my Lord Chancellor, the Reasons were so bad, that my Lord Bristoll himself did declare that he would not stand to what he had.

1667-11-21 18:20   I out and took coach to Arundell House, where the meeting of Gresham College was broke up; but there meeting Creed, I with him to the taverne in St. Clement’s Churchyard, where was Deane Wilkins, Dr. Whistler, Dr. Floyd, and other brave men.

1667-11-21 12:05   Home, where my wife not very well, but is to go to Mr. Mills’s child’s christening, where she is godmother, Sir J. Minnes and Sir R. Brookes her companions.

1667-11-20 13:20   All the morning Mr. Hater and the boy did shut up themselves at my house doing something towards the finishing the abstract book of our contracts for my pocket, which I shall now want very much.

1667-11-20 12:05   Home to dinner with my clerks, who have of late dined frequently with me, and I do purpose to have them so still, by that means I having opportunity to talk with them about business, and I love their company very well.

1667-11-20 11:10   At my office shut up with Mr. Gibson, I walking and he reading to me the order books of the office from the beginning of the war, for preventing the Parliament’s having them in their hands before I have looked them over.

1667-11-19 21:20   My father did this week, by Shepley, return me up a ’guinny, which, it seems, upon searching the ground, they have found since I was there.

1667-11-19 20:15   I wrote to my father, in answer to a new match which is proposed (the executor of Ensum, my sister’s former servant) for my sister, that I will continue my mind of giving her 500l., if he likes of the match.

1667-11-19 11:03   I, by the Board’s direction, to the Parliament House to speak with Sir R. Brookes about the meaning of an order come to us this day to bring all the books of the office to the Committee.

1667-11-18 21:45   Took up my wife, whom I had left at her tailor’s, and home, and there, to save my eyes, got my wife at home to read again, out of Fuller’s Church History, till W. Batelier come and spent the evening talking with us, and supped with us.

1667-11-18 15:09   Up, and all the morning at my office till 3 after noon with Mr. Hater about perfecting my little pocket market book of the office, till my eyes were ready to fall out of my head.

1667-11-17 18:32   Captain Cocke tells me that he hears that Sir W. Coventry was, a little before the Duke of York fell sick, with the Duke of York in his closet, and fell on his knees, and begged his pardon for what he hath done to my Lord Chancellor; but this I dare not soon believe.

1667-11-17 16:13   A dull sermon of Mr. Mills, and then home, without strangers to dinner, and then my wife to read, and I to the office, enter my journall to this day, and so home with great content that it is done, but with sorrow to my eyes.

1667-11-16 20:50 r Here was the King and Queen, and some of the ladies; among whom none more jolly than my Lady Buckingham, her Lord being once more a great man.

1667-11-16 20:37 r I to the theater-room and there heard both the vocall and instrumentall music, where Pelham stood keeping time; but I see no great matter, but quite the contrary. The composition is good, but no more of delightfulness to the eare or understanding but what is very ordinary.

1667-11-16 19:20 r He fears some furious courses will be taken against the Duke of York; and that he hath heard that it was designed, if they cannot carry matters against the Chancellor, to impeach the Duke of York himself, which God forbid!

1667-11-16 19:17 r It is plain that there is dislike between the King and Duke of York, and that it is to be feared that the House will go so far against the Chancellor, that they must do something to undo the Duke of York, or will not think themselves safe.

1667-11-16 19:15 r I met Mr. Gregory, and what I learn from him is this: The King is the most concerned in the world against the Chancellor, and all people that do not appear against him, and therefore is angry with the Bishops.

1667-11-16 18:30   To White Hall. I did go into the music-room, and here I did hear the best and the smallest organ go that ever I saw in my life, and such a one as by the grace of God I will have the next year if I continue in this condition, whatever it cost me. I never was so pleased in my life.

1667-11-16 09:00   I told my Lord Bruncker of his man Carcasses proceedings against the Office in the House of Commons. I did desire nor advise him anything, but in general, that the end of this might be ruin to the Office, but that we shall be brought to fencing for ourselves.

1667-11-15 21:27   After supper, I got the girl to comb my head, and then to bed, my eyes bad.

1667-11-15 11:20 r Every body says he is able, but to hear how he laughs at the King’s music here, as Blagrave and others, that they cannot keep time nor tune; and that Grebus, the King’s master of the musique, how he understands nothing, nor can play on any instrument, and so cannot compose.

1667-11-15 11:15   Calling at my mercer’s and tailor’s, and there find, as I expected, Mr. Caesar and little Pelham Humphreys, lately returned from France, and is an absolute Monsieur, as full of form, and confidence, and vanity, and disparages everything, and everybody’s skill but his own.

1667-11-14 21:15   Home to supper, and to bed, my eyes being bad again; and by this means, the nights, now-a-days, do become very long to me, longer than I can sleep out.

1667-11-14 12:47   All my clerks with me to dinner, to a venison pasty; and there comes Creed, and dined with me, and he tells me how high the Lords were in the Lords’ House about the business of the Chancellor, and that they are not yet agreed to impeach him.

1667-11-13 21:17 r This I hope in God will bind me, for I do find myself mightily wronged in my reputation, and indeed in my purse and business, by my late following of my pleasure for so long time as I have done.

1667-11-13 21:15   To my chamber, and do begin anew to bind myself to keep my old vows, and among the rest not to see a play till Christmas but once in every other week, and have laid aside 10l., which is to be lost to the poor, if I do.

1667-11-13 17:27   My wife and Willet to the Duke of York’s house, and there saw the Tempest again, which is very pleasant, and full of so good variety that I cannot be more pleased almost in a comedy, only the seamen’s part a little too tedious.

1667-11-13 09:37   I met with Mr. Wren, who tells me that the Duke of York is in as good condition as is possible for a man, in his condition of the smallpox.

1667-11-12 16:58   To my office, and there saw every thing finished, so as my papers are all in order again and my office twice as pleasant as ever it was, having a noble window in my closet and another in my office, to my great content.

1667-11-12 10:50   I hear that my Lord Chancellor, to another of his Articles, that of betraying the King’s councils to his enemies, is voted to have matter against him for an impeachment of High Treason and that this day the impeachment is to be carried up to the House of Lords which is very high.

1667-11-11 21:28   This day I hear Kirton, my bookseller, poor man, is dead, I believe, of grief for his losses by the fire.

1667-11-11 19:47   We home, and there I to my office, and saw it made clean from top to bottom, till I feared I took cold in walking in a damp room while it is in washing.

1667-11-11 17:20   My wife, and I, and Willett, to the King’s play-house, and there saw “The Indian Emperour,” a good play, but not so good as people cry it up, I think, though above all things Nell’s ill speaking of a great part made me mad.

1667-11-11 13:30   I had a whole doe sent me by Mr. Hozier, which is a fine present, and I had the umbles of it for dinner.

1667-11-11 09:17 r He tells me that as soon as Secretary Morrice brought the Great Seale from my Lord Chancellor, Bab. May fell upon his knees, and catched the King about the legs and said that this was the first time that ever he could call him King of England: which was a most ridiculous saying.

1667-11-11 09:04   Sir G. Carteret and I toward the Temple in coach together; and there he did tell me how the King do all he can in the world to overthrow my Lord Chancellor, and that notice is taken of every man about the King that is not seen to promote the ruine of the Chancellor.

1667-11-10 22:00   To bed, my head running upon our businesses in Parliament and what examinations we are likely to go under before they have done with us, which troubles me more than it should a wise man and a man the best able to defend himself of our own whole office, I am apt to think.

1667-11-10 14:15   I to White Hall and there do hear that the Duke of York hath got, and is full of, the small-pox; and so we to his lodgings; and there find most of the family going to St. James’s, and the gallery doors locked up, that nobody might pass to nor fro and a sad house, I am sure.

1667-11-10 10:10   Mighty cold, and with my wife to church, where a lazy sermon. Here was my Lady Batten in her mourning at church, but I took no notice of her.

1667-11-09 20:14 r Home and to my letters by the post tonight, and there, by W. Pen, do hear that this article was overvoted in the House not to be a ground of impeachment of treason, at which I was glad, being willing to have no blood spilt, if I could help it.

1667-11-09 09:47 r He desirous to get back into the House, he having his notes in his hand, the lawyers being now speaking to the point of whether treason or not treason, the article of advising the King to break up the Parliament, and to govern by the sword.

1667-11-09 09:42 r I spoke with my cozen Roger Pepys, whose business was only to give me notice that Carcasse hath been before the Committee; and to warn me of it, which is a great courtesy in him to do, and I desire him to continue to do so.

1667-11-09 09:10   I to Westminster, and there find the House very busy, and like to be so all day, about my Lord Chancellor’s impeachment, whether treason or not, where every body is mighty busy.

1667-11-08 14:00   I to my workmen, who this day come to alter my office, by beating down the wall, and making me a fayre window both there, and increasing the window of my closet, which do give me some present trouble; but will be mighty pleasant.

1667-11-08 11:50   I hear that the Duke of York is very ill; and by and by word brought us that we shall not need to attend today the Duke of York, for he is not well, which is bad news.

1667-11-07 17:12 r The most innocent play that ever I saw; and a curious piece of musique in an echo of half sentences, the echo repeating the former half, while the man goes on to the latter; which is mighty pretty. The play no great wit, but yet good, above ordinary plays.

1667-11-07 13:30   To see “The Tempest,” an old play of Shakespeare’s, acted, I hear, the first day. And so my wife, and girl, and W. Hewer by themselves, and Sir W. Pen and I afterwards by ourselves; and forced to sit in the side balcone over against the musique-room at the Duke’s house.

1667-11-06 17:20   With my wife to a play, and the girl, “Macbeth,” which we still like mightily, though mighty short of the content we used to have when Betterton acted, who is still sick.

1667-11-06 08:28   Sir G. Downing tells me that the thing the House is just now upon is that of taking away the charter from the Company of Woodmongers, whose frauds, it seems, have been mightily laid before them. He tells me that they are like to fly very high against my Lord Chancellor.

1667-11-05 12:04   Up, and all the morning at the office.

1667-11-04 11:48   I took a coach, and went to Turlington, the great spectacle-maker, for advice, who dissuades me from using old spectacles, but rather young ones, and do tell me that nothing can wrong my eyes more than for me to use reading-glasses, which do magnify much.

1667-11-04 10:55 r And this Sir H. Cholmly fears may be by divorcing the Queen and getting another, or declaring the Duke of Monmouth legitimate; which God forbid!

1667-11-04 10:52 r And that the Duke of York is troubled much, knowing that those that fling down the Chancellor cannot stop there, but will do something to him, to prevent his having it in his power hereafter to avenge himself and father-in-law upon them.

1667-11-04 10:40   Sir H. Cholmly tells me he do think really that they will cut off my Lord Chancellor’s head, the Chancellor at this day showing as much pride as is possible to those few that venture their fortunes by coming to see him.

1667-11-04 09:12 r But Sir W. Coventry do say that, if he can get out of these briars, he will never trouble himself with Princes nor Dukes again. He finds several things in their Narratives, which are both inconsistent and foolish, as well as untrue.

1667-11-04 09:04   Sir W. Coventry read over to me the Prince’s and the Duke of Albemarle’s Narratives; wherein they are severe against him and our Office. But he do contemn them; only that their persons and qualities are great, and so I do perceive is afeard of them, though he will not confess it.

1667-11-03 22:30   I to my chamber, and there busy all the evening, and then my wife and I to supper, and so to bed, with much discourse and pleasure one with another.

1667-11-03 14:10 r My cozen Roger did tell me of a bargain which I may now have in Norfolke, that Nan Pepys is going to sell, the title whereof is very good; but it is out of the way so of my life, that I shall never enjoy it, nor, it may be, see it, and so I shall have nothing to do with it.

1667-11-03 13:57   Home to dinner, whither comes by invitation Mr. Turner, the minister, and my cozen Roger brought with him Jeffrys, the apothecary at Westminster, who is our kinsman, and we had much discourse of Cottenhamshire, and other things with great pleasure.

1667-11-02 17:30 r It was observable how a gentleman of good habit, sitting just before us, eating of some fruit in the midst of the play, did drop down as dead, being choked; but with much ado Orange Moll did thrust her finger down his throat, and brought him to life again.

1667-11-02 17:27   My wife and Willett and I to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “Henry the Fourth:” and contrary to expectation, was pleased in nothing more than in Cartwright’s speaking of Falstaffe’s speech about “What is Honour?”

1667-11-01 17:40   I away home, and there took out my wife, and she and I alone to the King’s playhouse, and there saw a silly play and an old one, “The Taming of a Shrew.”

1667-11-01 11:49   I to chapel and heard a fine anthem, made by Pelham in France, of which there was great expectation, and indeed is a very good piece of musique, but still I cannot call the Anthem anything but instrumentall music with the voice, for nothing is made of the words at all.

1667-11-01 10:23 r I also visited my Lord Hinchingbroke, at his chamber at White Hall, where I found Mr. Turner, Moore, and Creed, talking of my Lord Sandwich, whose case I doubt is but bad, and, I fear, will not escape being worse, though some of the company did say otherwise.

1667-11-01 10:02   I visited Sir G. Carteret, who is vexed to see how things are likely to go, but cannot help it, and yet seems to think himself mighty safe.

1667-11-01 09:13   Sir W. Coventry gives me the full of the Duke of Albemarle’s and Prince’s narratives, wherein they fall foul of him and Sir G. Carteret in something about the dividing of the fleet, and the Prince particularly charging the Commissioners of the Navy with negligence.
