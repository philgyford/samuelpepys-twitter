1667-07-31 22:36   Home with much pleasure, and so to my chamber, and my wife and I to pipe, and so to supper and to bed.

1667-07-31 19:30   Abroad with my wife by coach to Marrowbone, where my Lord Mayor and Aldermen, it seem, dined today: and were just now going away, methought, in a disconsolate condition, compared with their splendour they formerly had, when the City was standing.

1667-07-30 22:15   Home to supper: a pullet, with good sauce, to my liking, and then to play on the flageolet with my wife, which she now does very prettily, and so to bed.

1667-07-30 17:35 r From Mr. Cooling I gather that the story I learned yesterday is true — the King hath declared that he did not get the child of which my Lady Castlemayne is conceived, he having not as he says lain with her this half year. But she told him, “God damn me, but you shall own it!”

1667-07-30 17:14   To White Hall with Creed; in our way, meeting with Mr. Cooling, my Lord Chamberlain’s secretary, on horseback, who stopped to speak with us, and he proved very drunk, and did talk, and would have talked all night with us, I not being able to break loose from him.

1667-07-29 21:30   Home, and there to walk in the garden with my wife, telling her of my losing 300l. a year by my place that I am to part with, which do a little trouble me, but we must live with somewhat more thrift.

1667-07-29 18:22   Many guns were heard this afternoon, it seems, at White Hall and in the Temple garden very plain; but what it should be nobody knows, unless the Dutch be driving our ships up the river. Tomorrow we shall know.

1667-07-29 16:22 r Mr. Povy tells me that the King hath not greater enemies in the world than those of his own family; for there is not an officer in the house almost but curses him for letting them starve, and there is not a farthing of money to be raised for the buying them bread.

1667-07-29 16:14 r Mr. Povy told me how imperious my Lady Castlemayne is. It seems she is with child, and the King says he did not get it: with that she made a slighting “puh” with her mouth, and went out of the house, and never come in again till the King went to Sir Daniel Harvy’s to pray her.

1667-07-29 16:04   To the Treasury chamber. Looking out of the window into the garden, I saw the King (whom I have not had any desire to see since the Dutch come upon the coast first to Sheerness, for shame that I should see him, or he me, methinks, after such a dishonour) come upon the garden.

1667-07-29 14:18 r It hath been the very bad fortune of the Pepyses that ever I knew, never to marry an handsome woman, excepting Ned Pepys and Creed.

1667-07-29 14:16   My cozen Roger did acquaint me with an offer made of his marrying of Mrs. Elizabeth Wiles, whom I know; a kinswoman of Mr. Honiwood’s, an ugly old maid, but a good housewife; and is said to have 2500l. to her portion. I am against it in my heart, she being not handsome at all.

1667-07-29 13:32   My cozen Roger told us a thing certain, that the Archbishop of Canterbury; that now is, do keep a wench, and that he is as very a wencher as can be.

1667-07-29 11:35 r Here I saw several of the great men of the Commons, and some of them old men, that are come 200 miles and more, to attend this session of Parliament; and now all to no purpose, neither to serve their country, content themselves, nor receive any thanks from the King.

1667-07-29 11:20 r The kingdom never in so troubled a condition in this world as now; nobody pleased with the peace, and yet nobody daring to wish for the continuance of the war, it being plain that nothing do nor can thrive under us.

1667-07-29 10:55 r Thus they are dismissed again to their general great distaste, I believe the greatest that ever Parliament was, to see themselves so fooled, and the nation in certain condition of ruin, while the King, they see, is only governed by his lust, and women, and rogues about him.

1667-07-29 10:50 r Comes down the House of Commons, the King having made then a very short and no pleasing speech to them at all. He told them that he did think he should have had occasion for them, but had none, and therefore did dismiss them to look after their own occasions till October.

1667-07-29 10:25 r One thing extraordinary was, a man, a Quaker, came naked through the Hall, only very civilly tied about the privities to avoid scandal, and with a chafing-dish of fire and brimstone burning upon his head, did pass through the Hall, crying, “Repent! repent!”

1667-07-29 10:20   To Westminster Hall, where the Hall full of people to see the issue of the day, the King being come to speak to the House today.

1667-07-29 10:00 r In all things, in wisdom, courage, force, knowledge of our own streams, and success, the Dutch have the best of us, and do end the war with victory on their side.

1667-07-29 09:55 r But what a shame it is to consider how two of our ships’ companies did desert their ships for fear of being taken by their boats, our little frigates being forced to leave them, being chased by their greater!

1667-07-29 09:44 r Captain Jenifer told us that this new way used by Deane, of preparing of fire-ships, do not do the work; for the fire, not being quick enough to flame up so as to take the rigging and sails, lies smothering half an hour before it flames in which time they can get her off safely.

1667-07-29 09:18 r His failures were of several sorts, I know not which the truest: that he come with so strong a gale of wind, that his grapplings would not hold; that he did come by their lee; that they come up with a windward tide, and then they would not have come so fast.

1667-07-29 09:15   Up to the Duke of York’s chamber; and there all the talk was about Jordan’s coming with so much indiscretion, with his four little frigates and sixteen fire-ships from Harwich, to annoy the enemy.

1667-07-28 12:04   To my chamber to draw up a letter to Sir W. Coventry upon the tidings of peace, taking occasion to resign up to his Royal Highness my place of the Victualling, and to recommend myself to him by promise of doing my utmost to improve this peace, to save the kingdom from ruin.

1667-07-27 21:40   It raining this day all day to our great joy, it having not rained, I think, this month before, so as the ground was everywhere so burned and dry as could be; and no travelling in the road or streets in London, for dust.

1667-07-27 10:42 r Fenn tells me that the King and Court were never in the world so bad as they are now for gaming, swearing, whoring, and drinking, and the most abominable vices that ever were in the world; so that all must come to nought.

1667-07-27 10:30 r The King and my Lady Castlemayne are broke off, and she is with child, and swears the King shall own it; and she will have it christened in the Chapel so, and owned for the King’s; or she will bring it into White Hall gallery and dash the brains of it out before the King’s face.

1667-07-27 10:22   Fenn tells me that Sir John Coventry do bring the confirmation of the peace; but I do not find the ’Change at all glad of it, but rather the worse, they looking upon it as a peace made only to preserve the King for a time in his lusts and ease.

1667-07-27 09:12   Sir Jos. Jordan is come from Harwich, with sixteen fire-ships and four other little ships of war: and did attempt to do some execution upon the enemy, but did it without discretion, so as that they have been able to do no good, but have lost four of their fire ships.

1667-07-26 22:00   No news at all this day what we have done to the enemy, but that the enemy is fallen down, and we after them, but to little purpose.

1667-07-26 12:02   To the office, where Mr. Hater and I together all the morning about the perfecting of my abstract book of contracts and other things to my great content.

1667-07-25 20:30   Sir W. Batten, W. Pen, and myself, and Sir R. Ford, did meet in the garden to discourse about our prizes at Hull. It appears that Hogg is the veriest rogue, the most observable embezzler, that ever was known. This vexes us, and made us very free and plain with Sir W. Pen.

1667-07-24 20:50 r But he do say that people do complain of Sir Edward Spragg, that he hath not done extraordinary; and more of Sir W. Jenings, that he come up with his tamkins in his guns.

1667-07-24 20:40 r He do say, that this afternoon they did force our ships to retreat, but that now they are gone down as far as Shield-haven: but what the event hath been of this evening’s guns they know not.

1667-07-24 20:20 r I went up to the Ship and discoursed with the landlord of the house, who undeceives me in what I heard this morning about the Dutch having lost two men-of-war, for it is not so, but several of their fire-ships.

1667-07-24 19:30 r As we come nearer Gravesend, we hear the Dutch fleet and ours a-firing their guns most distinctly and loud. But before we got to Gravesend they ceased.

1667-07-24 18:55   I took a pair of oars, which I made a gally at Redriffe, and so with very much pleasure down to Gravesend, all the way with extraordinary content reading of Boyle’s Hydrostatickes, which the more I read and understand, the more I admire, as a most excellent piece of philosophy.

1667-07-24 07:10 r These fellows are mighty bold, and have had the fortune of the wind easterly this time to bring them up, and prevent our troubling them with our fire-ships; and, indeed, have had the winds at their command from the beginning.

1667-07-24 06:50 r Sir W. Batten tells me that we have burned one of their men-of-war, and another of theirs is blown up: but how true this is, I know not.

1667-07-24 06:04   Comes a letter from the Clerk of the Cheque at Gravesend, to tell me that the Dutch fleet did come all into the Hope yesterday noon, and held a fight with our ships from thence till seven at night; that they had burned twelve fire-ships, and burned five of our fire-ships.

1667-07-23 21:33 r Comes an order from White Hall to send down one of our number to Chatham, fearing that they may make a show first up hither, but then go to Chatham: so my Lord Bruncker do go, and we are to give notice to the men-of-war, gone below the barricado at Woolwich, to come up again.

1667-07-23 20:41 r Comes another letter from Captain Proud, that eight of them were come into the Hope, and thirty more following them, at ten this morning.

1667-07-23 20:20   Comes sudden news to me by letter from the Clerk of the Cheque at Gravesend, that there were thirty sail of Dutch men-of-war coming up into the Hope this last tide: which I told Sir W. Pen of; but he would not believe it, but laughed, and said it was a fleet of Billanders.

1667-07-22 15:00   Creed tells me of the fray between the Duke of Buckingham at the Duke’s playhouse and Henry Killigrew, whom the Duke of Buckingham did soundly beat and take away his sword, and make a fool of, till the fellow prayed him to spare his life.

1667-07-22 10:40 r Letters were read from Tangier that Guiland is wholly lost, and that he do offer Arzill to us to deliver it to us. But Sir W. Coventry did declare that we should have nothing to do with it, and said that if Tangier were offered us now, he would advise against the taking it.

1667-07-22 09:50 r The Duke of York, the Lord Chancellor, my Lord Duke of Albemarle, Arlington, Ashley, Peterborough, and Coventry, I perceive they do all profess their expectation of a peace, and do advise of things accordingly, and do all speak of it, saying that they hoped for it.

1667-07-22 09:15   To my Lord Chancellor’s, where was a Committee of Tangier in my Lord’s roome, where he is to hear causes, where all the judges’ pictures hang up, very fine.

1667-07-21 22:55 r Mercer tells me that the pretty maid of the Ship tavern I spoke of yesterday is married there, which I am glad of.

1667-07-21 22:20   I and my wife and Mercer up by water to Barne Elmes, where we walked by moonshine, and called at Lambeth, and drank and had cold meat in the boat, and did eat, and sang, very fine and pleasant, only could not sing ordinary songs with the freedom that otherwise I would.

1667-07-20 12:06 r In going by, to my content, I find that the very pretty daughter at the Ship tavern, at the end of Billiter Lane, is there still, and in the bar: and, I believe, is married to him that is new come, and hath new trimmed the house.

1667-07-20 12:02   Towards the ’Change, in my way observing my mistake yesterday in Mark Lane, that the woman I saw was not the pretty woman I meant, the line-maker’s wife, but a new-married woman, very pretty, a strong-water seller.

1667-07-19 21:38 r God knows whether they can do it any hurt, or no, but it was pretty news come the other day so fast, of the Dutch fleets being in so many places, that Sir W. Batten at table cried, “By God,” says he, “I think the Devil shits Dutchmen.”

1667-07-19 21:35 r The Dutch fleet are in great squadrons everywhere still about Harwich, and were lately at Portsmouth; and the last letters say at Plymouth, and now gone to Dartmouth to destroy our Straights’ fleet lately got in thither.

1667-07-19 21:30   One tells me that, by letter from Holland, the people there are made to believe that our condition in England is such as they may have whatever they will ask; and that so they are mighty high, and despise us, or a peace with us.

1667-07-19 11:38   Home, and in my way by coach down Marke Lane, mightily pleased and smitten to see, as I thought, in passing, the pretty woman, the line-maker’s wife that lived in Fenchurch Street, and I had great mind to have gone back to have seen but yet would correct my nature and would not.

1667-07-19 08:45   Up and comes the flageolet master, and brings me two new great Ivory pipes which cost me 32s., and so to play.

1667-07-18 20:12   Being weary, took out my wife and Will Batelier by coach to Islington, but no pleasure in our going, the way being so dusty that one durst not breathe.

1667-07-17 20:26 r Yet it is worth remembering what she says: that she hath heard both seamen and soldiers swear they would rather serve the Dutch than the King, for they should be better used.

1667-07-17 20:24   Home to supper, and there find my sister Michell come from Lee to see us; but do tattle so much of the late business of the Dutch coming thither that I was weary of it.

1667-07-17 12:00 r I at Sir W. Batten’s did hear the particulars of it; and there for joy he did give the company that were there a bottle or two of his own last year’s wine, growing at Walthamstow, then which the whole company said they never drank better foreign wine in their lives.

1667-07-17 11:15   Home, where I am saluted with the news of Hogg’s bringing a rich Canary prize to Hull: and Sir W. Batten do offer me 1000l. down for my particular share, beside Sir Richard Ford’s part, which do tempt me; but yet I would not take it, but will stand and fall with the company.

1667-07-17 09:32   To the Hall and talked with Mrs. Michell, who begins to tire me about doing something for her elder son, which I am willing to do, but know not what.

1667-07-16 11:58   In the morning I was able to put on a wide shoe on the foot, and to the office without much pain, and there sat all the morning.

1667-07-15 19:20   I rose and eat something, where our poor Jane very sad for the death of her poor brother, who hath left a wife and two small children. I did give her 20s. in money, and what wine she needed, for the burying him.

1667-07-15 09:32 r In great pain all night long so as I was not able to go to-day to wait on the Duke of York with my fellows, but was forced in bed to write the particulars for their discourse there.

1667-07-14 22:58 r My foot begins more and more to pain me, which Mrs. Turner, by keeping her warm hand upon it, did much ease; but so that when we come home I was not able to walk from the lane’s end to my house without being helped.

1667-07-14 21:15 r Mrs. Turner mightily pleased with my resolution, which, I tell her, is never to keep a country-house, but to keep a coach, and with my wife on the Saturday to go sometimes for a day to this place, and then quit to another place.

1667-07-14 20:30 r We set out for home, the sun by and by going down, and we in the cool of the evening all the way with much pleasure home, talking and pleasing ourselves with the pleasure of this day’s work.

1667-07-14 19:10 r Through Epsum towne to our inne, in the way stopping a poor woman with her milk-pail, and in one of my gilt tumblers did drink our bellyfulls of milk, better than any creame.

1667-07-14 17:32 r We took notice of his shoes shod with iron, both at the toe and heels, and with great nails in the soles of his feet: “Why,” says the man, “the downes are full of stones, and we are faine to shoe ourselves thus; and these will make the stones fly till they sing before me.”

1667-07-14 17:27 r I made the boy read to me, which he did, with the forced tone that children do usually read, that was mighty pretty, and then I did give him something, and went to the father, and talked with him; and I find he had been a servant in my cozen Pepys’s house.

1667-07-14 17:20 r The women and W. Hewer and I walked upon the Downes, where a flock of sheep was; and the most pleasant and innocent sight that ever I saw in my life — we find a shepherd and his little boy reading, far from any houses or sight of people, the Bible to him.

1667-07-14 16:04 r I, by leaping down the little bank, coming out of the wood, did sprain my right foot, which brought me great present pain, but presently, with walking, it went away for the present.

1667-07-14 15:38 r I carried them to see my cozen Pepys’s house, and ’light, and walked round about it, and they like it, as indeed it deserves, very well, and is a pretty place.

1667-07-14 13:20 r I to my women into a better room, which the people of the house borrowed for us, and there to dinner, a good dinner, and were merry, and Pendleton come to us, who happened to be in the house, and there talked and were merry.

1667-07-14 11:37 r Here I saw Gilsthrop, Sir W. Batten’s clerk that hath been long sick, he looks like a dying man, with a consumption got, as is believed, by the pox, but God knows that the man is in a sad condition, though he finds himself much better since his coming thither, he says.

1667-07-14 10:20 r We took coach again and to the towne, to the King’s Head, where our coachman carried us, and there had an ill room for us to go into, but the best in the house that was not taken up.

1667-07-14 08:50 r We got to Epsum, to the well; where much company, and there we ’light, and I drank the water: they did not, but do go about and walk a little among the women, but I did drink four pints, and had some very good stools by it.

1667-07-14 05:30 r My wife ready; and, taking some bottles of wine, and beer, and some cold fowle with us into the coach, we took coach and four horses, which I had provided last night, and so away.

1667-07-14 05:10   Up, and my wife, a little before four, and to make us ready; and by and by Mrs. Turner come to us, by agreement, and she and I staid talking below, while my wife dressed herself, which vexed me that she was so long about it keeping us till past five o’clock before she was ready.

1667-07-13 22:15   So home, and resolved upon going to Epsum tomorrow, only for ayre, and got Mrs. Turner to go with us, and so home and to supper (after having been at the office) and to bed.

1667-07-13 13:33   Mr. Pierce dined with us, who tells us what troubles me, that my Lord Buckhurst hath got Nell away from the King’s house, lies with her, and gives her 100l. a year, so as she hath sent her parts to the house, and will act no more.

1667-07-13 10:41   My Lord Anglesey, this being the second time of his being with us, did take me aside and asked me where I lived, because he would be glad to have some discourse with me.

1667-07-13 06:40   Up pretty betimes, it being mighty hot weather, I lying this night, which I have not done, I believe, since a boy, I am sure not since I had the stone before, with only a rugg and a sheet upon me.

1667-07-12 14:52 r Insomuch, that I going to the office to avoid further anger, she followed me in a devilish manner thither, and with much ado I got her into the garden out of hearing, to prevent shame.

1667-07-12 14:47   Home, and there find my wife in a dogged humour for my not dining at home, and I did give her a pull by the nose and some ill words, which she provoked me to by something she spoke, that we fell extraordinarily out.

1667-07-12 14:15   Sir Thomas Crew and I alone, and he tells me how I am mightily in esteem with the Parliament; there being harangues made in the House to the Speaker, of Mr. Pepys’s readiness and civility to show them every thing, which I am at this time very glad of.

1667-07-12 11:02 r It is strange how every body do now-a-days reflect upon Oliver, and commend him, what brave things he did, and made all the neighbour princes fear him; while here a prince, come in with all the love of his people, hath lost all so soon.

1667-07-12 10:50 r Sir H. Cholmly do decry the King’s expenses of his Privy-purse, which in King James’s time did not rise to above 5000l. a year, and in King Charles’s to 10,000l., do now cost us above 100,000l., besides the great charge of the monarchy, as the Duke of York 100,000l. of it.

1667-07-12 10:48   While we were at the Excise office, it was computed that the Parliament had given the King for this war, besides all prizes, and besides the 200,000l. which he was to spend of his own revenue, to guard the sea above 5,000,000l. and odd 100,000l.; which is a most prodigious sum.

1667-07-12 08:32   To my chamber, there doing business, and by and by comes Greeting and begun a new month with him, and now to learn to set anything from the notes upon the flageolet, but, Lord! to see how like a fool he goes about to give me direction would make a man mad.

1667-07-11 22:10   To bed, in hopes to have all things in my office in good condition in a little time for any body to examine, which I am sure none else will.

1667-07-11 10:30   Sir T. Harvy tells me that the Council last night did sit close to determine of the King’s answer about the peace, and that though he do not certainly know, yet by all discourse yesterday he do believe it is peace.

1667-07-10 21:21   This day our girl Mary, whom Payne helped us to, did go away declaring that she must be where she might earn something one day, and spend it and play away the next. But a good civil wench, and one neither wife nor I did ever give angry word to, but she has this silly vanity.

1667-07-10 10:41   The Duke of York is come back last night from Harwich, the news he brings I know not, nor hear anything today from Dover, whether the enemy have made any attempt there as was expected.

1667-07-09 19:40   News comes for certain that the Dutch are with their fleet before Dover, and that it is expected they will attempt something there. The business of the peace is quite dashed again.

1667-07-09 09:20   Up pretty betimes and to the office, where busy till office time, and then we sat, but nothing to do but receive clamours about money.

1667-07-08 21:15   All the world being as I hear very much damped that their hopes of peace is become uncertain again.

1667-07-08 11:36 r I tried to weigh them in my arms, and find them twice as heavy as people almost twice their age; and yet I am apt to believe they are very young. If, as my Lord Ormond certifies, it be true that they are no older, it is very monstrous.

1667-07-08 11:30   To Charing Cross, there to see the great boy and girle that are lately come out of Ireland, the latter eight, the former but four years old, of most prodigious bigness for their age.

1667-07-08 10:10   Mr. Coventry is come from Bredah but brings with him articles which do not please the King: to retrench the Act of Navigation; to ascertain what are contraband goods; and that those exiled persons, who shall take refuge in their country, may be secure from further prosecution.

1667-07-08 09:02   Home, and there heard Mr. Caesar play some very good things on the lute together with myself on the violl and Greeting on the viallin.

1667-07-07 21:22 r Above all, my wife and I were the most surprised in the beauty of a plain girle, which we met in the little lane going from Redriffe-stairs into the fields, one of the prettiest faces that we think we ever saw in our lives.

1667-07-07 21:04   With my wife and Jane over to Half-way house, a very good walk; and there drank, and in the cool of the evening back again, and sang with pleasure upon the water, and were mightily pleased in hearing a boatfull of Spaniards sing.

1667-07-06 17:17 r He pulled her into a stable by the Dog tavern, and there did tumble her and toss her, calling him all the rogues and toads in the world, when she knows that elle hath suffered me to do any thing with her a hundred times.

1667-07-06 17:15 r Here happened the best instance of a woman’s falseness in the world, that her sister Doll, who went for a bottle of wine, did come home all blubbering and swearing against one Captain Vandener, a Dutchman of the Rhenish Wine House.

1667-07-06 16:38   To Mrs. Martin’s, where I met with the good news que esta no es con child, the fear of which she did give me the other day, had troubled me much. My joy in this made me send for wine, and thither come her sister and Mrs. Cragg, and I staid a good while there.

1667-07-06 12:04   Creed come to dine with us and brings the first word I hear of the news of a peace, the King having letters come to him this noon signifying that it is concluded on, and that Mr. Coventry is upon his way coming over for the King’s satisfaction.

1667-07-05 21:21   No news, but that the Dutch are gone clear from Harwich northward, and have given out they are going to Yarmouth.

1667-07-05 16:38   I am vexed to hear that Nan Wright, now Mrs. Markham, Sir W. Pen’s maid and whore, is come to sit in our pew at church, and did so while my Lady Batten was there. I confess I am very much vexed at it and ashamed.

1667-07-04 11:27 r Well, this fellow Holmes was found guilty of the act of burning the house, and other things, that he stood indicted for. The judge seems to be a worthy man, and able: and do intend, for these rogues that burned this house to be hung in some conspicuous place in the town.

1667-07-04 10:55 r But the impudence of this fellow was such, that he denied he ever saw the boys before, or ever knew the Russia House, or that the people knew him; and by and by the mistress of the Russia House was called in, being indicted.

1667-07-04 10:36 r These two boys were playing, and one rogue, Holmes, did come to them and teach them to drink, and then to bring him plate and clothes from their fathers’ houses, and carry him into their houses, and leaving open the doors for him, and at last were made of their conspiracy.

1667-07-04 10:10 r They proved against several, their consulting several times at a bawdy-house in Moore-Fields, called the Russia House, among many other rogueries, of setting houses on fire, that they might gather the goods that were flung into the streets.

1667-07-04 09:40 r Here were several trials; among others several brought in for making it their trade to set houses on fire to get plunder; and all proved by the two little boys spoken of yesterday by Sir R. Ford, who did give so good account of particulars that I never heard children in my life.

1667-07-04 09:05   I took coach and to the Sessions-house, where I have a mind to hear Bazill Fielding’s case tried; and so got up to the Bench, my Lord Chief-Justice Keeling being Judge.

1667-07-03 19:32 r She swears that the child is mine, which I do not believe, but yet do comfort her that either it cannot be so, or if it be that I will take care to send for her husband, though I do hardly see how I can be sure of that, the ship being at sea, and as far as Scotland.

1667-07-03 19:28   I to Mrs. Martin’s, but when I come, contrary to my expectation, I find her all in trouble, and what was it for but that I have got her with child for those do not venir upon her as they should have done; and is in exceeding grief.

1667-07-03 17:20 r Here I find all the news is the enemy’s landing 3,000 men near Harwich, and attacking Landguard Fort, and being beat off thence with our great guns, killing some of their men, and they leaving their ladders behind them.

1667-07-03 15:10   By water to White Hall, and there to the Council-chamber, to deliver a letter to their Lordships about the state of the six merchantmen which we have been so long fitting out.

1667-07-03 13:18 r And that one house they did set on fire in Aldersgate Street last Easter; and that this is proved by two young men, whom one of them debauched by degrees to steal their fathers’ plate and clothes, and at last to be of their company.

1667-07-03 13:15   I to Sir W. Batten’s and dined, and there comes in Sir Richard Ford, tells us how he hath been at the Sessions-house, and there it is plain that there is a combination of rogues in the town, that do make it their business to set houses on fire.

1667-07-02 21:21   Mrs. Turner tells me how she hears at the other end of the town how bad our office is spoken of by the King and Prince and Duke of Albemarle, and that there is not a good word said of any of us but of me; and me they all do speak mightily of, which I am mighty glad to hear.

1667-07-02 14:46   My wife and Jane (mighty fine the girle) to go to see Jane’s old mistress, who was to see her, and did see my wife the other day, and it is pleasant to hear with what kindness her old mistress speaks of this girl, and how she would still have her.

1667-07-02 10:22   Every thing stands still for money, while we want money to pay for some of the most necessary things that we promised ready money for in the height of our wants, as grapnells, &c.

1667-07-01 18:09   To the office, and did write to my Lord Bruncker to give me a little satisfaction about the certainty of the chain’s being broke, which I begin to doubt, and the more from Sir W. Pen’s discourse.

1667-07-01 14:34 r Home by noon, where all well, and then to dinner, and after dinner both of us laid down upon the couch and chairs and to sleep, which I did for an hour or two, and then to the office, where I am sorry to hear that Sir J. Minnes is likely to die this night.

1667-07-01 10:32 r To one Goody Best’s, a little out of the town towards London road, and thither we went with the coach, and find it a mighty clean, plain house, and had a dish of very good cream to our liking, and so away presently very merry.

1667-07-01 10:02 r We did hear a plain fellow cry out upon the folly of the King’s officers above, to spend so much money in works at Woolwich and Deptford, and sinking of good ships loaden with goods, when, if half the charge had been laid out here, it would have secured all that before now.

1667-07-01 09:40   We took coach, and, being very sleepy, droused most part of the way to Gravesend, and there ’light, and down to the new batterys, which are like to be very fine.

1667-07-01 08:58   Up betimes, waked by a damned noise between a sow gelder and a cow and a dog, nobody after we were up being able to tell us what it was.
