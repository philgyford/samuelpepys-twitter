1663-04-30 13:28   I never could have thought there had been upon earth a man so little curious in the world as Stankes is.

1663-04-30 13:24   What a stir Stankes makes with being wearied in walking in London. He would not be wooed to go to a play, to White Hall, or to the lyons.

1663-04-29 18:10   My father’s bowells went up again into his belly, being got forth into his cod, as it seems is usual with very many men.

1663-04-29 17:50   It being a rupture which my father is troubled, and has been this 20 years, but never in half the pain and with so great swelling as now.

1663-04-29 17:45   At last we got home, and all helping my father we got him to bed presently.

1663-04-29 17:14   In St. Paul’s Churchyard, we were forced to stay, the jogging and pain making my father vomit, which it never had done before.

1663-04-29 16:39   I got my father to go to the coach, with great pain, and driving hard, he all the while in a most unsufferable torment.

1663-04-29 16:10   Back to my father, who I found in such pain that I could not bear the sight of it without weeping.

1663-04-29 15:51   I found my father unexpectedly in great pain and desiring for God’s sake to get him a bed, in so great pain as I never saw, poor wretch.

1663-04-29 12:28   We sat down and very merry talking, and mightily extolling the manner of my Lord’s retirement, and the goodness of his diet.

1663-04-29 12:03   To Chelsey, where we found my Lord all alone at a little table with one joynt of meat at dinner.

1663-04-28 10:44   Stepped up to see my wife and her dancing master at it, and I think after all she will do pretty well at it.

1663-04-27 18:36   Home, where I found Mary gone from my wife, she being too high for her, though a good servant, and my boy too will be going in a few days.

1663-04-27 09:24   Captain Browne is dead of a blow given him two days ago by a seaman, being drunk, with a stone striking him on the forehead.

1663-04-26 20:15   Gathering of cowslipps, and so to Half-way house, with some cold lamb we carried with us, and there supped, and had a pleasant walk back.

1663-04-26 18:24   My wife, Ashwell, and the boy and I, and the dogg, over the water and walked to Half-way house, and beyond into the fields.

1663-04-26 16:48   All the afternoon upon my accounts, and find myself worth full 700l, for which I bless God, it being the most I was ever yet worth in money.

1663-04-26 11:07   A very good sermon of a country minister upon “How blessed a thing it is for brethren to live together in unity!”

1663-04-25 21:23   So to bed.

1663-04-25 20:46   I fear my wife will hardly do any great good at dancing, because she is conceited that she do well already, though I think no such thing.

1663-04-25 20:44   Merrily practising to dance, which my wife hath begun to learn this day of Mr. Pembleton.

1663-04-25 15:27   The Queen is grieved at the King’s neglecting her, he having not supped with her this quarter of a year, every night with Lady Castlemaine.

1663-04-24 17:49   All the afternoon fiddling upon my viallin while Ashwell danced above in my upper best chamber, which is a rare room for musique.

1663-04-24 14:36   Sending my boy to enquire after two dancing masters at our end of the town for my wife to learn, of whose names the boy brought word.

1663-04-24 12:45   It seems Captain Holland is turned almost a Quaker, his discourse being nothing but holy, and that impertinent, that I was weary of him.

1663-04-24 12:16   Captain Holland has been harassed about the ship he has bought. It seems in a despair he endeavoured to cut his own throat but is recovered.

1663-04-24 05:51   Yet for all I am afeard it will make the boy never the better, he is grown so hardened in his tricks, which I am sorry for.

1663-04-24 05:48   With my salt eel went down in the parler and there got my boy and did beat him till I was fain to take breath two or three times.

1663-04-23 21:44   My boy being sent for some mustard, the rogue staid half an hour in the streets at a bonfire, at which I was angry, and resolve to beat him.

1663-04-23 10:48   I did tell my father how things stand, and did shew my distrust of Pall, both for her good nature and housewifery, which he was sorry for.

1663-04-23 10:32   I find my father’s spending has been at 100l. per annum, which troubles me, and I did let him apprehend it, so as that the poor man wept.

1663-04-23 10:30   With my father, we sat looking over his country accounts ever since his going into the country.

1663-04-22 21:56   Home, where my father (who is so very melancholy) and we played at cards, and so to supper and to bed.

1663-04-22 17:27   To the King’s Playhouse, where we saw but part of “Witt without mony,” which I do not like much, but coming late put me out of tune.

1663-04-21 20:46   Ashwell plays well at cards, and will teach us to play; I wish it do not lose too much of my time, and put my wife too much upon it.

1663-04-21 07:06   To my office, where first I ruled with red ink my English “Mare Clausum,” which, with the new orthodox title, makes it now very handsome.

1663-04-20 21:13   Troubled at Ashwell’s desiring and insisting over eagerly upon her going to a ball to meet some of her old companions at a dancing school.

1663-04-20 14:47   To my Lord Treasurer’s, thinking to have spoken about getting money for paying the Yards; but we found him with some ladies at cards.

1663-04-20 12:07   There being the prints of most of the greatest houses, churches, and antiquitys in Italy and France and brave cutts.

1663-04-20 12:05   To Mr. Grant’s. There saw his prints, which he shewed me, and indeed are the best collection of any things almost that ever I saw.

1663-04-19 20:14   Fell in discourse of dancing, and I find that Ashwell hath a fine carriage, which makes my wife almost ashamed to see herself so outdone.

1663-04-19 06:10   Put on my close-kneed coloured suit, which, with new stockings of the colour, with belt, and new gilt-handled sword, is very handsome.

1663-04-18 16:27   Walking in the garden, Mr. Creed and I talking of the ill management of our office, which God knows is very ill for the King’s advantage.

1663-04-18 12:03   Mr. Creed has been engaged at the office about the ending of his accounts, wherein he is most unhappy to have to do with a company of fools.

1663-04-17 13:20   Our dinner was only sugarsopps and fish; the only time that we have had a Lenten dinner all this Lent.

1663-04-17 09:12   I am under a doubt whether I had best buy a Basse Viall yet or no, because of spoiling my present mind and love to business.

1663-04-17 09:07   Mr. Hunt, the instrument maker, brought me home a Basse Viall to see whether I like it, which I do not very well.

1663-04-16 07:36   I dare not oppose it alone for making an enemy and do no good, but God knows it troubles my heart to see it.

1663-04-16 07:28   We met to pass Mr. Pitt’s accounts for the voyage last to the Streights, wherein the demands are strangely irregular.

1663-04-15 16:07   I walked back again, all the way reading of my book of Timber measure, comparing it with my new Sliding Rule with great pleasure.

1663-04-15 14:22   I to Deptford by land about looking out a couple of catches fitted to be speedily set forth in answer to a letter of Mr. Coventry’s to me.

1663-04-14 20:24   Sir G. Carteret tells me that he perceives the Parliament is likely to make a great bustle before they will give the King any money.

1663-04-14 08:04   Sir W. Batten, Sir J. Minnes, Sir W. Pen and I down by barge to Woolwich to see “The Royal James” launched, where she has been under repair.

1663-04-13 16:06   We fell to my Lord Rutherford’s dispatch, which do not please him, he being a Scott, and one resolved to scrape every penny that he can get.

1663-04-13 12:49   With Sir W. Batten to the Stillyard, and there eat a lobster, and Wyse the King’s fishmonger coming in we were very merry half an hour.

1663-04-12 18:49   A drunken boy was carrying by our constable to our new pair of stocks to handsel them, being a new pair and very handsome.

1663-04-12 11:20   To church, where I found our pew altered by taking some of the hind pew to make ours bigger, because of the number of women.

1663-04-11 13:59   After dinner in comes Captain Lambert of the Norwich, this day come from Tangier, whom I am glad to see.

1663-04-10 15:40   Walked to the New Exchange. There laid out 10s. upon pendents and painted leather gloves, very pretty and all the mode.

1663-04-10 12:45   Drank a sort of French wine, called Ho Bryan, that hath a good and most particular taste that I never met with.

1663-04-10 12:10   After expectation from Ireland, and long stop of letters, there is good news, that all is quiett after our great noise of troubles there.

1663-04-09 21:49   My father lying at Tom’s to-night, he dining with my uncle Fenner and his sons and a great many more of the gang at his own cost to-day.

1663-04-09 12:22   Our maid Mary do endeavour to corrupt our cook maid, which did please me well, but I am resolved to rid the house of her as soon as I can.

1663-04-08 16:05   Turning into the park to show my father the steps up the hill, we found my wife, her woman, and dog, which made us all merry again.

1663-04-08 15:50   I took my father on board the King’s pleasure boat and down to Woolwich, and walked to Greenwich.

1663-04-08 14:42   We immediately returned, I taking another boat and with my father went to Woolwich, while they went back to find the dog.

1663-04-08 14:25   God knows whether our dog be not lost, which did not only strike my wife into a great passion but I must confess myself also.

1663-04-08 14:20   By water towards Woolwich, and in our way I bethought myself that we had left our little dog that followed us out of doors at the waterside.

1663-04-08 08:16   To Commissioner Pett and discoursed about the affairs of our office, how ill they go through the folly of Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes.

1663-04-07 13:07   My wife could not get Ashwell to have it drawn after the first twich, but would let it alone, and so they came home with it undone.

1663-04-07 13:04   Home to dinner, where I found my wife had been with Ashwell to La Roche’s to have her tooth drawn, which it seems aches much.

1663-04-06 17:32   I told Mr. Coventry my mind concerning matters of our office, all my discontent to see things of so great trust carried so neglectfully.

1663-04-06 15:07   I to the Committee of Tangier, where I found, to my great joy, my Lord Sandwich, the first time I have seen him abroad these some months.

1663-04-05 19:45   Home to my office alone till dark, reading some papers of my old navy precedents.

1663-04-05 11:27   Spent the morning in reading part of Osborne’s Advice to his Son (which I shall not never enough admire for sense and language).

1663-04-04 17:58   We home and found the house as clean as if nothing had been done there to-day, which made us give the cook 12d. a piece, each of us.

1663-04-04 16:22   At the Park was the King, and in another coach my Lady Castlemaine, they greeting one another at every tour.

1663-04-04 15:06   To Hide Park; my aunt, Mrs Wight and I in one coach, and the rest of the women in Mrs Turner’s; Roger being gone in haste to the Parliament.

1663-04-04 14:30   …a dish of roasted pigeons, a dish of four lobsters, three tarts, a lamprey pie (a rare pie), a dish of anchovies, wine of several sorts.

1663-04-04 14:29   We had a fricasee of rabbits and chickens, a leg of mutton boiled, three carps in a dish, a great dish of a side of lamb,…

1663-04-04 12:34   This being my feast, in lieu of what I should have had a few days ago for my cutting of the stone, for which the Lord make me thankful.

1663-04-04 12:32   Comes Roger Pepys, Mrs. Turner her daughter, Joyce Norton, and a daughter of Coll. Cockes, my uncle Wight, his wife and Mrs. Anne Wight.

1663-04-03 21:07   I hear that there is an embargo upon our ships in Spayne, upon this action of my Lord Windsor’s at Cuba, which signifies little or nothing.

1663-04-03 20:22   I find at Court that there is some bad news from Ireland of an insurrection of the Catholiques there, which puts them into an alarm.

1663-04-03 12:52   I found that Ashwell has very good principles of musique and can take out a lesson herself with very little pains, at which I am very glad.

1663-04-03 12:10   I broke the letter open, not looking till all the money was out, that I might say I saw no money in the paper, if I should be questioned.

1663-04-03 11:42   I met Captain Grove, who did give me a letter directed to myself from himself. I discerned money to be in it, and took it.

1663-04-03 11:06   Dr. Creeton, the Scotchman, preached a most admirable, good, learned, honest and most severe sermon, yet comicall.

1663-04-02 11:49   The King hath sent to the House his concurrence wholly with them against the Popish priests, Jesuits, &c, which gives great content.

1663-04-02 11:02   Sir W. Pen did speak about my wife’s strangeness to him, and believing it was from his taking of Sarah to be his maid, he hath put her away.

1663-04-02 05:03   Up by very betimes and to my office.

1663-04-01 21:45   Vexed in my mind to see things ordered so unlike gentlemen, or men of reason, I went home and to bed.

1663-04-01 21:22   Lord! how Sir J. Minnes, like a mad coxcomb, did swear and stamp, swearing that Commissioner Pett hath still the old heart against the King.

1663-04-01 21:07   I hear that Commissioner Pett’s Stempeese for the new ship at Woolwich, which we have been so long, do prove knotty and not fit for service.

1663-04-01 13:07   Ashwell and I dined below, and a pretty girl she is, and I hope will give my wife and myself good content, being very humble and active.

1663-04-01 10:52   I calling on the virginall maker, buying a rest to tune my tryangle, and taking one of his people along with me to put it in tune once more.

1663-04-01 08:40   My father tells me how unquiett my mother is grown, that he is not able to live almost with her, if it were not for Pall.

1663-04-01 07:20   To my Cozen Roger Pepys, to see and talk with him a little; who tells me that, with much ado, the Parliament do agree to throw down Popery.
