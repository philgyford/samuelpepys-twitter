1663-11-30 22:02   I spent the evening with my wife in arithmetique, and so to supper and to bed.

1663-11-30 18:32   Methinks my Lord is not well pleased, nor will be a good while. I hope all will over in time, or else I am ill rewarded for my good service.

1663-11-30 17:07   Home, calling upon my bookseller’s for two books, Rushworth’s and Scobell’s Collections. I shall make the King pay for them.

1663-11-29 21:47   To my office all the evening making up my accounts, and blessed be God I have got up my crumb again to 770l, the most that ever I had yet.

1663-11-29 13:42   A good dinner we had of boeuf a la mode, but not roasted so well as my wife used to do it.

1663-11-29 11:10   I to church alone, my wife not going, and I found my Lady Batten in a velvet gown, which vexed me that she should be in it before my wife.

1663-11-29 07:03   I put on my best black cloth suit, trimmed with scarlett ribbon, very neat, with my cloake lined with velvett, and a new beaver.

1663-11-28 20:44   One way is with his pockets turned the wrong side outward, hanging out empty; another leading of two ladies, while others abuse him.

1663-11-28 20:43   I have been told two or three times, but to-day for certain I am told how in Holland publickly they have pictured our King with reproach.

1663-11-28 15:21   To Paul’s Church Yard, and there looked upon the second part of Hudibras, which I buy not, but borrow, to see if it be as good as the first.

1663-11-28 13:06   Mr. Pierce tells me my Lord Sandwich is resolved to go no more to Chelsy, and told me he believed that I had been giving my Lord counsel.

1663-11-27 13:44   It makes good sport that my mayde Jane dares not go to France, and Besse is wild to go, and is mad for joy.

1663-11-27 13:42   My wife pleased with my discourse of getting a trip over to Calais, or some other port of France, the next summer, in one of the yachts.

1663-11-27 12:04   Up and to my office, where busy with great delight all the morning.

1663-11-26 22:24   To bed – myself being in a little pain in one of my testicles, by a stroke I did give it in pulling up my breeches yesterday over-eagerly.

1663-11-26 10:22   The plague grows at Amsterdam; we are going upon making all ships coming from thence and Hambrough to perform their Quarantine in Holehaven.

1663-11-25 22:10   Home to supper and to bed, my mind in good ease all but my health, of which I am not a little doubtful.

1663-11-25 19:08   Sir W. Warren advised me in things I desired about bummary and other ways of putting out money as in parts of ships, how dangerous they are.

1663-11-25 08:58   This was sudden and extraordinary and do please me mightily, and I am resolved by no means ever to lose Sir G. Carteret again if I can.

1663-11-25 08:55   Sir G. Carteret desires that we may tell one another any thing that passes among us wherein we are either dissatisfied one with another.

1663-11-24 22:13   So home to supper and to bed, being troubled to find myself so bound as I am, notwithstanding all the physic that I take.

1663-11-24 13:47   We opened Mr. Deane’s draught of a ship which he has made for me, and indeed it is a most excellent one.

1663-11-23 17:32   With Alderman Backewell talking of the new money, which he says will never be counterfeited; but it is deadly inconvenient for telling.

1663-11-23 14:10   My fears do grow that my Lord will not reform as I hoped he would nor have the ingenuity to take my advice as he ought kindly.

1663-11-22 13:41   To the King’s Head ordinary, and there dined, good company: most of their discourse was about hunting in a dialect I understand very little.

1663-11-22 09:26   I rather think that my Lord’s mind was somewhat eased, and hope that he will be to me as he was before.

1663-11-22 09:07   I think I may have done myself an injury for my Lord’s good, which, were it to do again, I think I should sit without taking notice of it.

1663-11-22 08:42   My Lord begun, with a very serious countenance, to tell me that he had received my late letter, wherein he took notice of my care of him.

1663-11-22 08:15   Having last night bespoke a coach, which failed me this morning, I walked as far as the Temple, and there took coach, and to my Lord’s.

1663-11-21 15:32   To Ludgate and, by pricing several there, I guess this gowne may be worth about 12l. or 15l. But I expect at least 50l. of Mr. Creed.

1663-11-21 12:12   I confess I had expectations of a better account from Mr. Creed of my service about his accounts.

1663-11-21 12:10   I receive a letter from Mr. Creed, with a token, viz., a very noble parti-coloured Indian gowne for my wife.

1663-11-20 22:13   Having been late at the office looking over plates of the Northern seas, the White seas, and Archangell river, I went home, and to bed.

1663-11-20 18:14   A great talke there is today of a crush between the Fanatiques up in arms, and the King’s men in the North; but whether true I know not yet.

1663-11-20 13:32   To the Exchange, and there met by agreement Mr. Howe, and took him with a barrel of oysters home to dinner, where we were very merry.

1663-11-20 09:42   I went up to Mr. Howe, who I saw this day the first time in a periwigg, which becomes him very well, and discoursed with him.

1663-11-20 08:48   To my Lord Sandwich’s lodgings, but he was gone out before, and so I am defeated of my expectation of being eased one way or other.

1663-11-19 17:42   Mr. Moore believes my letter to my Lord Sandwich hath wrought well upon him, and that he will look after himself and his business upon it.

1663-11-19 15:22   Sir G. Carteret told me there is no such thing likely yet as a Dutch war, neither they nor we being in condition for it.

1663-11-18 21:57   Came Mr. Hollyard so full of discourse and Latin that I think he hath got a cupp; full of talke he is in defence of Calvin and Luther.

1663-11-18 12:43   Captain Berkeley, who was lately come from Algier, did give us a good account of the place, and how the Basha there do live like a prisoner.

1663-11-18 09:13   I sent Will with my great letter of reproof to my Lord Sandwich, who did give it into his owne hand. I pray God give a blessing to it.

1663-11-17 19:56   He tells me that I must drink now and then ale with my wine, and eat bread and butter and honey, and rye bread if I can endure it.

1663-11-17 19:54   Mr. Hollyard tells me again that I must eat in a morning some loosening gruel, and at night roasted apples.

1663-11-17 19:32   My mind and my wife’s is much eased, for I confess I should have been troubled to have had her cut, I could not have borne to have seen it.

1663-11-17 19:25   He believes a fomentation will do, and what her mayd will be able to do without knowing what it is for, only that it may be for the piles.

1663-11-17 19:20   Mr Hollyard and I to look upon my wife’s parts. He do find that, though it would not be much pain, the thing will be painful in the tending.

1663-11-17 18:38   Mr. Moore do conclude the letter well drawn, assuring me in the best of his judgment that it cannot but endear me to my Lord.

1663-11-17 18:32   I read to Mr. Moore the letter I have wrote to send to my Lord to give him an account how the world do talk of him and his living.

1663-11-17 12:07   I to the office, where we sat all the forenoon doing several businesses.

1663-11-16 20:07   Mr. Hollyard must be forced to cut it open all along, and which my heart I doubt will not serve for me to see done.

1663-11-16 19:52   It seems my wife’s great conflux of humours, that did use to swell there, did in breaking leave a hollow which has since gone in further.

1663-11-16 19:34   Mr. Hollyard came, and he and I about our great work to look upon my wife’s malady, which he did.

1663-11-15 15:20   To my office and drew up a letter to my Lord stating to him what the world talks concerning him. I wait Mr. Moore’s advice about sending it.

1663-11-14 22:24   This night I think is the first that I have lain without ever a man in my house besides myself, since I came to keep any.

1663-11-14 16:45   I hear that my boy Waynman has behaved himself so with Mr. Davis that they have got him put into a Barbadoes ship to be sent away.

1663-11-14 13:24   I bid “God bless him,” and left Will to remove his things, the poor lad weeping, but I think matters will be the better both for him and us.

1663-11-14 13:22   Before my wife I did give Will good counsel, and that his going should not abate my kindnesse for him, if he carried himself well.

1663-11-13 19:48   Home to my wife to take a clyster, and it wrought very well and brought a great deal of wind, which I perceive is all that do trouble me.

1663-11-13 16:03   I to my office, and put on my new shagg purple gowne, with gold buttons and loop lace, I being a little fearful of taking cold.

1663-11-13 14:20   After dinner came my perriwigg-maker, and brings me a second periwigg, made of my own haire, which comes to 21s. 6d.

1663-11-12 14:10   My Lord spends his time either at cards at Court with the ladies, when he is there at all, or else at Chelsy with the slut to his disgrace.

1663-11-12 12:03   To the office, where Sir W. Pen, like a coxcomb, was so ready to cross me in a motion, wherein I was vexed to see his spleene.

1663-11-11 13:32   Dr. Allen tells me that something made of gold, a grain of it put into a silver spoon and fired, will give a blow like a musquett.

1663-11-11 13:10   Among other things, I telling Dr. Allen what Dribble the German Doctor do offer of an instrument to sink ships.

1663-11-11 12:52   To the Coffee-house, where with Dr. Allen some good discourse about physique and chymistry.

1663-11-10 22:49   To the office and there late setting down yesterday’s remarkable discourses, and so home and to supper, late, and to bed.

1663-11-10 17:20   The Queene, I hear, is now very well again, and that she hath bespoke herself a new gowne.

1663-11-10 13:34   To the Exchange, where spoke with several and had my head casting about how to get a penny and I hope I shall.

1663-11-09 21:32   Mr. Blackburne told me Sir W. Pen was always a conceited man, but that it was his pretence of sanctity that brought him into play.

1663-11-09 11:13   The King is now besotted upon Mrs. Stewart, that he will be with her half an houre together kissing her to the observation of all the world.

1663-11-09 10:54   Mr. Pierce, chyrurgeon, told me how loose the Court is, nobody looking after business, but every man his lust and gain.

1663-11-09 09:10   To the Duke, where, when we came into his closett, he told us that Mr. Pepys was so altered with his new perriwigg that he did not know him.

1663-11-08 22:14   I spent most of the evening upon Fuller’s “Church History” and Barckly’s “Argeny,” and so after supper to prayers and to bed.

1663-11-08 11:06   I found that my coming to church in a perriwigg did not prove so strange to the world as I was afear’d it would.

1663-11-07 16:24   Consulted Dr. Turner about differences we have with the officers of the East India ships about goods brought by them without paying freight.

1663-11-07 14:30   To Westminster Hall, where, seeing Howlett’s daughter, I followed her and dallied with her a little, but I could not overtake her.

1663-11-07 08:42   Captain Taylor brought me a piece of plate, a state dish, he expecting that I should get him allowance for demorage of his ship “William.”

1663-11-06 18:09   But Mrs. Stewart proves a cunning slut, and is advised by the Queene-Mother, and by her mother, and so all the plot is spoiled.

1663-11-06 18:07   My Lord tells me he and Sir H. Bennet, the Duke of Buckingham and Duchesse, was of a committee for the getting of Mrs. Stewart for the King.

1663-11-06 14:24   I to White Hall, where Sir G. Carteret and my Lord met me fortunately, and wondered first to see me in my perruque and I am glad it is over.

1663-11-06 11:02   Sir John Cutler says that in time of thunder barrels of beer as have a piece of iron laid upon them will not be soured, and the others will.

1663-11-06 06:52   My wife was mighty-earnest to persuade me that she should prove with child since last night, which, if it be, let it come, and welcome.

1663-11-05 20:44   Mr. Shales and I discourse the discovery of arrears of provisions at Portsmouth, out of which I may get some money, and save the King some.

1663-11-05 13:05   By agreement to the Miter to dinner. Here was a very poor dinner and great company.

1663-11-04 21:48   To my office late, and among other things wrote a letter to Will’s uncle to hasten his removal from me.

1663-11-04 14:06   My wife is this day also herself making of marmalett of quince, which she now do very well herself.

1663-11-04 08:57   To my office, shewing myself to Sir W. Batten, and Sir J. Minnes, and no great matter made of my periwigg, as I was afeard there would be.

1663-11-03 20:20   Sir W. Pen observed mightily, and discoursed upon my cutting off my haire, but I perceive after a day or two it will be no great matter.

1663-11-03 16:14   I caused all my mayds to look upon my periwigg; they conclude it do become me; though Jane was troubled for my parting of my own haire.

1663-11-03 15:42   My periwigg on, I paid Chapman 3l. for it; and away went he with my owne haire to make up another of.

1663-11-03 15:11   Comes Chapman, the periwigg-maker, and upon my liking it, he cut off my haire, which went a little to my heart at present to part with it.

1663-11-03 12:47   To the Coffee-house, and there heard a long and most passionate discourse between two doctors of physique.

1663-11-03 00:05   I tempered myself well, so that being willing myself to peace, we did before we sleep become very good friends.

1663-11-02 23:16   My wife calling me perfidious and man of no conscience, whatever I pretend to, and I know not what, which troubled me mightily.

1663-11-02 22:58   My wife thought she had taken Jane in a lie, she told me of it triumphantly, but I, not seeing reason to conclude it a lie, was vexed.

1663-11-02 20:55   By coach and carried Mrs. Hunt home, and did give her a box of sugar and a haunch of venison given me by my Lady the other day.

1663-11-02 13:27   After a good dinner left Mrs. Hunt and my wife making marmalett of quinces, and Creed and I to the perriwigg makers.

1663-11-02 10:12   I heard the Duke say that he was going to wear a perriwigg; the King also will. I never till this day observed that the King is mighty gray.

1663-11-01 12:52   To church with my wife, and at noon dined at home alone, a good calf’s head boiled and dumplings, an excellent dinner methought it was.

1663-11-01 09:25   He brought me also my new gowne of purple shagg, trimmed with gold, very handsome; and a velvet hat, very fine to ride in, and the fashion.

1663-11-01 09:22   My brother’s man brought me a new baize waistecoate, faced with silke, which I put on from this day, laying by half-shirts for this winter.
