1663-03-31 14:07   Home to dinner, where W. Joyce came, and he still a talking impertinent fellow.

1663-03-31 07:30   I lay long talking with my wife about my father’s coming, which I expect to-day, coming up with the horses brought up for my Lord.

1663-03-30 21:40   To bed, finding myself in the same condition I was lately by the cold weather, my pores stopt and so my body all inflamed and itching.

1663-03-30 18:22   To see my Lord Sandwich, who I found very merry and every day better and better.

1663-03-30 05:27   Up betimes and found my weather-glass sunk again just to the same position which it was last night before I had any fire made in my chamber.

1663-03-29 23:26   Fell hard to make up my monthly accounts, letting my family go to bed after prayers. I staid up long, and find myself fully worth 670l.

1663-03-29 16:30   Reading over some papers, old precedents concerning the practice of this office heretofore, which I am glad to find and shall make use of.

1663-03-29 07:10   Waked betimes, but being cold I lay long, it raining and snowing very hard, which I did never think it would have done any more this year.

1663-03-28 17:48   Home again walking both forwards and backwards, as much along the street as we could to save going by water.

1663-03-28 14:28   Though a very cold day and high wind, yet I took Creed by land to Deptford, my common walk, where I did some little businesses.

1663-03-27 16:33   In Paul’s Churchyard, at the foreign Bookseller’s looking over some Spanish books, with much ado keeping myself from laying out money there.

1663-03-26 22:12   My maid Susan went away to-day, I giving her something for her lodging and diet somewhere else that I might have room for my new maid.

1663-03-26 22:09   All the afternoon sat at the office about business, and so dispatch business and home to supper and to bed.

1663-03-26 12:10   Came a new cook-maid at 4l. per annum, the first time I ever did give so much, but we hope it will be nothing lost by keeping a good cook.

1663-03-26 09:20   I could not get my feast to be kept to-day, because of my wife’s being ill and other disorders by my servants being out of order.

1663-03-26 06:07   This day is five years since it pleased God to preserve me at my being cut of the stone, of which I bless God I am in all respects well.

1663-03-25 20:40   I cannot have my dinner as I ought in memory of my being cut for the stone, but I must have it a day or two hence.

1663-03-25 20:34   This day being washing day and my maid Susan ill, put my house so out of order that we had no pleasure almost in anything.

1663-03-25 18:21   Consulting upon the book and Ruler that I bought this morning of Browne concerning the lyne of numbers, in which I find much pleasure.

1663-03-24 12:02   At Browne’s, the mathematician in the Minnerys, with a design of buying White’s ruler to measure timber, but could not agree on the price.

1663-03-24 10:24   To the Victualling Office. We went into their Bakehouse, and saw all the ovens at work, and good bread too, as ever I would desire to eat.

1663-03-24 06:50   Lay pretty long, that is, till past six o’clock, and then up and W. Howe and I merry together, till having eat our breakfast, he went away.

1663-03-23 23:06   This day Greatorex brought me a very pretty weather-glass for heat and cold.

1663-03-23 22:44   Home, where I found Will. Howe come home to-day with my wife, and staid with us all night, staying late up singing songs.

1663-03-23 16:13   Sir R. Ford, Sir W. Rider, and I were chosen to bring in some laws for the Civill government of Tangier, which I am little able to do.

1663-03-22 15:20   I to the church expecting to see the young ladies of the school, Ashwell desiring me, but I could not get in far enough, and so came out.

1663-03-22 14:40   To Westminster, where being come too soon for the Christening we took up Mr Creed and went to take some ayre, as far as Chelsey and further.

1663-03-21 15:22   Our board met, and Sir Philip Warwick and Sir Robert Long came from my Lord Treasurer to speak about the state of the debts of the Navy.

1663-03-20 17:44   I hear how there had like to have been a surprizall of Dublin by some discontented protestants, and other things of like nature.

1663-03-20 16:57   Calling at my brother’s I find he has got a new maid, very likely girl, I wish he do not play the fool with her.

1663-03-20 15:28   In Fleet Street bought me a little sword, with gilt handle, cost 23s, and silk stockings to the colour of my riding cloth suit, cost I 5s.

1663-03-20 08:42   Walked to Deptford, where up and down the yarde, and met the two clerks of the Cheques to conclude by our method their callbooks.

1663-03-19 22:06   Home to supper, and to bed, being weary and vexed that I do not find other people so willing to do business as myself.

1663-03-19 09:58   Deane walking with me; talking of the pride and corruption of most of his fellow officers of the yard, and which I believe to be true.

1663-03-18 21:40   This day my tryangle, which was put in tune yesterday, did please me very well, Ashwell playing upon it pretty well.

1663-03-18 06:58   Talk with my wife about a wench she has hired yesterday which I would have enquired of before she comes, she having lived in great families.

1663-03-17 21:44   I am confident there is no man almost in the City cares a turd for my Lord Mayor, nor hath he brains to outwit any ordinary tradesman.

1663-03-17 20:59   My Lord Mayor is resolved in pulling down the shops quite through the City, and will make a thorough passage quite through the City.

1663-03-17 20:31   I do find Sir R. Ford an able man of his brains and tongue, and a scholler. But my Lord Mayor I find to be a talking, bragging Bufflehead.

1663-03-16 17:49   I to my wife at my Lord’s lodgings, where I heard Ashwell play first upon the harpsicon, and she do play pretty well, which pleaseth me.

1663-03-16 07:42   Up very betimes and to my office, where, with several Masters of the King’s ships, Sir J. Minnes and I advising upon the business of Slopps.

1663-03-15 11:25   The weather, which of late has been very hot and fair, turns very wet and cold. It thundered mightily, which I have not heard a great while.

1663-03-14 19:13   I find Ashwell is a pretty ingenuous girl at all sorts of fine work, and I hope will be good entertainment for my wife without much cost.

1663-03-14 14:07   Talking of the poor service which Sir J. Lawson did do in the Streights, for which all this great fame and honour done him is risen.

1663-03-14 10:43   A great rant I did give to Mr. Davis, of Deptford, and others about their usage of Michell, in his Bewpers, which he serves in for flaggs.

1663-03-13 18:07   To Mrs. Hunt’s, and there found my wife, and so took them up by coach, and carried them to Hide Park, where store of coaches and good faces.

1663-03-13 15:27   I to Whitehall and St. James’s Park, where I walked an hour or two with great pleasure, it being a most pleasant day.

1663-03-13 12:58   I found Captain Grove to be a very stout man, and I do think that he is, and one that bears me respect and deserves to be encouraged.

1663-03-12 22:06   To supper and to bed, and find by Ashwell’s discourse and carriage to-night that she is not proud, but will do what she is bid.

1663-03-12 21:10   I found Mary Ashwell come to live with us, pray God she may please us, which, though it cost me something, yet will give me much content.

1663-03-12 14:44   I to the office, where at the choice of maisters and chyrurgeons for the fleet now going out, I did my business as I could wish.

1663-03-11 12:10   Had news that Butler, our chief witness against Field, was sent to New England contrary to our desire, which made me mad almost.

1663-03-11 08:12   Walked in the garden with Sir W. Batten, talking about the difference between his Lady and my wife yesterday. I doubt my wife is to blame.

1663-03-10 20:52   Before 9 home, which is rare with me of late, I staying longer, but with multitude of business my head akes, and so I can stay no longer.

1663-03-10 13:55   My wife vexed at a fray this morning with my Lady Batten about my boy’s going thither to turn the watercock with their maydes’ leave.

1663-03-10 12:30   Sir J. Minnes told me how sensible he is of Sir W. Pen’s treachery in this business. I am pleased to hear that his knavery is found out.

1663-03-10 11:42   Up and to my office all the morning, and great pleasure it is to be doing my business betimes.

1663-03-09 13:24   Upon my word, those of the Protector are more like in my mind, than the King’s, but both very well worth seeing.

1663-03-09 13:22   Mr. Slingsby of the Mint showed us the new pieces both gold and silver made for the King, and compared them with those made for Oliver.

1663-03-08 15:07   To my Lord Sandwich. I found him out of order, thinking himself to be in a fit of an ague, but in the afternoon he was very cheery.

1663-03-08 11:01   I heard Dr. King, Bishop of Chichester, make a good and eloquent sermon upon these words, “They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy.”

1663-03-07 15:38   To my Lord Sandwich, who is gone to Sir W. Wheeler’s for his more quiet being, where he slept well, and I took him merry, playing at cards.

1663-03-07 12:47   It may be the sea may do John good in reclaiming him, and therefore I will see what I can do.

1663-03-07 12:40   To dinner, and met The. Turner, who is come on foot in a frolique to beg me to get a place at sea for John, their man, which is a rogue.

1663-03-07 12:08   Sir W. Pen began to talk with me like a counterfeit rogue very kindly about his house, but he is a cheating fellow, so I answered nothing.

1663-03-06 21:41   My Lord Sandwich is so ill that Mr. Povy is much afeard of him, which puts me to pain, not more for my own sake than for his poor family’s.

1663-03-06 20:07   My boy Waynman’s brother was with me, and I did tell him again that I must part with the boy, for I will not keep him.

1663-03-06 18:48   The House of Commons have been very high against the Papists, being incensed by the stir which they make for their having an Indulgence.

1663-03-06 15:20   We did discourse at again about Sir W. Pen’s patent to be his assistant, and I perceive Sir J. Minnes is resolved never to let it pass.

1663-03-06 12:59   There dined with us Mr. Falconer’s new wife, which had been his mayde, but seems to be a genteel woman, well enough bred and discreet.

1663-03-06 12:07   To the rope yard and ordered several matters, and so into Mr. Falconer’s, where we had some fish, which we brought with us, dressed.

1663-03-05 20:58   I shall meet with nothing to oppose my growing great in the office but Sir W. Pen, who is now well again, and comes into the office brisk.

1663-03-05 10:53   I found my Lord Sandwich very ill, and being several nights hindered from sleep, he is hardly able to open his eyes, which troubled me much.

1663-03-05 09:07   In the Hall I do hear that the Catholiques are in great hopes for all this, and do set hard upon the King to get Indulgence.

1663-03-04 19:31   I perfected an alphabet for my Navy Manuscript to my great content.

1663-03-03 22:07   Home to supper and to bed, the sooner having taken some cold yesterday upon the water, which brings me my usual pain.

1663-03-03 15:14   The King is highly incensed at the Parliament’s late opposing the Indulgence; which I am sorry for, and fear it will breed great discontent.

1663-03-03 14:20   After dinner I took them down into the wine-cellar, and broached my tierce of claret for them.

1663-03-03 14:07   We were as merry as I could be, having but a bad dinner for them.

1663-03-03 12:06   By promise, Mrs. Turner and her daughter, and Mrs. Morrice, came along with Roger Pepys to dinner.

1663-03-02 18:23   So to my office.

1663-03-02 18:21   My wife alone at work, the house foul, it being washing day, which troubled me, because tomorrow I must be forced to have friends at dinner.

1663-03-02 14:58   To the Ropeyard, and saw a trial between Riga hemp and Indian grass, which is pretty strong, but no comparison between it and the other.

1663-03-02 11:24   Going aboard the Hulke, I did fall into the ship, and had like to have broke my left hand, but I only sprained some of my fingers.

1663-03-02 09:44   There coming into the river two Dutchmen, we bought three Hollands cheeses, excellent cheeses, whereof I had two and Commissioner Pett one.

1663-03-02 09:30   We went down five miles with pleasure, it being a fine day, and a brave gale of wind, and had some oysters brought us aboard newly taken.

1663-03-02 07:04   By water with Commissioner Pett down to Woolwich, where we discoursed of several matters both there and at the Ropeyard.

1663-03-01 22:20   We all to bed, without prayers, it being washing day to-morrow.

1663-03-01 20:09   Home, whither came Will. Joyce, whom I have not seen here a great while, nor desire it a great while again, he is so impertinent a coxcomb.

1663-03-01 16:33   To my Lord Sandwich, who continues with a great cold, locked up.

1663-03-01 14:06   Much genteel company, and, among other things, I hear for certain that peace is concluded between the King of France and the Pope.

1663-03-01 11:04   Preached Dr. Lewes, said to have been a great witt; but he read his sermon every word, and so brokenly and so low, that nobody could hear.
