1663-09-30 21:50   Home, where I found our new cooke-mayde Elizabeth, whom my wife never saw, nor I but once at a distance, but recommended well by Mr. Creed.

1663-09-30 21:15   I do find myself 760l. creditor, notwithstanding that for clothes for myself and wife, and layings out on her closett, I have spent 47l.

1663-09-30 09:26   My hearing pretty well again, and so to my office, by and by Mr. Holliard come, and he searched my ear, and I hope all will be well.

1663-09-29 19:42   It fell to thunder, lighten, and rain so violently that my house was all afloat, and I in all the rain up to the gutters.

1663-09-29 14:09   I had a fire made and then, being dry again, my wife and I to put up some paper pictures in the red chamber, where we go to lie very pretty.

1663-09-29 13:24   To carry several heavy things with my wife up and down stairs, in order to our going to lie above, and that put me into a violent sweat.

1663-09-28 21:55   Home to supper, being hungry, and my ear and cold not so bad I think as it was. So to bed, taking one of my pills.

1663-09-28 15:44   To a sale of old provisions at Deptford, to the value of 600l. or 700l, but I am not satisfied with the method used in this thing.

1663-09-28 11:12   What with Sir R. Ford’s and our houses being new painted, the street begins to look a great deal better than it did, and more gracefull.

1663-09-28 11:10   Sir J. Minnes and I home, finding the street about our house full, Sir R. Ford beginning his shrievalty to-day.

1663-09-28 08:01   I called at Mr. Holliard’s, who did give me some pills, and tells me I shall have my hearing again and be well.

1663-09-27 21:15   I went to bed with a posset, being very melancholy in consideration of the loss of my hearing.

1663-09-27 20:05   It is a cold, which God Almighty in justice did give me while I sat lewdly sporting with Mrs. Lane the other day.

1663-09-27 20:00   To supper, though with little comfort, I finding myself both head and breast in pain, and what troubles me most my right ear is almost deaf.

1663-09-27 19:15   Home to spend the evening with my poor wife, consulting about her closett, clothes, and other things.

1663-09-27 12:32   Home to dinner, being a little troubled to see Pembleton out again, but I do not discern in my wife the least memory of him.

1663-09-26 23:42   To the office, and there till late at night, and so home to supper and bed, being mightily pleased to find my wife so mindful of her house.

1663-09-26 14:20   I made haste home, and was forced to sit down again at dinner with my wife, being unwilling to neglect her by being known to dine abroad.

1663-09-26 12:58   Mr Rawlinson he would have me home to dinner, and we dined at his dinner, but I sat with little pleasure, considering my wife at home alone.

1663-09-25 10:55   With Sir J Minnes and Sir W Batten to Deptford where it of a sudden did lighten, thunder, and rain. We could do nothing but stay in Davis’s.

1663-09-24 23:49   That is just with God to make my wife bad with me for my wronging of her, but I do resolve never to do the like again. So to bed.

1663-09-24 23:47   Home to supper and bed, and there found my poor wife hard at work, which grieved my heart to see that I should abuse so good a wretch.

1663-09-24 16:49   After being tired with Mrs. Lane’s company I landed her at White Hall, and so home and at my office.

1663-09-24 15:56   And yet I came so near, that I was provoked to spend. But, trust in the Lord, I shall never do so again while I live.

1663-09-24 15:55   I did what I would with Mrs. Lane, but only the main thing, which she would not consent to, for which God be praised.

1663-09-24 15:11   Telling my wife that I go to Deptford, I went, by water to Westminster Hall, and there finding Mrs. Lane, took her over to Lambeth.

1663-09-24 10:33   We sat doing little, now Mr. Coventry is not here, but only vex myself to see what a sort of coxcombs we are when he is not here.

1663-09-23 16:43   Came my brother John, who is to go to Cambridge to-morrow. I did give him a severe reprimand for his bad account he gives me of his studies.

1663-09-23 15:20   To Westminster Hall, thinking to meet Mrs. Lane, which is my great vanity upon me at present, but I must correct it. She was not in the way.

1663-09-23 12:49   Thinking to have my Lord Crew and Sir Thomas inquire about my Lord’s lodgings at Chelsey, but they did not, which is their discretion.

1663-09-22 22:03   My present care is fitting my wife’s closett and my house, and making her a velvet coate, and me a new black cloth suit, and cloake.

1663-09-22 20:48   Every day brings newes of the Turke’s advance into Germany, to the awakeing of all the Christian Princes thereabouts.

1663-09-22 18:28   This day the King and Queen are to come to Oxford. My Lady Castlemaine is gone to Oxford to meet him, having supposed to have miscarried.

1663-09-22 11:32   My wife showed me bills printed, wherein her father, with Sir John Collidon and Sir Edward Ford, have a patent for curing of smoky chimneys.

1663-09-21 20:04   By and by comes my wife by coach well home, and having got a good fowl ready for supper against her coming, we eat heartily.

1663-09-21 19:45   Sir W. Batten has in my absence inveighed against my contract for Warren’s masts, in which he is a knave, and it vexes me a little.

1663-09-21 19:20   I and the boy home as fast as we could, and it was even night before we got home. At home found all very well and my house in good order.

1663-09-21 15:09   My wife being very weary, I took the opportunity of an empty coach that was to go to London, and left her to come in it, for half-a-crown.

1663-09-21 11:55   Through Baldwicke, where a fayre is kept to-day, and a great one for cheese and other such commodities, and so to Hatfield.

1663-09-21 07:07   Up very betimes by break of day; and after eating something, and changing of a piece of gold to pay the reckoning, we mounted.

1663-09-20 15:26   After a word or two to my father and mother, my wife and I mounted, and, with my father’s boy, we rode to Bigglesworth.

1663-09-20 10:38   My Lord took me with the rest of the company, and demanded my opinion in his garden, about the bringing of the wall on the mount to a shape.

1663-09-19 20:45   Mr. Howe tells me my Lord do not enjoy himself as he used to do, but will hasten to London, and that he is resolved to go to Chelsey again.

1663-09-19 18:08   I observing my Lord not to be so mightily ingulphed in his pleasure in the country as I expected and hoped.

1663-09-19 16:30   To Hinchingbroke, where my Lord and ladies all are just alighted.

1663-09-19 14:55   Being highly pleased, and in my wife’s riding and good company at this time, I rode, and she showed me the river behind my father’s house.

1663-09-19 14:06   My wife and I took horse, and rode with marvellous pleasure, that ever I had in this estate since I had to do with it, to Brampton woods.

1663-09-19 10:58   Madam Norbery and her daughter and sister I was ashamed to kiss, but did, my lip being sore with riding in the wind and bit with the gnatts.

1663-09-19 10:49   To Brampton, where I find my father ill in bed still.

1663-09-18 21:58   After supper, and my telling of three stories, to their good liking, of spirits, we all three in a chamber went to bed.

1663-09-18 19:34   We mounted again, and rode, being very merry, to Chatteris, my uncle very weary.

1663-09-18 12:16   To Wisbeach, a pretty town, and a fine church and library, where sundry very old abbey manuscripts.

1663-09-18 09:22   Over most sad Fenns, observing the sad life which the people of the place which if they be born there, they do call the Breedlings, do live.

1663-09-18 07:10   After eating a dish of cold cream, which was my supper last night too, we took leave of our beggarly company, though they seem good people.

1663-09-18 05:03   I was bit cruelly, and nobody else of our company, which I wonder at, by the gnatts.

1663-09-18 00:20   They waked me to tell me that the horse was found, which was good newes.

1663-09-17 23:50   To bed in a sad, cold, nasty chamber, only the mayde was indifferent handsome, and so I had a kiss or two of her, and I to bed.

1663-09-17 22:20   They doubting a person that lay at next door, a Londoner, we caused him to be secured in his bed, and care to be taken to seize the horse.

1663-09-17 22:05   Newes is brought to us that one of our horses is stole, which proves my uncle’s, at which I am inwardly glad — I mean, that it was not mine.

1663-09-17 21:15   We sat down to supper; the whole crew, and Frank’s wife and child, a sad company, of which I was ashamed, supped with us.

1663-09-17 20:35   I found my uncle and aunt Perkins, and their daughters, poor wretches! in a sad, poor thatched cottage, like a poor barn, or stable.

1663-09-17 20:10   Through the fens, where we were ready to have our horses sink to the belly, we got, with hard riding, to Parson’s Drove, a heathen place.

1663-09-17 07:30   My father being gone to bed ill last night, I resolved to go with my uncle and his son to Wisbeach about my uncle Day’s estate.

1663-09-16 07:10   With my wife to Hinchingbroke to see my Lady, she being to go to my Lord this morning, and there I left her, and so back to the Court.

1663-09-15 21:50   After supper my uncle and his son to Stankes’s to bed, which troubles me, all our father’s beds being lent to Hinchingbroke.

1663-09-15 17:20   Here I saw Mrs. Betty Pickering, who is a very well-bred and comely lady, but very fat.

1663-09-15 17:15   To Hinchingbroke, and I alone with my Lady, she carrying me through every part of the house and gardens, which are mighty noble indeed.

1663-09-15 14:20   To Brampton to my father’s, and there found all well, but not sensible how they ought to treat my uncle and his son.

1663-09-15 12:12   Rode to Godmanchester, Mr. Moore having two falls, once in water and another in dirt, and there ‘light and eat and drunk, all of us weary.

1663-09-14 21:40   I called in my company, and supped in the chamber by my wife, and being very merry in talk, supped and then parted, and I to bed.

1663-09-14 19:48   With some strong water, and after a little vomit, my wife came to be pretty well again; and so to bed.

1663-09-14 19:03   In great horror, and having a great tryall of my true love and passion for my wife, called the mayds and mistresse of the house.

1663-09-14 18:52   I alone with my wife in a great chamber there, that I thought she would have died.

1663-09-14 18:07   After a little bayte at Ware, to Buntingford, where my wife, by drinking some cold beer, being hot herself, begins to be sick.

1663-09-14 07:20   Mr. Moore and my wife set out before, and my uncle and I staid for his son Thomas, who, by a sudden resolution, is preparing to go with us.

1663-09-14 04:48   Up betimes, and my wife’s mind and mine holding for her going, so she to get her ready, and I abroad to do the like for myself.

1663-09-13 20:25   After some difficulties made, did send about for a horse and other things, and so I think my wife will go.

1663-09-13 20:10   Saying to my wife, in ordinary fondness, “Well! shall you and I never travel together again?” she offered and desired to go along with me.

1663-09-13 15:46   Comes my uncle Wight to bid us to dinner to-morrow to a haunch of venison I sent them, given me by Mr. Povy. I cannot go, but my wife will.

1663-09-13 01:15   Griffin was fain to carry the letter to Westminster to go by express, my other letters of import to my father and elsewhere could not go.

1663-09-13 01:03   To my office writing a laborious letter about our last account to my Lord Treasurer, which took me to one o’clock in the morning.

1663-09-12 13:45   The truth is I do find my uncle Thomas a much more cunning fellow than I ever took him for, nay in his very drink he has his wits about him.

1663-09-12 12:30   By appointment met and bring home my uncle Thomas, who resolves to go with me to Brampton. I wish he may hold his mind.

1663-09-12 06:03   With great content that I have begun an acquaintance with Sir Philip Warwick, a man of as much business as any man in England.

1663-09-11 17:11   Visited my Lord Crew and Sir Thomas, thinking they might have enquired of me touching my Lord’s matters at Chelsey, but they said nothing.

1663-09-11 14:02   To dinner at the Dolphin where I eat well but drank no wine which keeps me in such good order that I am mightily pleased with myself for it.

1663-09-10 19:14   Our cook maid (we having no luck in maids now-adays), fell sick and is gone to her friends, having been with us but 4 days.

1663-09-10 16:42   Mr. Moore tells me of the good peace that is made at Tangier with the Moores, but to continue but from six months to six months.

1663-09-10 11:58   Up betimes and to my office, and there sat all the morning making a great contract with Sir W. Warren for 3,000l. worth of masts.

1663-09-09 19:36   Pickering telling of my Lord playing on his lute under Mrs. Becke’s window, and forty other poor sordid things, which I am grieved to hear.

1663-09-09 19:28   My Lord will have his private lust undisturbed with this common whore, his sitting up night after night, suffering nobody to come to them.

1663-09-09 19:20   Ned Pickering telling me of my Lord’s folly with this Mrs. Becke, at Chelsey, of which I am ashamed to see my Lord so grossly play the fool.

1663-09-09 09:44   A boy overtook us with a fine cupp turned out of Lignum Vitae, which the child confessed was made by his father, and that I might have one.

1663-09-09 09:30   Sir W. Warren and I down by water to Woolwich, and there I did several businesses, and had good discourse, and thence walked to Greenwich.

1663-09-08 17:03   I saw Moxon’s great window, where there is the two Terrestrial Hemispheres, so painted as I never saw in my life, and nobly done.

1663-09-08 16:40   To Moxon’s and bought a payre of globes cost me 3l. 10s, with which I am pleased, buying them for my wife who has a mind to understand them.

1663-09-07 20:42   Afeard of laying out too much money upon my house, but it is not money flung away, though I reckon nothing money but when it is in the bank.

1663-09-07 17:18   I hied home, buying several things at the ironmonger’s — dogs, tongs, and shovels — for my wife’s closett and the rest of my house.

1663-09-07 16:07   To Bartholomew Fayre, where Mr. Pickering and I to see the monkeys at the Dutch house, which is beyond the other that I saw the other day.

1663-09-07 14:47   Through Fleet Ally, God forgive me, out of an itch to look upon the sluts there, against which when I saw them my stomach turned.

1663-09-06 19:10   I staid at home all day and my wife also, whom, God forgive me, I staid along with me for fear of her seeing of Pembleton.

1663-09-06 07:35   My pill I took last night worked very well, and I lay long in bed and sweat to get away the itching all about my body from head to foot.

1663-09-05 19:15   I hear that Sir W. Batten was fain to put ashore at Queenborough with my Lady, who has been so sick she swears never to go to sea again.

1663-09-05 17:43   Above all things, it seems strange to me that matters should not be understood before they went out.

1663-09-05 17:42   I did inform myself well in things relating to the East Indys; both of the country and the disappointment the King met with the last voyage.

1663-09-05 15:57   Creed, my wife, and I to Cornhill, and after many tryalls bought my wife a chintz, a painted Indian calico, for to line her new study.

1663-09-05 14:22   After dinner mightily importuned by Captain Hicks, who came to tell my wife the story of all the shells, a present he made the other day.

1663-09-04 21:31   Above all there was represented the sea, with Neptune, Venus, mermaids, and Ayrid on a dolphin, the sea rocking, so well done.

1663-09-04 21:20   There was also a horse with hoofs like rams hornes, a goose with four feet, and a cock with three.

1663-09-04 21:10   To Bartholomew Fayre, and showed my wife monkeys dancing on ropes, which was strange, but such dirty sport that I was not pleased with it.

1663-09-04 14:33   In a room next to it such a grotto and fountayne, which in summer will be so pleasant as nothing in the world can be almost.

1663-09-04 14:32   To see Mr. Povy’s new cellars, which he has made so fine with so noble an arch and such contrivances for his barrels and bottles.

1663-09-04 13:40   To Mr. Povy’s. We had plenty of meat and drink, though I drunk no wine, though mightily urged to it.

1663-09-04 07:57   Methinks if Mrs. Lane were very modest, considering how I tumbled her and tost her, she should desire to have me come to see her.

1663-09-04 07:55   To speak to Mrs. Lane, who seems desirous to have me come to see her and to have her company as I had a little while ago.

1663-09-04 07:15   To Westminster Hall, and there bought the first newes-books of L’Estrange’s writing; he makes, methinks, but a simple beginning.

1663-09-03 20:24   Very well pleased with Mr. Cutler’s coming to me about business. They value me as a man of business, which he accounts the best virtuoso.

1663-09-03 09:20   The wind very fresh, and I believe they will be all sicke enough, besides that my Lady is mighty troublesome on the water.

1663-09-03 09:10   To Sir W Batten who is going for pleasure to the Downes. At my Lady’s desire with them to Greenwich where I went aboard the Charlotte yacht.

1663-09-03 05:40   Up betimes, and for an hour at my viall before my people rise.

1663-09-02 19:22   Mr. Lewellin, lately come from Ireland, tells me how the English interest falls mightily there, the Irish party being too great.

1663-09-02 17:30   I found my wife mightily pleased with a present of fine shells given her by Captain Hickes, and indeed they are very pleasant ones.

1663-09-02 13:39   To dinner with my Lord Mayor and the Aldermen. A great dinner and excellent venison, but it almost made me sick by not daring to drink wine.

1663-09-02 11:47   Going through the City my Lord Mayor told me how the piller set up by Exeter House is only to show where the pipes of water run to the City.

1663-09-02 10:34   The woman run away with a silver tankard, a porringer of silver, and a couple of spoons, and being now found guilty, likely will be hanged.

1663-09-02 10:32   I heard a tryall, a woman that went and was indicted by four names for entering herself a cookemayde to a gentleman that prosecuted her.

1663-09-02 09:55   We rode along with my Lord Mayor in his coach to the Sessions House in the Old Bayley, where the Sessions are now sitting.

1663-09-01 19:57   My wife deserves to be pleased and complied with a little, considering the manner of life that I keep her to.

1663-09-01 19:34   I discoursed long with my brother about how imprudent it is for my father and mother and him to take exceptions without cause at my wife.

1663-09-01 19:03   My brother John coming to me to complain that my wife seems to be discontented at his being here, and shows him great disrespect.

1663-09-01 10:44   To my office, and I got my bill for my carved work (which I expected to have paid for myself) signed, and hope to get the money back again.
