1665-10-31 22:52   Laneare did, at the request of Mr. Hill, bring two or three the finest prints for my wife to see that ever I did see in all my life.

1665-10-31 22:28   To sing, which Mrs. Coleman do very finely, though her voice is decayed as to strength but mighty sweet though soft, and a pleasant jolly woman, and in mighty good humour was to-night.

1665-10-31 21:06   I come home, and there find Mrs. Pierce come and little Fran. Tooker, and Mr. Hill, and other people, a great many dancing, and anon comes Mrs. Coleman with her husband and Laneare.

1665-10-31 09:04   Meeting yesterday the Searchers with their rods in their hands coming from Captain Cocke’s house, I did overhear them say that the fellow did not die of the plague, but he had I know been ill a good while.

1665-10-31 09:00   Sir W. Batten met me, and did tell me that Captain Cocke’s black was dead of the plague, which I had heard of before, but took no notice.

1665-10-31 00:05   Coleman’s voice is quite spoiled, and when he begins to be drunk he is excellent company, but afterward troublesome and impertinent. Laneare sings in a melancholy method very well, and a sober man he seems to be.

1665-10-30 23:57   I home, and there find Mr. Hill with Mr. Coleman and Mr. Laneare, with whom with their Lute we had excellent company and good singing till midnight, and a good supper I did give them.

1665-10-30 00:05   To supper and discourse of musique and so to bed, I lying with Mr. Hill talking till midnight about Berckenshaw’s musique rules, which I did to his great satisfaction inform him in, and so to sleep.

1665-10-29 20:50   I was set down at Woolwich town end, and walked through the town in the dark, it being now night. But in the street did overtake and almost run upon two women crying and carrying a man’s coffin between them. I suppose the husband of one of them, which, methinks, is a sad thing.

1665-10-29 13:47   Not being satisfied with Cocke’s arguments, my Lord and I did oppose the strength of his arguments, which brought us to a great heat, he being a conceited man, but of no Logique in his head at all, which made my Lord and I mirth.

1665-10-29 13:45   We fell to discourse about the Dutch, Cocke undertaking to prove that they were able to wage war with us three years together.

1665-10-29 12:55   Set out with Captain Cocke in his coach toward Erith, Mr. Deane riding along with us, where we dined and were very merry.

1665-10-28 22:40   The King and Court, they say, have now finally resolved to spend nothing upon clothes, but what is of the growth of England; which, if observed, will be very pleasing to the people, and very good for them.

1665-10-28 21:05   To Greenwich, and there I to the office very late, offering my persons for all the victualling posts much to my satisfaction.

1665-10-27 13:55   The Duke of Albemarle proposed to me from Mr. Coventry that I should be Surveyor-Generall of the Victualling business, which I accepted. The terms in which Mr. Coventry proposes it for me are the most obliging that ever I could expect from any man.

1665-10-27 09:16   Away with Captain Cocke in his coach through Kent Street, a miserable, wretched, poor place, people sitting sick and muffled up with plasters at every 4 or 5 doors.

1665-10-27 00:22   To supper, and then to dance again (Golding being our fiddler, who plays very well and all tunes) till past twelve at night, and then we broke up and every one to bed.

1665-10-26 21:25   I to the office, and so to them and there saw them dance very prettily, Captain Ferrers and his wife, my wife and Mrs. Barbary, and Mercer and my landlady’s daughter.

1665-10-26 20:40   I to the office till night, and then they come and tell me my wife is come to town, so I to her vexed at her coming, but it was upon innocent business, so I was pleased and made her stay.

1665-10-26 11:30   The ’Change pretty full, and the town begins to be lively again, though the streets very empty, and most shops shut.

1665-10-26 11:15   I hear how the French have taken two and sunk one of our merchant-men in the Streights, and carried the ships to Toulon; so that there is no expectation but we must fall out with them.

1665-10-26 08:10   Sir Christopher Mings and I together by water to the Tower; and I find him a very witty well-spoken fellow, and mighty free to tell his parentage, being a shoemaker’s son, to whom he is now going.

1665-10-25 11:22   My Lord tells me that nothing at Court is minded but faction and pleasure, and nothing intended of general good to the kingdom by anybody heartily; so that he believes with me, in a little time confusion will certainly come over all the nation.

1665-10-25 10:30   My Lord tells me, as very private, that there are great factions at the Court between the King’s party and the Duke of Yorke’s, and that the King, which is a strange difficulty, do favour my Lord in opposition to the Duke’s party.

1665-10-24 20:10   My Lord, to my great content, did tell me that never anything was read to the King and Council, as my letter about the Victualling was, and no more said upon it than a most thorough consent to every word was said, and directed, that it be pursued and practised.

1665-10-24 14:32   To my office, and no sooner there but to my great surprise am told that my Lord Sandwich is come to town; so I presently to Boreman’s, where he is and there found him.

1665-10-24 13:40   I to Cocke, where Mr. Evelyn was, to dinner, and there merry, yet vexed again at public matters, and to see how little heed is had to the prisoners and sick and wounded.

1665-10-23 22:15   My Lord Rutherford and I supped together and sat up late, he being a mighty wanton man with a daughter in law of my landlady’s, a pretty conceited woman big with child, and he would be handling her breasts, which she coyly refused.

1665-10-23 13:32   On board the East India ship, where my Lord Bruncker had provided a great dinner, and thither comes by and by Sir John Minnes and before him Sir W. Warren and anon a Perspective glass maker, of whom we, every one, bought a pocket glass.

1665-10-23 11:20   To Erith, where my Lord Bruncker and I dispatched some business. Among other things about the slopsellers, who have trusted us so long, they are not able, nor can be expected to trust us further, and I fear this winter the fleet will be undone by that particular.

1665-10-22 21:20   I and Mr. Salomon to Mr. Glanville’s, and there we found Cocke and sat and supped, and was mighty merry with only Madam Penington, who is a fine, witty lady.

1665-10-22 15:10   My Lord Duke tells me the Dutch Embassador at Oxford is clapped up, but since I hear it is not true.

1665-10-22 13:58   However, fresh meat was brought for me to the Duke’s table, and there I dined, and full of discourse and very kind.

1665-10-22 13:55   I took Captain Cocke’s chariot, and to Lambeth; but, in going and getting over the water, and through White Hall, I spent so much time, my Lord Duke Albemarle had almost dined.

1665-10-21 22:05   Back again to the office, and there very late very busy, and so home to supper and to bed.

1665-10-21 12:12   Up, and to my office, where busy all the morning.

1665-10-20 17:41   This I confess to my trouble is true, but it arises from my being forced to take so much business upon me, more than is my proper task to undertake.

1665-10-20 17:39   With Mr. Hater, discoursing of the business of the office, where he tells me that among others Thomas Willson do now and then seem to hint that I do take too much business upon me, more than I can do, and that therefore some do lie undone.

1665-10-20 01:10   Back to my office, and there till past one before I could get all these letters and papers copied out, which vexed me, but so sent them away without hopes of saving the post.

1665-10-19 13:41   I come to an agreement yesterday with my landlady for 6l. per month, for so many rooms for myself, them, and my wife and maid, when she shall come, and to pay besides for my dyet.

1665-10-18 22:10   I was the making of my accounts late and did it pretty perfectly, and so, after eating something, to bed, my mind eased of a great deal of figures and castings.

1665-10-18 17:15   To the making of my accounts up of Tangier, which I did with great difficulty, finding the difference between short and long reckonings where I have had occasion to mix my moneys, as I have of late done my Tangier treasure upon other occasions, and other moneys upon that.

1665-10-17 20:04   All day long busy at the office, mighty busy, only stepped to my lodging and had a fowl for my dinner.

1665-10-16 19:06   To the Still Yard, which place, however, is now shut up of the plague; but I was there, and we now make no bones of it.

1665-10-16 11:23   They tell me that, in Westminster, there is never a physician and but one apothecary left, all being dead; but that there are great hopes of a great decrease this week: God send it!

1665-10-16 11:15   Lord! how empty the streets are and melancholy, so many poor sick people in the streets full of sores; and so many sad stories overheard as I walk, every body talking of this dead, and that man sick, and so many in this place, and so many in that.

1665-10-16 08:22   Mr. Povy discoursing of the wantonness of the Court. The King doth spend most of his time in feeling and kissing them naked all over their bodies in bed and contents himself, without doing the other thing but as he finds himself inclined.

1665-10-15 21:06   I did never hear one sing with so much pleasure to herself as this lady do, relishing it to her very heart, which was mighty pleasant.

1665-10-15 20:48   To Mr. Povy’s, and after supper to talk and to sing, his man Dutton’s wife singing very pleasantly (a mighty fat woman), and I wrote out one song from her and pricked the tune, both very pretty.

1665-10-15 16:15   Sir Robert Viner and I fell to public talk, and to think how the fleet and seamen will be paid, which he protests he do not think it possible to compass, as the world is now: no money got by trade, nor the persons that have it by them in the City to be come at.

1665-10-15 09:05   Mr. Povy and I set out, having drunk a draft of mulled sacke; and so rode most nobly, in his most pretty and best contrived charriott in the world, with many new conveniences.

1665-10-15 07:30   While I staid for the barber, tried to compose a duo of counterpoint, and I think it will do very well, it being by Mr. Berckenshaw’s rule.

1665-10-14 19:38   The town, I hear, is full of talk that there are great differences in the fleet among the great Commanders, and that Mings at Oxford did impeach my Lord of something, I think about these goods, but this is but talke.

1665-10-13 16:14   The Duke tells me that there is no news heard of the Dutch, what they do or where they are, but believes that they are all gone home, for none of our spyes can give us any tidings of them.

1665-10-13 15:30   I by water to the Duke of Albemarle, where I find him with Lord Craven and Lieutenant of the Tower about him; among other things, talking of ships to get of the King to fetch coles for the poor of the city, which is a good work.

1665-10-13 08:05   Comes Sir Jer. Smith to see me in his way to Court, and a good man he is, and one that I must keep fair with, and will, it being I perceive my interest to have kindness with the Commanders.

1665-10-12 19:20   Good news this week that there are about 600 less dead of the plague than the last.

1665-10-11 22:10   Having danced with my people as long as I saw fit to sit up, I to bed and left them to do what they would.

1665-10-11 20:50   This night is kept in lieu of yesterday, for my wedding day of ten years; for which God be praised! being now in an extreme good condition of health and estate and honour.

1665-10-11 20:35   A fine company at my lodgings at Woolwich, where my wife and Mercer, and Mrs. Barbara danced, and mighty merry we were, but especially at Mercer’s dancing a jigg, which she does the best I ever did see, having the most natural way of it.

1665-10-11 10:12   So for three rooms and a dining-room, and for linen and bread and beer and butter, at nights and mornings, I am to give Mrs. Clerke 5l. 10s. per month.

1665-10-11 10:10   Comes up my landlady, Mrs. Clerke, to make an agreement for the time to come; and I, for the having room enough, and to keep out strangers, and to have a place to retreat to for my wife, if the sickness should come to Woolwich, am contented to pay dear.

1665-10-10 20:40   Sir Christopher Mings is newly come from Court, and carries direction for the making a show of getting out the fleet again to go fight the Dutch.

1665-10-09 20:36   The news of the killing of the King of France is wholly untrue, and they say that of the Pope too.

1665-10-09 16:06   I hear another seizure hath been made of our goods by one Captain Fisher that hath been at Chatham by warrant of the Duke of Albemarle, and is come in my absence to Tooker’s and viewed them, demanding the key of the constable, and so sealed up the door.

1665-10-09 14:47   To the office at London, where I did some business about my money and private accounts, and there eat a bit of goose of Mr. Griffin’s, and so by water, it raining most miserably, to Greenwich, calling on several vessels in my passage.

1665-10-09 07:50   Called upon by Sir John Shaw, to whom I did give a civil answer about our prize goods, and showed him our Transire; with which he was satisfied, and parted, ordering his servants to see the weight of them.

1665-10-08 19:55   It seems nobody can make anything of Sir Martin Noell’s estate, whether he be dead worth anything or no, he having dealt in so many things, public and private, as nobody can understand whereabouts his estate is, which is the fate of these great dealers at everything.

1665-10-08 19:10   I hear the Pope is dead; and one said, that the news is, that the King of France is stabbed, but that the former is very true, which will do great things sure, as to the troubling of that part of the world, the King of Spain being so lately dead.

1665-10-08 15:50   To the office, where ended my business with the Captains of the ships in the river; and I think of twenty-two ships we shall make shift to get out seven. (God help us! men being sick, or provisions lacking.)

1665-10-08 14:20   Both before and after dinner, most witty discourse with one Mrs. Penington, who is a very fine witty lady, one of the best I ever heard speak, and indifferent handsome.

1665-10-07 17:18   After some hot and angry words, we locked the goods up, and sealed up the key, and did give it to the constable to keep, and so parted.

1665-10-07 17:04   Come two waggons from Rochester with more goods from Captain Cocke; and in housing them at Mr. Tooker’s lodgings come two of the Custome-house to seize them, and did seize them but I showed them my Transire.

1665-10-07 16:20   A letter come from the Duke of Albemarle, signifying the Dutch to be in sight, with 80 sail, yesterday morning, off of Solebay, coming right into the bay. God knows what they will and may do to us.

1665-10-07 10:33   Did business, though not much, at the office; because of the horrible crowd and lamentable moan of the poor seamen that lie starving in the streets for lack of money – which do trouble and perplex me to the heart.

1665-10-06 10:12   Mr. Gawden did tell me his opinion and knowledge of Sir W. Pen to be, what I know him to be, as false a man as ever was born, for so, it seems, he hath been to him.

1665-10-05 15:32   Mr. Evelyn showed me his gardens, which are for variety of evergreens, and hedge of holly, the finest things I ever saw in my life. Thence in his coach to Greenwich, and there to my office, all the way having fine discourse of trees and the nature of vegetables.

1665-10-05 14:26   To Mr. Evelyn’s to discourse of our confounded business of prisoners, and sick and wounded seamen, wherein he and we are so much put out of order.

1665-10-05 12:20   I walked through Westminster to my old house the Swan, and there did pass some time with Sarah, and so down by water to Deptford. Round about and next door on every side is the plague, but I did not value it, but there did what I would con ella.

1665-10-05 09:10   To the Duke of Albemarle, all my way reading a book of Mr. Evelyn’s translating and sending me as a present, about directions for gathering a Library; but the book is above my reach.

1665-10-04 21:06   Sir George Smith says how all the town is full of Captain Cocke’s being in some ill condition about prize-goods, his goods being taken from him, and I know not what. I believe this news is all false, for he would have wrote to me sure about it.

1665-10-04 20:50   This night comes Sir George Smith to see me at the office, and tells me how the plague is decreased this week 740, for which God be praised! but that it encreases at our end of the town still.

1665-10-03 21:35   I hear that of our two watermen that use to carry our letters, and were well on Saturday last, one is dead, and the other dying sick of the plague.

1665-10-03 20:22   Most of our mirth being upon “my Cozen” (meaning my Lord Bruncker’s ugly mistress, whom he calls cozen), and she tells me that the fine Mrs. Middleton is noted for carrying about her body a continued sour base smell, that is very offensive, especially if she be a little hot.

1665-10-03 20:03   I to Mrs. Pierces and brought my wife and Mrs. Pierce to the King’s Head and there spent a piece upon a supper for her and mighty merry and pretty discourse, she being as pretty as ever.

1665-10-03 08:27   To the office, where nobody to meet me, Sir W. Batten being the only man and he gone this day to meet to adjourne the Parliament to Oxford.

1665-10-02 22:04   I got to Woolwich and there supped and mighty pleasant with my wife, who is, for ought I see, all friends with her maids, and so in great joy and content to bed.

1665-10-02 11:31   Lord! to see what a dreadful thing it is to look down the precipices, for it did fright me mightily, and hinder me of much pleasure which I would have made to myself in the company of these three, if it had not been for that.

1665-10-02 11:29   Going up I did upon the stairs overtake three pretty maids or women and took them up with me, and I did besarlas muchas vezes et tocar leur mains and necks to my great pleasure.

1665-10-02 11:10   To Rochester, walked to the Crowne, and while dinner was getting ready, I did there walk to visit the old Castle ruines, which hath been a noble place.

1665-10-02 08:20   Among other things, a teame of four horses come close by us, he being with me, drawing a piece of timber that I am confident one man could easily have carried upon his back. I made the horses be taken away, and a man or two to take the timber away with their hands.

1665-10-02 08:04   We having sailed all night (and I do wonder how they in the dark could find the way) we got by morning to Gillingham, and thence all walked to Chatham; and there with Commissioner Pett viewed the Yard.

1665-10-02 02:04   Lord! the mirth which it caused me to be waked in the night by their snoaring round about me; I did laugh till I was ready to burst, and waked one of the two companions of Temple.

1665-10-01 17:16   My Lord did whisper to me alone that things here must break in pieces, nobody minding any thing, but every man his own business of profit or pleasure, and that certainly the kingdom could not stand in this condition long, which I fear and believe is very true.

1665-10-01 16:45   My Lord did discourse to us of the Dutch fleet being abroad, eighty-five of them still, and are now at the Texell, he believes, in expectation of our Eastland ships coming home with masts and hemp, and our loaden Hambrough ships going to Hambrough.

1665-10-01 14:05   We come to the fleet about two of the clock in the afternoon, having a fine day and a fine winde.

1665-10-01 11:30   We spent most of the morning talking and reading of “The Siege of Rhodes,” which is certainly (the more I read it the more I think so) the best poem that ever was wrote.

1665-10-01 04:20   Called up about 4 of the clock and so dressed myself and so on board the Bezan, and there finding all my company asleep I would not wake them, but it beginning to be break of day I did stay upon the decke walking.
