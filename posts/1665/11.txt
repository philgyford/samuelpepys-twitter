1665-11-30 21:25   And my father writes as great news of joy to them, that he saw Yorke’s waggon go again this week to London, and was full of passengers; and tells me that my aunt Bell hath been dead of the plague these seven weeks.

1665-11-30 21:20   Great joy we have this week in the weekly Bill, it being come to 544 in all, and but 333 of the plague; so that we are encouraged to get to London soon as we can.

1665-11-30 13:03   Comes Sir Thomas Allen, and I made him dine with me, and very friendly he is, and a good man, I think, but one that professes he loves to get and to save.

1665-11-29 22:32   Home to my house, calling my wife, where the poor wretch is putting things in a way to be ready for our coming home, and so by water together to Greenwich.

1665-11-29 06:50   Up, my wife and I talking how to dispose of our goods, and resolved upon sending our two maids Alce and Susan home.

1665-11-28 20:33   Down to Greenwich, and I to the office, where did a little business, and then to my lodgings, where my wife is come. We do resolve to remove home soon as we know how the plague goes this week, which we hope will be a good decrease.

1665-11-28 16:52   Captain Cocke and I through Wandsworth. Drank at Sir Allen Broderick’s, a great friend and comrade of Cocke’s, whom he values above the world for a witty companion, and I believe he is so.

1665-11-28 13:42   To Nonesuch, and thence to Sir Robert Long’s house; a fine place. We had a very good dinner, and curiously dressed, and here a couple of ladies, kinswomen of his, not handsome though, but rich, that knew me by report of The. Turner, and mighty merry we were.

1665-11-28 07:20   Thinking of some business, I did ’light at the foot of the bridge, and by help of a candle at a stall, I wrote a letter to Mr. Hater, and never knew so great an instance of the usefulness of carrying pen and ink and wax about one.

1665-11-28 07:03   Up before day, and Cocke and I took a hackney coach appointed with four horses to take us up, and so carried us over London Bridge.

1665-11-28 00:17   Comes to us Sir G. Smith and the Lieutenant of the Tower, and there they sat talking and drinking till past midnight, and mighty merry we were, the Lieutenant of the Tower being in a mighty vein of singing, and he hath a very good eare and strong voice, but no manner of skill.

1665-11-27 20:39   Cocke and I to Sir G. Smith’s, it being now night, and there up to his chamber and sat talking, and I barbing against to-morrow.

1665-11-27 17:45   Few people yet in the streets, nor shops open, here and there twenty in a place almost; though not above five or six o’clock at night.

1665-11-27 17:40   I into London, it being dark night, by a hackney coach; the first I have durst to go in many a day, and with great pain now for fear. But it being unsafe to go by water in the dark and frosty cold, and unable being weary with my morning walk to go on foot, this was my only way.

1665-11-27 13:05   Away to the Duke of Albemarle, and there to dinner, he most exceeding kind to me to the observation of all that are there.

1665-11-27 11:40   I to the Swan, and there found Sarah all alone in the house and I had the opportunity a hazer what I tena a mind á hazer con ella, only con my hands – but she was vexed at my offer a tocar la under sus jupes; but I did once, nonbstant all that.

1665-11-27 08:55   The Duke of Albemarle’s going, I hear, is upon putting the sea business into order, and, as some say, and people of his own family, that he is agog to go to sea himself the next year.

1665-11-27 00:13   I stayed alone talking and playing with Mrs. Penington till past midnight, she suffering me a hazer whatever ego voulus avec ses mamelles – and I had almost led her by discourse to make her tocar mi cosa naked, which ella did presque and did not refuse.

1665-11-26 21:12   I made them uninvite their guests, and to resolve of coming all away to me to-morrow, and I walked with a lanthorn, weary as I was, to Greenwich.

1665-11-26 20:50   They tell me one of the houses behind them is infected, and I was fain to stand there a great while, and was forced to pass by them again, close to their sick beds, which they were removing out of the house, which troubled me.

1665-11-26 20:22   I returned on foot to my wife at Woolwich, where I found, as I had directed, a good dinner to be made against to-morrow, and invited guests in the yard, meaning to be merry, in order to her taking leave, for she intends to come in a day or two to me for altogether.

1665-11-26 19:10   Away, Sir W. Warren riding with me, and the way being very bad, that is, hard and slippery by reason of the frost, so we could not come to past Woolwich till night.

1665-11-26 07:27   I borrowed two horses, and set out, after my horses being frosted (which I know not what it means), and my boy having lost one of my spurs and stockings, carrying them to the smith’s; but I borrowed a stocking, and so got up, and Mr. Tooker with me, and rode to Erith.

1665-11-25 17:08   All our business is now about our Hambro fleete, whether it can go or no this year, the weather being set in frosty, and the whole stay being for want of Pilotts now.

1665-11-24 17:28   Mr. Evelyn also showed us several letters of the old Lord of Leicester’s, under the very hand-writing of Queen Elizabeth, and Queen Mary, Queen of Scotts; and others, very venerable names. But, Lord! how poorly, methinks, they wrote in those days, and in what plain uncut paper.

1665-11-24 16:46   I visited Mr. Evelyn. Among other things he showed me a ledger of a Treasurer of the Navy, his great grandfather, just 100 years old; which I seemed mighty fond of, and he did present me with it, which I take as a great rarity.

1665-11-24 13:22   I went home with Sir G. Smith to dinner, sending for one of my barrels of oysters, which were good, though come from Colchester, where the plague hath been so much.

1665-11-24 10:04   At my old oyster shop in Gracious Streete, bought two barrels of my fine woman of the shop, who is alive after all the plague, which now is the first observation or inquiry we make at London concerning everybody we knew before it.

1665-11-23 21:40   Great expectation what mischief more the French will do us, for we must fall out.

1665-11-23 13:29   I sent for little Mrs. Frances Tooker, and after they were gone I sat dallying with her an hour, doing what I would with my hands about her. And a very pretty creature it is.

1665-11-23 12:36   Here come by chance Captain Cuttance, who tells me how W. Howe is laid by the heels, and confined to the Royall Katharine, and his things all seized.

1665-11-23 11:10   Sir H. Cholmly and I to walk in the park, and there discoursed with grief of the calamity of the times; how the King’s service is performed.

1665-11-23 09:04   It continuing to be a great frost, which gives us hope for a perfect cure of the plague.

1665-11-22 21:28   It pleased me to have it demonstrated, that a Purser without professed cheating is a professed loser, twice as much as he gets.

1665-11-22 11:57   This day the first of the Oxford Gazettes come out, which is very pretty, full of news, and no folly in it. Wrote by Williamson.

1665-11-22 10:36   I hear that the plague is come very low; that is, the whole under 1,000, and the plague 600 and odd: and great hopes of a further decrease, because of this day’s being a very exceeding hard frost, and continues freezing.

1665-11-22 08:48   By water to the Duke of Albemarle, and there did some little business, but most to shew myself, and mightily I am yet in his and Lord Craven’s books.

1665-11-21 22:14   I sent a long discourse to Mr. Coventry by his desire about the regulating of the method of our payment of bills in the Navy, which will be very good.

1665-11-20 18:49   Here I find Mr. Deering come to trouble me about business, he telling me that Luellin hath been dead this fortnight, of the plague, in St. Martin’s Lane, which much surprised me.

1665-11-20 18:14   By another way met with a very good road, but it rained hard and blew, but got home very well.

1665-11-20 13:40   I did get my tallys got ready, and thence, with as many as could go, to Yowell, and there dined very well, and I saw my Besse, a very well-favoured country lass there.

1665-11-20 09:45   Took horse for Nonesuch, with two men with me, and the ways very bad, and the weather worse, for wind and rain.

1665-11-19 19:22   We found my wife not well of them, and I out of humour begun to dislike her painting, the last things not pleasing me so well as the former, but I blame myself for my being so little complaisant.

1665-11-19 10:04   On board my Lord Bruncker, I find Captain Cocke and other company, the lady not well, and mighty merry we were; Sir Edmund Pooly being very merry, and a right English gentleman, and one of the discontented Cavaliers, that think their loyalty is not considered.

1665-11-19 08:39   After being trimmed, alone by water to Erith, all the way with my song book singing of Mr. Lawes’s long recitative song in the beginning of his book.

1665-11-18 11:20   I hired an ill-favoured horse, and away to Greenwich to my lodgings, where I hear how rude the souldiers have been in my absence, swearing what they would do with me, which troubled me.

1665-11-17 19:06   I left my Lord, and so away to my Bezan againe, and there to read in a pretty French book, “La Nouvelle Allegorique,” upon the strife between rhetorique and its enemies, very pleasant.

1665-11-17 16:50   The Duchesse herself is fallen in love with her new Master of the Horse, one Harry Sidney, and another, Harry Savill. So that God knows what will be the end of it.

1665-11-17 16:44   As an infinite secret, my Lord tells me, the factions are high between the King and the Duke, and all the Court are in an uproare with their loose amours; the Duke of Yorke being in love desperately with Mrs. Stewart.

1665-11-17 15:56   On board the Royall James spent an hour, my Lord playing upon the gittarr, which he now commends above all musique in the world, because it is base enough for a single voice, and is so portable and manageable without much trouble.

1665-11-17 08:22   My Lord and I on board Sir W. Pen; and there held a council of Warr about many wants of the fleet, but chiefly how to get slopps and victuals for the fleet.

1665-11-17 06:57   Sailed all night, and got down to Quinbrough water, where all the great ships are now come, and there on board my Lord, and was soon received with great content.

1665-11-16 16:28   Having seen this, which was as noble a sight as ever I saw in my life, I away on board the other ship in despair to get the pleasure-boat of the gentlemen there to carry me to the fleet.

1665-11-16 16:26   Pepper scattered through every chink, you trod upon it; and in cloves and nutmegs, I walked above the knees; whole rooms full. And silk in bales, and boxes of copper-plate, one of which I saw opened.

1665-11-16 16:24   I on board my Lord Bruncker; and there he and Sir Edmund Pooly carried me down into the hold of the India shipp, and there did show me the greatest wealth lie in confusion that a man can see in the world.

1665-11-16 10:37   I borrowed a horse of Mr. Boreman’s son, and after having sat an hour laughing with my Lady Batten and Mrs. Turner, and eat and drank with them, I took horse and rode to Eriffe.

1665-11-15 23:50   Mrs. Penington and I very civilly sat an hour by the fireside observing the folly of this Robinson, that makes it his work to praise himself, and all he say and do, like a heavy-headed coxcomb.

1665-11-15 13:39   The best jest was, that when the women saw themselves not regarded, they would go away; and my Lady Batten walking through the dirty lane with new spick and span white shoes, she dropped one of her galoshes in the dirt, where it stuck, and she forced to go home without one.

1665-11-15 13:36   After dinner who comes in but my Lady Batten, and a troop of a dozen women almost, and expected to be made mighty much of, but nobody minded them.

1665-11-15 12:44   Lord! to see how Sir W. Batten governs all and tramples upon Hurlestone, but I am confident the Company will grow the worse for that man’s death, for now Batten, and in him a lazy, corrupt, doating rogue, will have all the sway there.

1665-11-15 12:10   To the King’s Head taverne, where all the Trinity House dined to-day, to choose a new Master in the room of Hurlestone, that is dead, and Captain Crispe is chosen.

1665-11-14 23:35   I stopped my going, as I intended, to the buoy of the Nore, and great reason I had to rejoice at it, for it proved the night of as great a storme as was almost ever remembered.

1665-11-14 11:10   Calling at Mr. Rawlinson’s to know how all did there, I hear that my pretty grocer’s wife, Mrs. Beversham, over the way there, her husband is lately dead of the plague at Bow, which I am sorry for.

1665-11-13 21:46   Which methought was very strange, and I looked upon myself as a man mightily deceived in a lady, for I could not have thought Mrs. Penington could have suffered it, by her former discourse with me; so modest she seemed and I know not what.

1665-11-13 21:45   We drank and laughed, and Mrs. Penington willingly suffered me to put my hand in her bosom very wantonly, and keep it there long.

1665-11-13 20:32   Captain Cocke and I to Glanville’s, and there he and I sat talking and playing with Mrs. Penington, whom we found undressed in her smock and petticoats by the fireside.

1665-11-13 14:20   Captain Cocke and I walked into the garden, and there after a little discourse he did undertake under his hand to secure me in 500l. profit, for my share of the profit of what we have bought of the prize goods.

1665-11-12 21:34   By water to Captain Cocke’s, and there he and I spent a great deal of the evening as we had done of the day reading and discoursing over part of Mr. Stillingfleet’s “Origines Sacræ,” wherein many things are very good and some frivolous.

1665-11-12 15:05   Had a little discourse with the Duke of Albemarle, to receive his commands about pilotts to be got for our Hambro’ ships, going now at this time of the year convoy to the merchant ships, that have lain at great pain, some three, some four months at Harwich for a convoy.

1665-11-11 13:15   I up and to the office (leaving my wife in bed) and there till noon, then to dinner and back again to the office.

1665-11-10 22:10   Another neighbour of ours, Mr. Hollworthy, a very able man, is also dead by a fall in the country from his horse, his foot hanging in the stirrup, and his brains beat out.

1665-11-10 22:05   My wife told me that Mr. Harrington, our neighbour, an East country merchant, is dead at Epsum of the plague.

1665-11-10 21:47   News is brought me my wife is come. So I to her, and with her spent the evening, but with no great pleasure, I being vexed about her putting away of Mary in my absence.

1665-11-10 07:55   Entered all my Journall since the 28th of October, having every day’s passages well in my head, though it troubles me to remember it, and which I was forced to, being kept from my lodging, where my books and papers are, for several days.

1665-11-10 00:05   Going home W. Hewer did tell me my wife will be here to-morrow, and hath put away Mary, which vexes me to the heart. I think my wife means no ill design in it, or, if she do, I am a fool to be troubled at it, since I cannot help it.

1665-11-09 22:36   The Bill of Mortality, to all our griefs, is encreased 399 this week, and the encrease generally through the whole City and suburbs, which makes us all sad.

1665-11-09 14:12   But it is a strange thing to observe, they being the greatest enemies Captain Taylor had, and yet I believe hath, in the world in their hearts.

1665-11-09 14:10   Strange to see how a good dinner and feasting reconciles everybody, Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Robinson being now as kind to Captain Taylor, and report well of his ship and proceedings, and promise money, and Sir W. Batten is a solicitor for him.

1665-11-09 12:45   Sir John Robinson come in with a great deal of company from hunting, and brought in a hare alive and a great many silly stories they tell of their sport, which pleases them mightily, and me not at all, such is the different sense of pleasure in mankind.

1665-11-08 20:04   I did take water, being glad I was out of the town; for the plague, it seems, rages there more than ever.

1665-11-08 19:40   By water to Deptford, and there did order my matters so, walking up and down the fields till it was dark night, that je alloy à la maison of my valentine, and there je faisais whatever je voudrais avec her.

1665-11-08 11:13   It being a fast day, all people were at church and the office quiet; so I did much business.

1665-11-07 23:50   To my lodging and there spent the evening talking with Mrs. Penington, who is a very discreet, understanding lady and very pretty discourse we had and great variety.

1665-11-06 19:26   Sir G. Carteret and I did walk an hour in the garden, talking of my Lord Sandwich’s business; what enemies he hath, and how they have endeavoured to bespatter him.

1665-11-05 17:36   In fine, a most excellent person Mr. Evelyn is, and must be allowed a little for a little conceitedness; but he may well be so, being a man so much above others.

1665-11-05 17:21   Here comes in, in the middle of our discourse Captain Cocke, as drunk as a dog, but could stand, and talk and laugh. He did so joy himself in a brave woman that he had been with all the afternoon, and who should it be but my Lady Robinson.

1665-11-05 17:05   Mr. Evelyn showed me his Hortus Hyemalis; leaves laid up in a book of several plants kept dry, which preserve colour, however, and look very finely, better than any Herball.

1665-11-05 16:39   Mr. Evelyn read me part of a play or two of his making, very good, but not as he conceits them, I think, to be.

1665-11-05 16:06   To Mr. Evelyn, who showed me most excellent painting in little; in distemper, Indian incke, water colours, graveing; and, above all, the whole secret of mezzo-tinto, and the manner of it, which is very pretty, and good things done with it.

1665-11-05 13:38   To dinner, where a great deal of silly discourse, but the worst is I hear that the plague increases much at Lambeth, St. Martin’s and Westminster, and fear it will all over the city.

1665-11-05 09:50   I heard the Duke of Albemarle’s chaplain cried: “All our physicians cannot tell what an ague is, and all our arithmetique is not able to number the days of a man;” which, God knows, is not the fault of arithmetique, but that our understandings reach not the thing.

1665-11-04 17:50   I to the office, and much troubled to have 100 seamen all the afternoon there, swearing below and cursing us, and breaking the glass windows, and swear they will pull the house down.

1665-11-04 09:22   I sent Mr. Hater and W. Hewer to speak with the mother; but they returned to me, satisfied that there is no hurt nor danger, but the boy is well, and offers to be searched.

1665-11-04 08:37   To my office, my head a little akeing, partly for want of natural rest, partly having so much business to do to-day, and partly from the news I hear that one of the little boys at my lodging is not well; and they suspect that it may be the plague.

1665-11-03 21:42   With a brave gale and tide reached up to the Hope, taking great pleasure in learning the seamen’s manner of singing when they sound the depths.

1665-11-03 19:33   To dinner, where my Lord infinitely kind to me, and after dinner I rose and left him with some Commanders at the table taking tobacco.

1665-11-03 13:10   I found my Lord on board the Royall James, and with him an hour alone discoursing what was my chief and only errand about what was advisable for his Lordship to do in this state of things, himself being under the Duke of York’s and Mr. Coventry’s envy.

1665-11-03 08:45   Was called up about four o’clock and in the dark by lanthorn took boat and to the Ketch and set sail, sleeping a little in the Cabbin till day and then up and fell to reading of Mr. Evelyn’s book about Paynting, which is a very pretty book.

1665-11-02 12:58   I home to my lodgings to dinner, and there comes Captain Wagers newly returned from the Streights, who puts me in great fear for our last ships that went to Tangier with provisions, that they will be taken.

1665-11-01 21:42   This night we called upon Coll. Cleggatt, who tells us for certain that the King of Denmark hath declared to stand for the King of England, but since I hear it is wholly false.

1665-11-01 15:50   It being my Lord Bruncker’s birth-day, had every one a green riband tied in our hats very foolishly; and methinks mighty disgracefully for my Lord to have his folly so open to all the world with this woman.

1665-11-01 13:19   It being a very foul day for rain and a hideous wind, yet having promised I would go by water to Erith, and bearing sail was in danger of oversetting, but ordered them take down their sail, and so cold and wet got thither.

1665-11-01 07:40   Lay very long in bed discoursing with Mr. Hill of most things of a man’s life, and how little merit do prevail in the world, but only favour; and that, for myself, chance without merit brought me in; and that diligence only keeps me so.

1665-11-01 00:20   I in great hopes of my place of Surveyor-Generall of the Victualling, which will bring me 300l. per annum.

1665-11-01 00:15   Want of money in the Navy puts everything out of order. Men grow mutinous; and nobody here to mind the business of the Navy but myself.

1665-11-01 00:10   After some fears that the plague would have increased again this week, I hear for certain that there is above 400 less, the whole number being 1,388, and of them of the plague, 1,031.
