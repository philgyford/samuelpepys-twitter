1669-04-30 22:25 r Home, and there find my wife hath been making herself clean against tomorrow; and I did send my coachman and horses to fetch home the coach tonight, and so we to supper, myself most weary with walking and standing so much, to see all things fine against tomorrow, and so to bed.

1669-04-30 20:44 r Here I did make the workmen drink, and saw my coach cleaned and oyled; and, staying among poor people there in the alley, did hear them call their fat child Punch, which pleased me mightily that word being become a word of common use for all that is thick and short.

1669-04-30 20:04 r I to my coach-maker’s and saw the painter varnish which is pretty to see how every doing it over do make it more and more yellow; and most coaches are, now-a-days done so, and it is very pretty when laid on well, and not pale, as some are, even to show the silver.

1669-04-30 14:14 r To Lilly’s, the varnisher, about my prints, whereof some of them are pasted upon the boards, and to my full content. Thence to the frame-maker’s one Morris, in Long Acre, who showed me several forms of frames to choose by, in little bits of mouldings, to choose by.

1669-04-30 11:28 r I did visit Mr. Oldenburgh, and did see the instrument for perspective made by Dr. Wren, of which I have one making by Browne; and the sight of this do please me mightily.

1669-04-30 10:34 r So to the cutler’s, and there did give Tom, a sword cost me 12s. and a belt of my owne; and set my own silver-hilt sword a-gilding against tomorrow.

1669-04-30 09:29 r To the belt-maker’s, where my belt cost me 55s.; and here, understanding that the mistress of the house, an oldish woman, hath some water good for the eyes, she did dress me, making my eyes smart most horribly, and did give me a little glass of it, which I will use.

1669-04-30 08:34 r I to my coach, which is silvered over, but no varnish yet laid on, so I put it in a way of doing; and myself about other business.

1669-04-30 08:14   To the coachmaker’s: and there I do find a great many ladies sitting in the body of a coach that must be ended by tomorrow: they were my Lady Marquess of Winchester, Bellassis, and other great ladies; eating of bread and butter, and drinking ale.

1669-04-29 13:47   Up, and to the Office, where all the morning, and at noon dined at home, and then to the Office again, there to despatch as much business as I could, that I might be at liberty tomorrow to look after my many things that I have to do, against May-day.

1669-04-28 11:11   Mr. Sheres sent me, in two volumes, Mariana his History of Spaine, in Spanish, an excellent book; and I am much obliged for it to him.

1669-04-28 08:52 r But this a thing that will make the Parliament and kingdom mad, and will turn to our ruine: for with this money the King shall wanton away his time in pleasures, and think nothing of the main till it be too late.

1669-04-28 08:48   I find that for a sum of money we shall enter into a league with the King of France, and that this will so help the King that he will not need the Parliament; and that, in that regard it will be forwarded by the Duke of Buckingham and his faction, who dread the Parliament.

1669-04-27 22:10   Home, and got my wife to read to me in the Nepotisme, which is very pleasant, and so to supper and to bed.

1669-04-27 17:38   This afternoon was brought to me a fresh Distringas upon the score of the Tangier accounts which vexes me, though I hope it will not turn to my wrong.

1669-04-26 19:19   I did call at the coachmaker’s, and do resolve upon having the standards of my coach gilt with this new sort of varnish, which will come but to 40s.; and, contrary to my expectation, the doing of the biggest coach all over comes not to above 6l., which is not very much.

1669-04-26 16:12 r The King and Court were here, it seems, and stopped the fire by blowing up of the next house.

1669-04-26 16:10   I am told by Betty of a great fire happened in Durham-Yard last night, burning the house of one Lady Hungerford; and so the house is burned by carelessness of the girl sent to take off a candle from a bunch of candles, which she did by burning it off, and left the rest on fire.

1669-04-26 13:33   To dinner, and Mr. Sheres dined, with us, who come hither today to teach my wife the rules of perspective; but I think, upon trial, he thinks it too hard to teach her, being ignorant of the principles of lines.

1669-04-26 11:22   So to White Hall, and did a little business there at the Treasury chamber, and so homeward, calling at the laceman’s for some lace for my new suit, and at my tailor’s, and so home.

1669-04-26 10:18 r While I was there, a fire burst out in a chimney of a house over against his house, but it was with a gun quickly put out.

1669-04-26 10:05   By coach with W. Hewer to the Excise Office, and so to Lilly’s, the Varnisher; who is lately dead, and his wife and brother keep up the trade, and there I left my French prints to be put on boards.

1669-04-25 17:55   To the Park, where much company, and the weather pleasant. I carried my wife to the Lodge, the first time this year, and there in our coach eat a cheese-cake and drank a tankard of milk. I showed her also the Prince of Tuscany, who was in the Park, and many very fine ladies.

1669-04-25 14:30 r I to my Office, to write down my journal for the last twelve days: and did it with the help of my vizard and tube fixed to it, and do find it mighty manageable, but how helpfull to my eyes this trial will show me.

1669-04-25 09:20 r Up, and to my Office awhile, and thither comes Lead with my vizard, with a tube fastened within both eyes; which, with the help which he prompts me to, of a glass in the tube, do content me mightily.

1669-04-24 21:04   Well pleased tonight to have Lead, the vizard-maker, bring me home my vizard, with a tube fastened in it, which, I think, will do my business, at least in a great measure, for the easing of my eyes.

1669-04-24 13:23   Home, Mr. Sheres dining with us by agreement; and my wife, which troubled me, mighty careful to have a handsome dinner for him; but yet I see no reason to be troubled at it, he being a very civil and worthy man, I think; but only it do seem to imply some little neglect of me.

1669-04-23 18:59 r Nevertheless, we took him with us to our Mercer’s, and to the Exchange, and he helped me to choose a summer-suit of coloured camelott, coat and breeches, and a flowered tabby vest very rich; and so home.

1669-04-23 17:35 r Here, by accident, we met Mr. Sheres, and yet I could not but be troubled, because my wife do so delight to talk of him, and to see him.

1669-04-23 17:14 r To the King’s playhouse, and saw “The Generous Portugalls,” a play that pleases me better and better every time we see it; and, I thank God! it did not trouble my eyes so much as I was afeard it would.

1669-04-23 13:12 r The Council rising, I to Unthanke’s, and there by agreement met my wife, and with her to the Cocke, and did give her a dinner, but yet both of us but in an ill humour, whatever was the matter with her.

1669-04-23 10:45   To the Council-Chamber, and heard two or three causes: among others, that of the complaint of Sir Philip Howard and Watson, the inventors, as they pretend, of the business of varnishing and lackerworke, against the Company of Painters, who take upon them to do the same thing.

1669-04-23 06:50   Going to rise, my wife stopped me and, after a little angry talk, did tell me how she spent all day yesterday with M. Batelier and her sweetheart, and seeing a play at the New Nursery, which is set up at the house in Lincoln’s Inn Fields. So that I was mightily pleased again.

1669-04-23 01:07   Vexed at my wife’s not being come home, she being gone again abroad with M. Batelier, and come not home till ten at night, which vexed me, so that I to bed, and lay in pain awake till past one.

1669-04-22 13:47   Home to dinner, and Captain Deane with us; and good discourse, particularly about my getting a book for him to draw up his theory of shipping, which he hath gone far in, and hath shown me what he hath done therein. I did give him a Parallelogram, which he is mightily taken with.

1669-04-21 20:30 r So she, and Mrs. Turner, and The, and Talbot, in mine, and Joyce, W. Batelier, and I, in a hackney, to Hyde Park, where I was ashamed to be seen; but pleased, though troubled, with a drunken coachman that did not remember when we come to ’light, where it was that he took us up.

1669-04-21 17:40   My boy comes to tell me that his mistress was at the Gate with the coach, whither I went, and there find my wife and the whole company.

1669-04-21 13:55   Home, and thither by and by comes cozen Turner, and The., and Joyce, in their riding-clothes: they being come from their lodgings to her husband’s chamber, at the Temple, and there do lie, and purpose to go out of town on Friday next; and here I had a good dinner for them.

1669-04-21 10:15 r But, Lord! to see how he did with his admirable eloquence order the matter, is not to be conceived almost: so pleasant a thing it is to hear him plead.

1669-04-21 09:50   To White Hall; and so, by and by, to the Council-Chamber, and heard a remarkable cause pleaded between the Farmers of the Excise of Wiltshire, in complaint against the justices of Peace of Salisbury: and Sir H. Finch was for the former.

1669-04-21 08:05   Up; and with my own coach as far as the Temple, and thence sent it to my cozen Turner, who, to ease her own horses, that are going with her out of town, do borrow mine today.

1669-04-20 22:10   And so home to the Office, and there did some business, and then home, where my wife do come home, and I vexed at her staying out so late, but she tells me that she hath been at home with M. Batelier a good while, so I made nothing of it, but to supper and to bed.

1669-04-20 18:15 r With Captain Deane, taking a hackney coach, did go out towards Bow, and went as far as Stratford, and all the way talking of this invention, and he offering me a third of the profit of the invention; which, for aught I know, may prove matter considerable to us.

1669-04-20 16:38 r Against a gun more than as long and as heavy again, and charged with as much powder again, she carried the same bullet as strong to the mark, and nearer the mark, and is more easily managed, which is a thing so extraordinary as to be admired for the happiness of his invention.

1669-04-20 16:32 r When we come, did find that the trial had been made; and they going away with extraordinary report of the proof of his gun, which, from the shortness and bigness, they do call Punchinello. But I desired Colonel Legg to stay and give us a sight of her performance, which he did.

1669-04-20 16:12 r We walked to the Old Artillery-Ground near the Spitalfields, where I never was before, but now, by Captain Deane’s invitation, did go to see his new gun tryed, this being the place where the Officers of the Ordnance do try all their great guns.

1669-04-20 15:15 r And more extraordinary, manly discourse and opportunity of showing myself, and learning from others, I have not, in ordinary discourse, had in my life, they being all persons of worth, but especially Sir H. Capell.

1669-04-20 14:32   At noon comes my guest, Mr. Hugh May, and with him Sir Henry Capell, my old Lord Capel’s son, and Mr. Parker; and I had a pretty dinner for them; and both before and after dinner had excellent discourse; and showed them my closet and my Office, to their great content.

1669-04-20 11:50   My wife abroad with Mary Batelier, with our own coach, but borrowed Sir J Minnes’s coachman, that so our own might stay at home, to attend at dinner; our family being mightily disordered by our little boy’s falling sick the last night; and we fear it will prove the small-pox.

1669-04-19 22:15   And so away home, and there to do business, and my wife being come home we to talk and to sup, there having been nothing yet like discovery in my wife of what hath lately passed with me about Deb., and so with great content to bed.

1669-04-19 15:58   To Westminster Hall, and did beckon to Doll Lane, now Mrs. Powell, as she would have herself called, and went to her sister Martin’s lodgings, and I did talk and drink with Doll and hazer ella para tocar mi thing; and yo did the like para her, but did not the thing itself.

1669-04-19 14:35   I after dinner out again, and, calling for my coach, which was at the coachmaker’s, and hath been for these two or three days, to be new painted, and the window-frames gilt against May-day, went on with my hackney to White Hall.

1669-04-19 12:12   To Westminster Hall, and walked, expecting to have met Deb, but whether she had been there, and missing me went away, or is prevented in coming, and hath no mind to come to me (the last whereof, as being most pleasing, as showing modesty, I should be most glad of), I know not.

1669-04-19 08:50   With his wife, I, and my wife, had taken occasion to tell Tom that I did intend to give him 40l. for himself, and 20l. to his wife, towards their setting out in the world, and that my wife would give her 20l. more, that she might have as much to begin with as he.

1669-04-18 19:10   This being the first day of rain we have had many a day, the streets being as dusty as in summer, I forced to walk to my cozen Turner’s, and there find my wife newly gone home, which vexed me, and so I walked through the rain to the Temple, and there got a coach, and so home.

1669-04-18 18:05 r By and by comes the Prince of Tuscany to visit the Duke of York, and the Duchess; and I find that he do still remain incognito, and so intends to do all the time he stays here, for avoiding trouble to the King and himself, and expence also to both.

1669-04-18 17:30 r And by and by we were called in again, and nothing said to that business; but another begun, about the state of this year’s action, and our wants of money, as I had stated the same lately to our Treasurers; which I was bid, and did largely, and with great content, open.

1669-04-18 16:55 r And there, by and by, being called in, Mr. Williamson did read over our paper, which was in a letter to the Duke of York, bound up in a book with the Duke of York’s Book of Instructions. He read it well; and, after read, we were bid to withdraw, nothing being at all said to it.

1669-04-18 16:23 r I to White Hall, where we all met and did sign it and then to my Lord Arlington’s, where the King, and the Duke of York, and Prince Rupert, as also Ormond and the two Secretaries, with my Lord Ashly and Sir T. Clifton was.

1669-04-18 14:55   Up, and all the morning till 2 o’clock at my Office, with Gibson and Tom, about drawing up fair my discourse of the Administration of the Navy, and then, Mr. Spong being come to dine with me, I in to dinner, and then out to my Office again, to examine the fair draught.

1669-04-17 23:20 r It being late, I away and to my wife, and by hackney; home, and there, my eyes being weary with reading so much: but yet not so much as I was afeard they would, we home to supper and to bed.

1669-04-17 22:22 r He did bring out of his cabinet, and made me read it, an extract out of a book of my late Lord of Northumberland’s, so prophetic of the business of Chatham, as is almost miraculous. I did desire, and he did give it me to copy out, which pleased me mightily.

1669-04-17 21:55 r Having done this, we fell to other talk; he with great confidence telling me how matters go among our adversaries, in reference to the Navy, and that he thinks they do begin to flag.

1669-04-17 21:20 r He did approve my paper of the Administration of the Navy, only did bid me alter these words, “upon the rupture between the late King and the Parliament,” to these, “the beginning of the late Rebellion.”

1669-04-17 20:38   I away over the Park, it being now night, to White Hall, and there, in the Duchess’s chamber, do find the Duke of York; and, upon my offer to speak with him, he did come to me, and withdrew to his closet.

1669-04-17 19:47 r He tells me that the King will not give other answer about his coming to kiss his hands, than “Not yet.” But he says that this that he desires, of kissing the King’s hand, is only to show to the world that he is not discontented, and not in any desire to come again into play.

1669-04-17 19:03   I spent an hour with Sir W. Coventry reading over first my draught of the Administration of the Navy which he do like well; and so fell to talk of other things, and how basely and in what a mean manner the Duke of Buckingham hath proceeded against him — not like a man of honour.

1669-04-17 17:05 r It is still a good play, having not been acted for two or three years before; but I do miss Clun, for the Doctor. But more my eyes will not let me enjoy the pleasure I used to have in a play.

1669-04-17 13:35   Home to dinner, and there find Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, and he dined with us; and there hearing that “The Alchymist” was acted, we did go, and took him with us to the King’s house.

1669-04-16 21:55   To my business at the office, but was in great pain about yesterday, lest my wife should have sent her porter to enquire anything, though for my heart I cannot see it possible how anything could be discovered of it, but yet such is fear as to render me full of doubt and disgust.

1669-04-16 17:55 r This do trouble me; for it is as mean a thing, and so he says, as hath been upon the stage a great while; and Harris, who hath no part in it, did come to me, and told me in discourse that he was glad of it, it being a play that will not take.

1669-04-16 17:37 r Here I did meet with Shadwell, the poet, who, to my great wonder, do tell me that my Lord of Orrery did write this play, trying what he could do in comedy, since his heroique plays could do no more wonders.

1669-04-16 17:25 r After the play done, I into the pit, and there find my wife and W. Hewer; and Sheres got to them, which, so jealous is my nature, did trouble me, though my judgment tells me there is no hurt in it, on neither side.

1669-04-16 17:15 r The Office attended the Duke of York; and being despatched pretty soon, and told that we should not wait on the King, as intended, I to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there, in the 18d. seat, did get room to see three acts of the play; but it seemed to me but very ordinary.

1669-04-16 14:32   My wife being gone abroad with W. Hewer, to see the new play today, at the Duke of York’s house, “Guzman,” I dined alone with my people, and in the afternoon away by coach to White Hall.

1669-04-16 11:58   Up, and to my chamber, where with Mr. Gibson all the morning, and there by noon did almost finish what I had to write about the Administration of the Office to present to the Duke of York.

1669-04-15 15:58 r The. and Betty Turner in new flowered tabby gowns, and so we were pretty merry, only my fear upon me for what I had newly done, do keep my content in.

1669-04-15 15:45 r But, the truth is, there are so many bad pictures, that to me make the good ones lose much of the pleasure in seeing them.

1669-04-15 15:22 r To Povy’s, and thither I, and there they were all, and W. Batelier and his sister, and had dined; but I had good things brought me, and then all up and down the house, and mightily pleased to see the fine rooms.

1669-04-15 14:35 r When I come back to the place where I left my coach it was gone, I having staid too long, which did trouble me to abuse the poor fellow, so that taking another coach I did direct him to find out the fellow and send him to me.

1669-04-15 14:23 r I did give her in a paper 20s., and we did agree para meet again in the Hall at Westminster on Monday next; and so giving me great hopes by her carriage that she continues modest and honest, we did there part.

1669-04-15 14:07 r Without standing in the street desired her to follow me, and I led her into a little blind alehouse within the walls, and there she and I alone fell to talk and besar la and tocar su mamelles, but she mighty coy, and I hope modest.

1669-04-15 13:17 r I saw her, and she me, but she made no stop, but seemed unwilling to speak to me; so I away on, but then stopped and ’light, and after her and overtook her at the end of Hosier lane in Smithfield.

1669-04-15 13:04 r I away, and through Jewen Street, my mind, God knows, running that way, but stopped not, but going down Holborne hill, by the Conduit, I did see Deb. on foot going up the hill.

1669-04-15 12:22 r I to the place, and there, after walking up and down by the windmills, I did find her and talk with her, but it being holiday and the place full of people, we parted, leaving further discourse and doing to another time.

1669-04-15 09:55 r But to the office I must go and did, but coming thither I find Bagwell’s wife, who did give me a little note into my hand, wherein I find her para invite me para meet her in Moorfields this noon, where I might speak with her.

1669-04-15 09:20   To the Excise Office with W. Hewer, but found some occasion to go another way to the Temple, and I by Deb.’s direction did know whither in Jewen Street to direct my hackney coachman, to go thither to enquire whether Mrs. Hunt, her aunt, was in town, who brought word she was not.

1669-04-14 22:04   Home, and there to talk and to supper and to bed, all being very safe as to my seeing of poor Deb. yesterday.

1669-04-14 19:55 r But they do here talk mightily of my Lady Paulina making a good end, and being mighty religious in her lifetime; and hath left many good notes of sermons and religion; wrote with her own hand,  which nobody ever knew of; which I am glad of: but she was always a peevish lady.

1669-04-14 19:27 r Here they treat us like strangers, quite according to the fashion — nothing to drink or eat, which is a thing that will spoil our ever having any acquaintance with them; for we do continue the old freedom and kindness of England to all our friends.

1669-04-14 18:43 r We to Creed’s, and there find him and her together alone, in their new house, where I never was before, they lodging before at the next door, and a pretty house it is; but I do not see that they intend to keep any coach.

1669-04-14 17:40   Out with my own coach to the Duke of York’s play-house, and there saw “The Impertinents,” a play which pleases me well still; but it is with great trouble that I now see a play, because of my eyes, the light of the candles making it very troublesome to me.

1669-04-13 22:20 r So home to supper, where very sparing in my discourse, not giving occasion of any enquiry where I have been today, or what I have done, and so without any trouble tonight more than my fear, we to bed.

1669-04-13 20:40 r But my great pain is lest God Almighty shall suffer me to find out this girl, whom indeed I love, and with a bad amour, but I will pray to God to give me grace to forbear it.

1669-04-13 20:10 r So home to my wife, who is come home from Deptford. But, God forgive me, I hardly know how to put on confidence enough to speak as innocent, having had this passage today with Deb., though only, God knows, by accident.

1669-04-13 19:14 r Back home through Crutched Friars, and there saw Mary Mercer, and put off my hat to her, on the other side of the way, but it being a little darkish she did not, I think, know me well, and so to my office to put my papers in order.

1669-04-13 18:03 r But I did speak to her and she to me, and did get her para docere me ou she demeures now. And did charge her para say nothing of me that I had vu elle, which she did promise, and so with my heart full of surprize and disorder I away.

1669-04-13 17:49 r I presently could not refrain, but sent W. Hewer away to look for Mr. Wren, and I run after her and two women and a man, and she in her old clothes, and after hunting a little, find them in the lobby of the chapel below stairs, and there I observed she endeavoured to avoid me.

1669-04-13 17:30 r I away home, and there sent for W. Hewer, and he and I by water to White Hall to look among other things, for Mr. May, to unbespeak his dining with me tomorrow. But here being in the court-yard, God would have it, I spied Deb., which made my heart and head to work.

1669-04-13 14:44 r There being a good piece of cold roast beef upon the tables and one Margetts, a young merchant that lodges there, and is likely to marry a sister of hers, I staid and eat, and had much good conversation with her, who hath the vanity to talk of her great friends and father.

1669-04-13 13:24 r I took occasion to go back to this milliner’s, whose name I now understand to be Clerke; and there, her husband inviting me up to the balcony, to see the sight go by to dine at Clothworker’s-Hall, I did go up and there saw it go by.

1669-04-13 12:42 r I by hackney-coach to the Spittle, and heard a piece of a dull sermon to my Lord Mayor and Aldermen, and thence saw them all take horse and ride away, which I have not seen together many a-day; their wives also went in their coaches; and, indeed, the sight was mighty pleasing.

1669-04-13 11:50 r And there, meeting both him and her in the shop, I bought a pair of gloves, and fell to talk, and found so much freedom that I stayed there the best part of the morning till towards noon, with great pleasure, it being a holiday.

1669-04-13 09:50   At the Office a good while, and then, my wife going down the River to spend the day with her mother at Deptford, I abroad, and first to the milliner’s in Fenchurch Street, over against Rawlinson’s.

1669-04-12 22:10 r Home, and after sitting an hour, thrumming upon my viall, and singing, I to bed, and left my wife to do something to a waistcoat and petticoat she is to wear tomorrow.

1669-04-12 20:38 r Here he showed me the model of his houses that he is going to build in Cornhill and Lumbard Street; but he hath purchased so much there, that it looks like a little town, and must have cost him a great deal of money.

1669-04-12 19:50 r Coming home, we overtook Alderman Backewell’s coach and his lady, and followed them to their house, and there made them the first visit, where they received us with extraordinary civility, and owning the obligation.

1669-04-12 16:30 r He did soundly beat the soldier, and cut him over the head. Thence back to White Hall, mightily pleased, all of us, with this sight, and particularly this fellow, as a most extraordinary man for his temper and evenness in fighting.

1669-04-12 15:45 r Here we saw a prize fought between a soldier and country fellow, one Warrell, who promised the least in his looks, and performed the most of valour in his boldness and evenness of mind, and smiles in all he did, and we were all both deceived and infinitely taken with him.

1669-04-12 15:10 r By water to the Bear-Garden, and there happened to sit by Sir Fretcheville Hollis, who is still full of his vain-glorious and prophane talk.

1669-04-12 13:40 r To my wife at Unthanke’s, and with her was Jane, and so to the Cocke, where they, and I, and Sheres, and Tom dined, my wife having a great desire to eat of their soup made of pease, and dined very well.

1669-04-12 10:55 r I up and down the house, talking with this man and that, and: then meeting Mr. Sheres, took him to see the fine flower-pot I saw yesterday, and did again offer 20l. for it; but he insists upon 50l.

1669-04-12 09:20   To White Hall, where I of the whole Office attended the Duke of York at his meeting with Sir Thomas Allen and several flag-officers, to consider of the manner of managing the war with Algiers; and, it being a thing I was wholly silent in, I did only observe.

1669-04-11 22:10   To my office, and there set down my journal, with the help of my left eye through my tube, for fourteen days’ past; which is so much, as, I hope, I shall not run in arrear again, but the badness of my eyes do force me to it.

1669-04-11 17:15   I took my wife to St. James’s, and there carried her to the Queen’s Chapel, the first time I ever did it; and heard excellent music, but not so good as by accident I did hear there yesterday, as I went through the Park from White Hall to see Sir W. Coventry.

1669-04-11 15:55 r He do ask 70l. for it: I had the vanity to bid him 20l.; but a better picture I never saw in my whole life; and it is worth going twenty miles to see it.

1669-04-11 15:50 r He took us to his lodging close by, and did show us a little flower-pot of his doing, the finest thing that ever I saw in my life; the drops of dew hanging on the leaves, so as I was forced, again and again, to put my finger to it, to feel whether my eyes were deceived or no.

1669-04-11 14:32   My wife and I out by coach, and Balty with us, to Loton, the landscape-drawer, a Dutchman, living in St. James’s Market, but there saw no good pictures. But by accident he did direct us to a painter that was then in the house with him, a Dutchman, newly come over, one Evarelst.

1669-04-11 11:15   To Church; where Alderman Backewell’s wife, and mother, and boy, and another gentlewoman, did come, and sit in our pew; but no women of our own there, and so there was room enough.

1669-04-10 14:58   I hear by Mr. Seymour that Captain Trevanion do give it out every where that I did overrule the whole Court-martiall against him, as long as I was there; and perhaps I may receive, this time, some wrong by it: but I care not, for what I did was out of my desire of doing justice.

1669-04-09 16:08   To Westminster Hall, and I took occasion to make a step to Mrs. Martin’s, the first time I have been with her since her husband went last to sea, which is I think a year since but yo did now hazer con ella what I would, though she had ellos upon her; but yo did algo.

1669-04-09 14:15   Out again with W. Hewer to the Excise-Office, and to several places; among others, to Mr. Faythorne’s, to have seen an instrument which he was said to have, for drawing perspectives, but he had it not: but I did see his work-house, and the best things of his doing he had by him.

1669-04-09 10:05   By water to White Hall, and there, with the Board, attended the Duke of York, and Sir Thomas Allen with us (who come to town yesterday); and it is resolved another fleet shall go to the Streights forthwith, and he command it.

1669-04-08 21:10   To the office again till the evening, and then with my wife by coach to Islington, to pay what we owe there, for the late dinner at Jane’s wedding; and so round by Kingsland and Hogsden home, pleased with my wife’s singing with me, by the way.

1669-04-08 14:14   Going through Smithfield, I did see a coach run over the coachman’s neck, and stand upon it, and yet the man rose up, and was well after it, which I thought a wonder.

1669-04-08 09:52   To White Hall, to the King’s side, to find Sir T. Clifford, where the Duke of York come and found me, which I was sorry for, for fear he should think I was making friends on that side. But I did put it off the best I could, my being there.

1669-04-07 21:21   This day I do hear that Betty Turner is to be left at school at Hackney, which I am mightily pleased with; for then I shall, now and then, see her. She is pretty, and a girl for that, and her relations, I love.

1669-04-07 19:33 r Hither come Mr. Eden, who was in his mistress’s disfavour ever since the other night that he come in thither fuddled. But I did make them friends by my buffoonery, and bringing up a way of spelling their names, and mighty merry we were.

1669-04-07 18:40   To my cousin Turner’s, and thence with her and her daughters, and her sister Turner, I carrying Betty in my lap, to Talbot’s chamber at the Temple, where, by agreement, the poor rogue had a pretty dish of anchovies and sweetmeats for them.

1669-04-07 16:50 r But the King and Council did forbear to determine any thing it, till the other business of the title and privilege be decided which is now under dispute at law between them, whether Temple be within the liberty of the City or no.

1669-04-07 16:28   To the Council-Chamber and there heard the great complaint of the City, tried against the gentlemen of the Temple, for the late riot, when my Lord Mayor was there. But, upon hearing the whole business, the City was certainly to blame to charge them in this manner as with a riot.

1669-04-07 14:10 r Back again to the Cocke, and there find Mr. Turner, Betty, and Talbot Pepys, and they dined with myself Sir D. Gawden and Gibson, and mighty merry, this house being famous for good meat, and particularly pease-porridge.

1669-04-07 12:44   I to the New Exchange to talk with Betty, my little sempstress; and so to Mrs. Turner’s, to call them to dinner, but my wife not come, I back again, and was overtaken by a porter, with a message from my wife that she was ill, and could not come to us.

1669-04-07 12:05   To the Lords of the Treasury, where all the morning, and settled matters to their liking about the assignments on the Customes, between the Navy Office and Victualler, and to that end spent most of the morning there with D. Gawden.

1669-04-06 21:08   I home, and there come home my wife, who hath been with Batelier’s late, and been dancing with the company, at which I seemed a little troubled, not being sent for thither myself, but I was not much so, but went to bed well enough pleased.

1669-04-06 16:22   Middleton and I did in acquaint the Duke of York what we had observed in the late Court-martiall; and though he thinks not fit to revoke what is already done in this case, yet it shall bring forth some good laws in the behaviour of Captains to their under Officers.

1669-04-06 14:20   To the Excise Office about some business, and so back to the office and sat till late, and thence to Mr. Batelier’s to dinner, where my cozen Turner and both her daughters, and Talbot Pepys and my wife, and a mighty fine dinner.

1669-04-05 21:40 r Home, mightily pleased with the day’s work. This day come another new mayd, for a middle maid, her name I know not yet; and, for a cookmaid, we have, ever since Bridget went, used a blackmoore of Mr. Batelier’s, Doll, who dresses our meat well, and we mightily pleased with her.

1669-04-05 19:44 r Meeting The. Turner, Talbot, W. Batelier, and his sister, in a coach, we anon took them with us to the Mulberry Garden; and there, after a walk, to supper upon what was left at noon; and very good.

1669-04-05 17:10 r By the way, we overtook Captain Ferrers upon his fine Spanish horse, and he is a fine horse indeed; but not so good, I think, as I have seen some. He did ride by us most of the way, and with us to the Park, and there left us.

1669-04-05 16:34 r Took coach again, and went five or six miles towards Branford, the Prince of Tuscany, who comes into England only to spend money and see our country; and we met him, but the coach passing by apace, we could not see much of him but he seems a very jolly and good comely man.

1669-04-05 14:40 r This, and the discourse he did give us of Spain, and description of the Escuriall, was a fine treat. So we left other good things, that would keep till night, for a collation.

1669-04-05 14:15   To the Mulberry Garden, where Sheres is to treat us with a Spanish Olio, by a cook of his acquaintance that is there, that was with my Lord in Spain: and he did do it, and mighty nobly; and the Olio was indeed a very noble dish, such as I never saw better, or any more of.

1669-04-05 11:09   I spent a little time with Creed walking in the garden, and talking about our Office, and I did think he might do me a kindness to learn of him what the Duke of Buckingham and the faction do design touching me, and to instil good words concerning me, which I believe he will.

1669-04-04 22:20   Home, where got my wife to read to me; and so after supper to bed. The Queen-Mother hath been of late mighty ill, and some fears of her death.

1669-04-04 15:40   With Sir J. Minnes and T. Middleton to White Hall, by appointment; and at my Lord Arlington’s the Office did attend the King and Cabal, to discourse the further quantity of victuals fit to be declared for, which was 2,000 men for six months.

1669-04-04 11:04   To church, where Alderman Backewell’s wife, by my invitation with my head, come up with her mother, and sat with us, and after sermon I did walk with them home, and there left them.

1669-04-03 10:04   To the Council of War again: but the proceedings of the Commanders so devilishly bad, and so professedly partial to the Captain, that I could endure it no longer, but took occasion to pretend business at the Office, and away, and Middleton with me, who was of the same mind.

1669-04-02 22:05   This night I did bring home from the King’s potticary’s, in White Hall by Mr. Cooling’s direction, a water that he says did him mighty good for his eyes. I pray God it may do me good; but, by his description, his disease was the same as mine, and this do encourage me to use it.

1669-04-02 22:00   I home; and there find my wife not yet come home from Deptford, where she hath been all this day to see her mother, but she come and by, and so to talk, and supper, and to bed.

1669-04-02 18:40 r Mr. Chevins took me into the back stairs, and they with his friend, Mr. Fowkes, he did make me, with some others that he took in (among others, Alderman Bucknell) eat a pickled herring, the largest I ever saw, and drink variety of wines till I was almost merry.

1669-04-02 17:11 r I did see the young Duchess, a little child in hanging sleeves, dance most finely, so as almost to ravish me, her ears were so good: taught by a Frenchman that did heretofore teach the King, and all the King’s children, and the Queen-Mother herself, who do still dance well.

1669-04-02 16:32 r I did also give the Duke of York a short account of the history of the Navy, as to our Office, wherewith he was very well satisfied: but I do find that he is pretty stiff against their bringing in of men against his mind, as the Treasures were.

1669-04-02 16:05   To the Duke of York’s lodgings, whither he by his appointment come: and alone with him an hour in his closet, telling him mine and W. Coventry’s advice touching the present posture of the Navy, as the Duke of Buckingham and the rest do now labour to make changes therein.

1669-04-02 13:50   With W. Hewer to the Cocke, and there he and I dined alone with great content, he reading to me, for my memory’s sake, my late collections of the history of the Navy, that I might represent the same by and by to the Duke of York.

1669-04-01 17:22   Comes Commissioner Middleton’s coach and horses for us, and we went with it towards the Park, thinking to have met The. Turner and Betty, but did not; so turned back again to their lodging, and there found them and Mr. Batelier, and there, after a little talk, we took leave.

1669-04-01 16:30   Dr. Ball, the Parson of the Temple, did tell me a great many pretty stories about the manner of the Parsons being paid for their preaching at Paul’s heretofore, and now, and the ground of the Lecture, and heretofore the names of the founders thereof, which were many.

1669-04-01 15:10   To Sir W. Pen’s by invitation to dine; where my wife was, and my Lord Brouncker and his mistress, and Sir J. Minnes and his niece; and here a bad dinner, and little mirth, I being little pleased with my host. However, I made myself sociable.

1669-04-01 14:00 r I confess I was pretty high, which did not at least the young gentlemen Commander like; and Middleton did the like. But could not bring it to any issue this day.

1669-04-01 11:20 r But, Lord! to see what wretched doings there were among all the Commanders to ruin the Purser, and defend the Captain in all his rogueries, be it to the prejudice of the King or Purser, no good man could bear!

1669-04-01 09:40   With Colonel Middleton, at the desire of Rear-Admiral Kempthorne, the President, for our assisting them, to the Court-martiall on board a yacht in the River here, to try the business of the Purser’s complaints, Baker against Trevanion, his Commander, of “The Dartmouth.”
