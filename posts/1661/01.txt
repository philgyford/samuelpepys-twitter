1661-01-31 18:50   To my father’s to see my mother, who is pretty well after her journey from Brampton. She tells me my aunt is pretty well, yet cannot live long. My uncle pretty well too, and she believes would marry again were my aunt dead, which God forbid.

1661-01-31 17:20   To the Theatre, and there sat in the pit among the company of fine ladys, &c.; and the house was exceeding full, to see Argalus and Parthenia, the first time that it hath been acted: and indeed it is good, though wronged by my over great expectations, as all things else are.

1661-01-31 12:10   This morning with Mr. Coventry at Whitehall about getting a ship to carry my Lord’s deals to Lynne, and we have chosen the Gift.


1661-01-30 19:20   To my Lady Batten’s; where my wife and she are lately come back again from being abroad, and seeing of Cromwell, Ireton, and Bradshaw hanged and buried at Tyburn.

1661-01-30 17:10   I went home, and there understand that my mother is come home well from Brampton, and had a letter from my brother John, a very ingenious one, and he therein begs to have leave to come to town at the Coronacion.

1661-01-30 14:50 r And besides much discourse did please ourselves to see young Davis and Whitton, two of our clerks, going by us in the field, who we observe to take much pleasure together, and I did most often see them at play together.

1661-01-30 14:30   Sir W. Pen and I into Moorfields and had a brave talk, it being a most pleasant day.

1661-01-30 09:50   (Fast day). The first time that this day hath been yet observed. And Mr. Mills made a most excellent sermon, upon “Lord forgive us our former iniquities;” speaking excellently of the justice of God in punishing men for the sins of their ancestors.


1661-01-29 21:30 r Going away, Mr. Davis’s eldest son took up my old Lady Slingsby in his arms, and carried her to the coach, and is said to be able to carry three of the biggest men that were in the company, which I wonder at.

1661-01-29 21:20   To Mr. Turner’s house, where the Comptroller, Sir William Batten, and Mr. Davis and their ladies; and here we had a most neat little but costly and genteel supper, and after that a great deal of impertinent mirth by Mr. Davis, and some catches, and so broke up.

1661-01-29 16:50   After great patience and little expectation, from so poor beginning, I saw three acts of “The Mayd in ye Mill” acted to my great content.

1661-01-29 11:10   Mr. Moore making up accounts with me all this morning till Lieut. Lambert came, and so with them over the water to Southwark, and so over the fields to Lambeth, and there drank, it being a most glorious and warm day, even to amazement, for this time of the year.


1661-01-28 17:25 r Here, I sitting behind in a dark place, a lady spit backward upon me by a mistake, not seeing me, but after seeing her to be a very pretty lady, I was not troubled at it at all.

1661-01-28 17:20   To the Theatre, where I saw again “The Lost Lady,” which do now please me better than before.

1661-01-28 17:10 r After some talk of Cromwell, Ireton and Bradshaw’s bodies being taken out of their graves today, I went to Mr. Crew’s and thence to the Theatre, where I saw again “The Lost Lady,” which do now please me better than before.

1661-01-28 13:30   To Fleet Street, with my sword to Mr. Brigden (lately made Captain of the Auxiliaries) to be refreshed, and with him to an ale-house, where I met Mr. Davenport.


1661-01-27 22:00   To Sir W. Batten’s, where very merry, and here I met the Comptroller and his lady and daughter, and Mrs. Turner and her husband supped with us here (I having fetched my wife thither), and after supper we fell to oysters, and then Mr. Turner went and fetched some strong waters.

1661-01-27 16:20   Sir W. Pen and I an hour in the garden talking, and he did answer me to many things, I asked Mr. Coventry’s opinion of me, and Sir W. Batten’s of my Lord Sandwich, which do both please me.

1661-01-27 13:50   At dinner was very angry at my people’s eating a fine pudding (made me by Slater, the cook, last Thursday) without my wife’s leave.

1661-01-27 06:50   Letters come to me from Portsmouth, telling me that the Princess is now well, and my Lord Sandwich set sail with the Queen and her yesterday from thence for France.


1661-01-26 14:20   There dined with me this day both the Pierces and their wives, and Captain Cuttance, and Lieutenant Lambert, with whom we made ourselves very merry by taking away his ribbans and garters, having made him to confess that he is lately married.

1661-01-26 12:00   Comes one that had formerly known me and I him, but I know not his name, to borrow 5l. of me, but I had the wit to deny him.


1661-01-25 21:40   This night comes two cages, which I bought this evening for my canary birds, which Captain Rooth this day sent me.

1661-01-25 15:10   Mr. Hater and I to look upon the instructions of my Lord Northumberland’s, but we were interrupted by Mr. Salisbury’s coming in, who came to see me and to show me my Lord’s picture in little, of his doing. And truly it is strange to what a perfection he is come in a year’s time.


1661-01-24 13:50   There dined with me Sir William Batten and his lady and daughter, Sir W. Pen, Mr. Fox (his lady being ill could not come), and Captain Cuttance. The first dinner I have made since I came hither. This cost me above 5l., and merry we were – only my chimney smokes.


1661-01-23 21:50   I in my chamber all the evening looking over my Osborn’s works and new Emanuel Thesaurus Patriarchae. So late to bed, having ate nothing today but a piece of bread and cheese at the ale-house with Greatorex, and some bread and butter at home.

1661-01-23 17:00   To my bookseller’s, and for books, and to Stevens, the silversmith, to make clean some plate against tomorrow, and so home, by the way paying many little debts for wine and pictures, &c., which is my great pleasure.

1661-01-23 16:10 r With him to Gresham Colledge (where I never was before), and saw the manner of the house, and found great company of persons of honour there.

1661-01-23 14:40   Without dinner, went into the City, and there meeting with Greatorex, we went and drank a pot of ale. He told me that he was upon a design to go to Teneriffe to try experiments there.


1661-01-22 16:50 r And by the way in discourse tells me that the best way of beginning a sentence, if a man should be out and forget his last sentence (which he never was), that then his last refuge is to begin with an Utcunque.

1661-01-22 16:35 r And also to what perfection he hath now brought the art of memory; that he did lately to four eminently great scholars dictate together in Latin, upon different subjects of their proposing, faster than they were able to write, till they were tired.

1661-01-22 16:20   I met with Dr. Thomas Fuller, and took him to the Dog, where he tells me of his last and great book that is coming out: that is, his History of all the Families in England; and could tell me more of my own, than I knew myself.

1661-01-22 10:00 r It pleased me much now to come in this condition to this place, where I was once a petitioner for my exhibition in Paul’s School; and also where Sir G. Downing (my late master) was chairman, and so but equally concerned with me.

1661-01-22 09:50   To Mercer’s Chappell where we met with the King’s Councell for Trade, upon some proposals of theirs for settling convoys for the whole English trade, and that by having 33 ships settled by the King for that purpose, which indeed was argued very finely by many persons of honour.

1661-01-22 09:10   To the Comptroller’s house, where I read over his proposals to the Lord Admiral for the regulating of the officers of the Navy, in which he hath taken much pains, only he do seem to have too good opinion of them himself.


1661-01-21 22:22   This day many more of the Fifth Monarchy men were hanged.

1661-01-21 22:10   So home to supper and then to bed, having eat no dinner today.

1661-01-21 16:30   It is strange what weather we have had all this winter; no cold at all; but the ways are dusty, and the flyes fly up and down, and the rose-bushes are full of leaves, such a time of the year as was never known in this world before here.

1661-01-21 12:02 r We are glad of it, for it is a work that will much displease the poor seamen, and so we are glad to have no hand in it.

1661-01-21 10:20   Sir W. Batten, the Comptroller and I to Westminster, to the Commissioners for paying off the Army and Navy, where the Duke of Albemarle was; and we sat with our hats on, and did discourse about paying off the ships and do find that they do intend to undertake it without our help.


1661-01-20 22:20   After prayers to write down my journall for the last five days, and so to bed.

1661-01-20 16:30   My wife and I to Church in the afternoon, and that being done we went to see my uncle and aunt Wight.


1661-01-19 19:20 r From thence by link, and bought two mouse traps of Thomas Pepys, the Turner, and so went and drank a cup of ale with him, and so home and wrote by post to Portsmouth to my Lord.

1661-01-19 17:00   I went to the Theatre, where I saw “The Lost Lady,” which do not please me much. Here I was troubled to be seen by four of our office clerks, which sat in the half-crown box and I in the 1s. 6d.

1661-01-19 12:00   My Lady told me how Mr. Hetley is dead of the small-pox going to Portsmouth with my Lord.

1661-01-19 11:20 r The Treasurer did tell me that he did suspect Thos. Hater to be an informer of them in this work, which we do take to be a diminution of us, which do trouble me, and I do intend to find out the truth.

1661-01-19 11:15 r We walked up and down, and at last found Sir G. Carteret, whom I had not seen a great while, and did discourse with him about our assisting the Commissioners in paying off the Fleet, which we think to decline.

1661-01-19 10:50   To the Comptroller’s, and with him by coach to White Hall; in our way meeting Venner and Pritchard upon a sledge, who with two more Fifth Monarchy men were hanged today, and the two first drawn and quartered.


1661-01-18 21:50   Took home with me from the bookseller’s Ogilby’s Aesop, which he had bound for me, and indeed I am very much pleased with the book.

1661-01-18 21:00 r I took Mr. Hollier to the Greyhound, where he did advise me above all things, both as to the stone and the decay of my memory (of which I now complain to him), to avoid drinking often, which I am resolved, if I can, to leave off.

1661-01-18 20:10   I to see my father who I found well, and took him to Standing’s to drink a cup of ale. In comes Will Joyce to us drunk, and in a talking vapouring humour of his state, and I know not what, which did vex me cruelly.

1661-01-18 11:45   At home found all well, but the monkey loose, which did anger me, and so I did strike her till she was almost dead, that they might make her fast again, which did still trouble me more.

1661-01-18 11:00 r After a morning draft I took horse and guide for London; and through some rain, and a great wind in my face, I got to London at eleven o’clock.


1661-01-17 22:30 r We returned to our Inn and to bed, the page and I in one bed, and the two captains in another, all in one chamber, where we had very good mirth with our most abominable lodging.

1661-01-17 22:10 r We being merry, we bade my Lady goodnight, and intended to have gone to the Post-house to drink, and hear a pretty girl play of the cittern, but it was late, and we could not hear her, and the guard came to examine what we were.

1661-01-17 20:30 r We sat and talked till supper, and at supper my Lady and I entered into a great dispute concerning what were best for a man to do with his estate – whether to make his elder son heir, which my Lady is for, and I against, but rather to make all equall.

1661-01-17 16:50 r It begun to be dark before we could come to Dartford, and to rain hard, and the horses to fayle, which was our great care to prevent, for fear of my Lord’s displeasure, so here we sat up for tonight, as also Captains Cuttance and Blake, who came along with us.

1661-01-17 14:30 r We took coach, and I went into the coach, and went through the town, without making stop at our inn, but left J. Goods to pay the reckoning. So I rode with my lady in the coach, and the page on the horse that I should have rid on – he desiring it.

1661-01-17 11:50 r From thence on board the Newcastle, to show my Lady the difference between a great and a small ship. Among these ships I did give away 7l.

1661-01-17 11:00 r I confess it was a great pleasure to myself to see the ship that I begun my good fortune in.

1661-01-17 10:20 r After we had seen all, then the officers of the ship had prepared a handsome breakfast for her, and while she was pledging my Lord’s health they give her five guns. That done, we went off, and then they give us thirteen guns more.

1661-01-17 09:50 r From thence to the Charles, where my lady took great pleasure to see all the rooms, and to hear me tell her how things are when my Lord is there.

1661-01-17 09:10 r We went through Ham Creeke to the Soverayne (a goodly sight all the way to see the brave ships that lie here) first, which is a most noble ship. I never saw her before.


1661-01-16 18:30 r The sport was how she had intended to have kept herself unknown, and how the Captain (whom she had sent for) of the Charles had forsoothed her, though he knew her well and she him.

1661-01-16 18:00 r I found my Lady and her daughter Jem., and Mrs. Browne and five servants, all at a great loss, not finding me here, but at my coming she was overjoyed.

1661-01-16 17:10 r And thence to Rochester (I having good horses and good way, come thither about half-an-hour after daylight, which was before 6 o’clock and I set forth after two).

1661-01-16 14:05 r And so by boat home and put on my boots, and so over to Southwarke to the posthouse, and there took horse and guide to Dartford.

1661-01-16 11:40 r In this trouble, I went to take a walk in Westminster Hall and by chance met with Mr. Child, who went forth with my Lady today, but his horse being bad, he come back again, which then did trouble me more, so that I did resolve to go to her.

1661-01-16 10:10   I to my Lady; but coming to her lodgings I find that she is gone to Chatham by coach, thinking to meet me there, which did trouble me exceedingly, and I did not know what to do, being loth to follow her, and yet could not imagine what she would do when she found me not there.


1661-01-15 22:40 r By and by comes in my boy and tells me that his mistress do lie this night at Mrs. Hunt’s, who is very ill, with which being something satisfied, I went to bed.

1661-01-15 22:00 r Home, where my wife not yet come home, so I went up to put my papers in order, and then was much troubled my wife was not come, it being 10 o’clock just now striking as I write this last line.

1661-01-15 21:10 r I perceive none of our officers care much for one another, but I do keep in with them all as much as I can. Sir W. Pen is still very ill as when I went.

1661-01-15 20:50 r I went to see Sir W. Pen, and there found Mr. Coventry come to see him, and now had an opportunity to thank him, and he did express much kindness to me. I sat a great while with Sir Wm. after he was gone, and had much talk with him.

1661-01-15 20:00 r We walked to Dick-Shore, and thence to the Towre and so home. Where I found my wife and Pall abroad.

1661-01-15 15:10 r After a cup of burnt wine at the tavern there, we took barge and went to Blackwall and viewed the dock and the new Wet dock, which is newly made there, and a brave new merchantman which is to be launched shortly, and they say to be called the Royal Oak.

1661-01-15 14:30 r We walked to the waterside and in our way walked into the rope-yard, where I do look into the tar-houses and other places, and took great notice of all the several works belonging to the making of a cable.

1661-01-15 13:40   To dinner at Mr. Ackworth’s, where there also dined with us one Captain Bethell, a friend of the Comptroller’s. A good dinner and very handsome.

1661-01-15 12:00   Up and down the yard all the morning and seeing the seamen exercise, which they do already very handsomely.


1661-01-14 22:20   I with Mr. Ackworth to his house, where he has a very pretty house, and a very proper lovely woman to his wife, who both sat with me in my chamber, and they being gone, I went to bed, which was also most neat and fine.

1661-01-14 19:50   To Mr. Pett’s, the shipwright, and there supped, where he did treat us very handsomely (and strange it is to see what neat houses all the officers of the King’s yards have), his wife a proper woman, and has been handsome, and yet has a very pretty hand.

1661-01-14 16:30   Mrs. Pett, her husband being gone this morning with Sir W. Batten to Chatham, lent us her coach, and carried us to Woolwich, where we did also dispose of the arms there and settle the guards.

1661-01-14 11:50   I spent much time walking with Lieutenant Lambert, walking up and down the yards, who did give me much light into things there.

1661-01-14 10:50   The arms being come this morning from the Tower, we caused them to be distributed.


1661-01-13 23:40 r But all being quiet there, we caused the seamen to go on board again: And so we all to bed (after I had sat awhile with Mr. Davis in his study, which is filled with good books and some very good song books) I likewise to bed.

1661-01-13 22:55 r At last we hear that it was only five or six men that did ride through the guard in the town, without stopping to the guard that was there; and, some say, shot at them.

1661-01-13 22:30   No sooner in bed, but we had an alarm, and so we rose: and the Comptroller comes into the Yard to us; and seamen of all the ships present repair to us, and there we armed with every one a handspike, with which they were as fierce as could be.

1661-01-13 15:40 r With him and his wife and daughter-in-law by coach to Greenwich Church, where a good sermon, a fine church, and a great company of handsome women.

1661-01-13 12:10 r With Commissioner Pett to his lodgings there (which he hath for the present while he is building the King’s yacht, which will be a pretty thing, and much beyond the Dutchman’s).

1661-01-13 11:00   We all went to church, and sat in the pew belonging to us, where a cold sermon of a young man that never had preached before.


1661-01-12 20:00 r I went home with Mr. Davis, storekeeper (whose wife is ill and so I could not see her), and was there most prince-like lodged, with so much respect and honour that I was at a loss how to behave myself.

1661-01-12 14:10 r We dined at the Globe, having our messenger with us to take care for us. Never till now did I see the great authority of my place, all the captains of the fleet coming cap in hand to us.

1661-01-12 11:30 r And so on foot to Deptford (our servants by water), where we fell to choosing four captains to command the guards, and choosing the places where to keep them, and other things in order thereunto.

1661-01-12 09:10   With Colonel Slingsby and a friend of his, Major Waters (a deaf and most amorous melancholy gentleman, who is under a despayr in love, as the Colonel told me, which makes him bad company, though a most good-natured man), by water to Redriffe.


1661-01-11 20:10 r To the Coffeehouse, where I met Captain Morrice, the upholster, who would fain have lent me a horse tonight to have rid with him upon the Cityguards, with the Lord Mayor, there being some new expectations of these rogues; but I refused by reason of my going out of town tomorrow.

1661-01-11 19:00   Walked to Paul’s Churchyard, and bespoke some books against next week.

1661-01-11 13:50   Dined at home, discontented that my wife do not go neater now she has two maids.

1661-01-11 11:25 r And so was forced to come back again into Portsmouth harbour; and in their way, by negligence of the pilot, run upon the Horse sand. This news do make people think something indeed, that three of the Royal Family should fall sick of the same disease, one after another.

1661-01-11 11:20   Comes news, by letters from Portsmouth, that the Princess Henrietta is fallen sick of the meazles on board the London, after the Queen and she was under sail.


1661-01-10 19:20 r Their word was, “The King Jesus, and the heads upon the gates.” Few would receive any quarter, but such as were taken by force and kept alive; expecting Jesus to come here and reign in the world presently and will not believe but their work will be carried on though they do die.

1661-01-10 19:08 r Whereas we did believe them (because they were seen in every place almost in the City, and had been about Highgate two or three days, and in several other places) to be at least 500. A thing that never was heard of, that so few men should dare and do so much mischief.

1661-01-10 19:03 r … routed all the Trainbands that they met with, put the King’s life-guards to the run, killed about twenty men, broke through the City gates twice; and all this in the day-time, when all the City was in arms; are not in all about 31.

1661-01-10 19:00 r Among other things Mr. Davis told us the particular examinations of these Fanatiques that are taken: and in short it is this, of all these Fanatiques that have done all this, viz.…

1661-01-10 15:40   I went with my wife to see Sir W. Pen, who we found ill still, but he do make very much of it. Here we sat a great while, at last comes in Mr. Davis and his lady (who takes it very ill that my wife never did go to see her), and so we fell to talk.

1661-01-10 14:10   So to Mrs. Hunt, where I found a Frenchman, a lodger of hers, at dinner, and just as I came in was kissing my wife, which I did not like, though there could not be any hurt in it.

1661-01-10 13:40   Will comes to tell me that he had presented my piece of plate to Mr. Coventry, who takes it very kindly, and sends me a very kind letter, and the plate back again; of which my heart is very glad.

1661-01-10 10:50 r So we both went forth (calling first to see how Sir W. Pen do, whom I found very ill), and at the Hoop by the bridge we drank two pints of wormwood and sack. Talking of his wooing afresh of Mrs. Lane, and of his going to serve the Bishop of London.

1661-01-10 09:40   There comes Mr. Hawley to me and brings me my money for the quarter of a year’s salary of my place under Downing that I was at sea. So I did give him half, whereof he did in his nobleness give the odd 5s. to my Jane.


1661-01-09 22:50 r Home to my lute till late, and then to bed, there being strict guards all night in the City, though most of the enemies, they say, are killed or taken.

1661-01-09 20:00 r I found him at home and his wife, and I can see they have taken my absence ill, but all things are past and we good friends, and here I sat with my aunt, my uncle going forth about business. My aunt being very fearful to be alone.

1661-01-09 13:20 r Home, and dined at home, my father with me, and after dinner he would needs have me go to my uncle Wight’s (where I have been so long absent that I am ashamed to go).

1661-01-09 12:00 r Seeing the city in this condition, the shops shut, and all things in trouble, I went home and sat, it being office day.

1661-01-09 08:05 r In our way, the streets full of Train-band, and great stories, what mischief these rogues have done; and I think near a dozen have been killed this morning on both sides.

1661-01-09 07:50 r I went to the door, where I found Sir R. Ford, and with him I walked up and down as far as the Exchange, and there I left him.

1661-01-09 06:35 r So I returned (though with no good courage at all, but that I might not seem to be afeared), and got my sword and pistol, which, however, I had no powder to charge.

1661-01-09 06:00   Waked by people running up and down in Mr. Davis’s house, talking that the Fanatiques were up in arms in the City. And so I rose and went forth; where in the street I found every body in arms at the doors.


1661-01-08 21:40   Some talk today of a head of Fanatiques that do appear about Barnett, but I do not believe it. However, my Lord Mayor, Sir Richd. Browne, hath carried himself very honourably, and hath caused one of their meeting-houses in London to be pulled down.

1661-01-08 18:10 r My Lord’s coach waited for us, and so back to my Lady’s, where she made me drink of some Florence wine, and did give me two bottles for my wife.

1661-01-08 16:30   I took my Lord Hinchinbroke and Mr. Sidney to the Theatre, and showed them “The Widdow,” an indifferent good play, but wronged by the women being to seek in their parts.

1661-01-08 09:40   My wife and I lay very long in bed talking and pleasing one another in discourse.

1661-01-07 17:00   After dinner (leaving 12d. with the servants to buy a cake with at night, this day being kept as Twelfth day) Tom and I and my wife to the Theatre, and there saw “The Silent Woman.” The first time that ever I did see it, and it is an excellent play.

1661-01-04 08:10   To the Jewell Office, to choose a piece of gilt plate for my Lord, in return of his offering to the King (which it seems is usual at this time of year, and an Earl gives twenty pieces in gold in a purse to the King).
