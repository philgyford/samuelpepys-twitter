1661-04-30 22:20 r I am sorry that I am not at London, to be at Hide-parke tomorrow, among the great gallants and ladies, which will be very fine.

1661-04-30 19:10 r We were very merry, having this day no other extraordinary rencontre, but my hat falling off my head at Newington into the water, by which it was spoiled, and I ashamed of it.

1661-04-30 10:00 r We got a small bait at Leatherhead, and so to Godlyman.

1661-04-30 08:40   After order given to my workmen, my wife and I and Mr. Creed took coach, and in Fishstreet took up Mr. Hater and his wife, who through her mask seemed at first to be an old woman, but afterwards I found her to be a very pretty modest black woman.

1661-04-30 00:30 r So home and to bed, where my wife had not lain a great while.


1661-04-29 23:50   To Sir W. Batten’s, and by his and Sir W. Pen’s persuasion I sent for my wife from my father’s, who came to us to Mrs. Turner’s, where we were all at a collacion, there being a gentlewoman there that did play well and sang well to the Harpsicon, and very merry we were.

1661-04-29 15:00   Home again, and gave order to my workmen what to do in my absence.

1661-04-29 10:10   To the office, where it is determined that I should go tomorrow to Portsmouth.

1661-04-29 09:20   Met with Lieut. Lambert, and with him to the Dolphin in Tower Street and drank our morning draught, he being much troubled about his being offered a fourth rate ship to be Lieutenant of her now he has been two years Lieutenant in a first rate.


1661-04-28 20:35 r Which I was ashamed to hear that my mother should be become such a fool, and my father bid me to take notice of it to my mother, and to make peace between him and her. All which do trouble me very much.

1661-04-28 20:30   My father told me of an odd passage the other night in bed between my mother and him, and she would not let him come to bed to her out of jealousy of him and an ugly wench that lived there lately, the most ill-favoured slut that ever I saw in my life.


1661-04-27 21:30 r To the Cock alehouse, where we had a harp and viallin played to us, and so home by coach to Sir W. Batten’s, who seems so inquisitive when my house will be made an end of that I am troubled to go thither.

1661-04-27 17:10   Dined with my Lady, and after dinner with Mr. Creed and Captain Ferrers to the Theatre to see “The Chances.”


1661-04-26 21:00   Having some thoughts to order my business so as to go to Portsmouth the next week with Sir Robert Slingsby.

1661-04-26 12:40   At the office all the morning, and dined by myself at home on a piece of meat from the cook’s.


1661-04-25 13:40   Mr. Moore and I went to an Ordinary at the King’s Head in Towre Street, and there had a dirty dinner.

1661-04-25 11:50   All the morning with my workmen with great pleasure to see them near coming to an end.


1661-04-24 22:10 r So to bed.

1661-04-24 21:20 r Set myself to write down these three days’ diary, and while I am about it, I hear the noise of the chambers, and other things of the fire-works, which are now playing upon the Thames before the King; and I wish myself with them, being sorry not to see them.

1661-04-24 14:40 r After dinner home, and advised with my wife about ordering things in my house, and then she went away to my father’s to lie, and I staid with my workmen, who do please me very well with their work.

1661-04-24 13:10 r My wife and I went to dinner to Sir W. Batten, and all our talk about the happy conclusion of these last solemnities.

1661-04-24 08:40 r So rose and went out with Mr. Creed to drink our morning draft, which he did give me in chocolate to settle my stomach. And after that I to my wife, who lay with Mrs. Frankelyn at the next door to Mrs. Hunt’s.

1661-04-24 07:10 r When I waked I found myself wet with my spewing. Waked with my head in a sad taking through the last night’s drink, which I am very sorry for.


1661-04-23 23:55 r Now, after all this, I can say that, besides the pleasure of the sight of these glorious things, I may now shut my eyes against any other objects, nor for the future trouble myself to see things of state and show, as being sure never to see the like again in this world.

1661-04-23 23:50 r Thus did the day end with joy every where; I have not heard of any mischance to any body through it all, but only to Serjt. Glynne, whose horse fell upon him yesterday, and is like to kill him, which people do please themselves to see how just God is to punish the rogue.

1661-04-23 23:40 r But no sooner a-bed with Mr. Shepley but my head began to hum, and I to vomit, and if ever I was foxed it was now.

1661-04-23 23:20 r Mr. Hunt and I went in with Mr. Thornbury to his house; and there, with his wife and two of his sisters, and some gallant sparks that were there, we drank the King’s health, and nothing else, till one of the gentlemen fell down stark drunk, and there lay spewing.

1661-04-23 22:15 r They laid hold of us, and would have us drink the King’s health upon our knees, kneeling upon a faggot, which we all did, they drinking to us. Which we thought a strange frolique; but these gallants continued thus a great while, and I wondered to see how the ladies did tipple.

1661-04-23 22:00 r I took my wife and Mrs. Frankleyn (who I proffered the civility of lying with my wife at Mrs. Hunt’s tonight) to Axe-yard, in which at the further end there were three great bonfires, and a great many great gallants, men and women.

1661-04-23 21:55 r I went to Kingstreet, and there sent Crockford to my father’s and my house, to tell them I could not come home tonight, because of the dirt, and a coach could not be had.

1661-04-23 21:40 r At Mr. Bowyer’s, a great deal of company, some I knew, others I did not. Here we staid upon the leads and below till it was late, expecting to see the fire-works, but they were not performed tonight: only the City had a light like a glory round about it with bonfires.

1661-04-23 18:55 r Which people did take great notice of; God’s blessing of the work of these two days, which is a foolery to take too much notice of such things.

1661-04-23 18:50 r Strange it is to think that these two days have held up fair till now that all is done, and the King gone out of the Hall; and then it fell a-raining and thundering and lightening as I have not seen it do for some years.

1661-04-23 17:55 r I went up to my wife, and there met with a pretty lady (Mrs. Frankleyn, a Doctor’s wife, a friend of Mr. Bowyer’s), and kissed them both, and by and by took them down to Mr. Bowyer’s.

1661-04-23 17:40 r I took a great deal of pleasure to go up and down, and look upon the ladies, and to hear the musique of all sorts, but above all, the 24 violins.

1661-04-23 17:25 r And at the Lords’ table, I met with William Howe, and he spoke to my Lord for me, and he did give me four rabbits and a pullet, and so I got it and Mr. Creed and I got Mr. Michell to give us some bread, and so we at a stall eat it, as every body else did what they could get.

1661-04-23 17:10 r At last when he is come, the King drinks to him, and then sends him the cup which is of gold, and he drinks it off, and then rides back again with the cup in his hand.

1661-04-23 16:40 r And a Herald proclaims “That if any dare deny Charles Stewart to be lawful King of England, here was a Champion that would fight with him;” and with these words, the Champion flings down his gauntlet, and all this he do three times in his going up towards the King’s table.

1661-04-23 16:10 r Above all, was these three Lords, Northumberland, and Suffolk, and the Duke of Ormond, coming before the courses on horseback, and staying so all dinner-time, and at last to bring up the King’s Champion, all in armour on horseback, with his spear and targett carried before him.

1661-04-23 15:40 r And many fine ceremonies there was of the Heralds leading up people before him, and bowing; and my Lord of Albemarle’s going to the kitchin and eat a bit of the first dish that was to go to the King’s table.

1661-04-23 15:25 r And after a long time, he got up to the farther end, and all set themselves down at their several tables; and that was also a brave sight: and the King’s first course carried up by the Knights of the Bath.

1661-04-23 15:10 r And the King came in with his crown on, and his sceptre in his hand, under a canopy borne up by six silver staves, carried by Barons of the Cinque Ports, and little bells at every end.

1661-04-23 14:55 r Here I staid walking up and down, and at last upon one of the side stalls I stood and saw the King come in with all the persons (but the soldiers) that were yesterday in the cavalcade; and a most pleasant sight it was to see them in their several robes.

1661-04-23 14:40 r Into the Hall I got, where it was very fine with hangings and scaffolds one upon another full of brave ladies; and my wife in one little one, on the right hand.

1661-04-23 14:10 r But I had so great a lust to pisse that I went out a little while before the King had done all his ceremonies, and went round the Abbey to Westminster Hall, all the way within rayles, and 10,000 people, with the ground covered with blue cloth; and scaffolds all the way.

1661-04-23 13:55 r But so great a noise that I could make but little of the musique; and indeed, it was lost to every body.

1661-04-23 13:40 r And a Generall Pardon also was read by the Lord Chancellor, and meddalls flung up and down by my Lord Cornwallis, of silver, but I could not come by any.

1661-04-23 13:25 r And three times the King at Arms went to the three open places on the scaffold, and proclaimed, that if any one could show any reason why Charles Stewart should not be King of England, that now he should come and speak.

1661-04-23 12:55 r The crown being put upon his head, a great shout begun, and he came forth to the throne, and there passed more ceremonies: as taking the oath, and having things read to him by the Bishop; and his lords and bishops come, and kneeled before him.

1661-04-23 12:40 r And after all had placed themselves, there was a sermon and the service; and then in the Quire at the high altar, the King passed through all the ceremonies of the Coronacon, which to my great grief I and most in the Abbey could not see.

1661-04-23 12:25 r The King in his robes, bare-headed, which was very fine.

1661-04-23 12:10 r Then the Duke, and the King with a scepter (carried by my Lord Sandwich) and sword and mond before him, and the crown too.

1661-04-23 11:55 r At last comes in the Dean and Prebends of Westminster, with the Bishops (many of them in cloth of gold copes), and after them the Nobility, all in their Parliament robes, which was a most magnificent sight.

1661-04-23 11:25 r And a great pleasure it was to see the Abbey raised in the middle, all covered with red, and a throne (that is a chair) and footstool on the top of it; and all the officers of all kinds, so much as the very fidlers, in red vests.

1661-04-23 11:10 r With much ado, by the favour of Mr. Cooper, his man, did get up into a great scaffold across the North end of the Abbey, where with a great deal of patience I sat from past 4 till 11 before the King came in.

1661-04-23 04:40 r I rose and got to the Abbey, where I followed Sir J. Denham, the Surveyor, with some company that he was leading in.


1661-04-22 19:20 r By water to White Hall to my Lord’s, and there I spoke with my Lord. He talked with me about his suit, which was made in France, and cost him 200l., and very rich it is with embroidery.

1661-04-22 18:00 r So home, where Will and the boy staid and saw the show upon Towre Hill, and Jane at T. Pepys’s, the Turner, and my wife at Charles Glassecocke’s, in Fleet Street.

1661-04-22 15:30 r Sir W. Batten going home, he and I called and drunk some mum and laid our wager about my Lady Faulconbridge’s name, which he says not to be Mary, and so I won above 20s.

1661-04-22 13:20 r The show being ended, Mr. Young did give us a dinner, at which we were very merry, and pleased above imagination at what we have seen.

1661-04-22 11:45 r Both the King and the Duke of York took notice of us, as he saw us at the window.

1661-04-22 11:30 r So glorious was the show with gold and silver, that we were not able to look at it, our eyes at last being so much overcome with it.

1661-04-22 11:00 r The streets all gravelled, and the houses hung with carpets before them, made brave show, and the ladies out of the windows, one of which over against us I took much notice of, and spoke of her, which made good sport among us.

1661-04-22 10:30 r There followed the Vice-Chamberlain, Sir G. Carteret, a company of men all like Turks; but I know not yet what they are for.

1661-04-22 10:15 r The King, in a most rich embroidered suit and cloak, looked most noble. Wadlow, the vintner, at the Devil; in Fleetstreet, did lead a fine company of soldiers, all young comely men, in white doublets.

1661-04-22 10:00 r My Lord Monk rode bare after the King, and led in his hand a spare horse, as being Master of the Horse.

1661-04-22 09:45 r The Bishops come next after Barons, which is the higher place; which makes me think that the next Parliament they will be called to the House of Lords.

1661-04-22 09:30 r Embroidery and diamonds were ordinary among them. The Knights of the Bath was a brave sight of itself; and their Esquires, among which Mr. Armiger was an Esquire to one of the Knights. Remarquable were the two men that represent the two Dukes of Normandy and Aquitane.

1661-04-22 09:25 r In which it is impossible to relate the glory of this day, expressed in the clothes of them that rid, and their horses and horses clothes, among others, my Lord Sandwich’s.

1661-04-22 09:20 r Being ready, Sir W. Batten, my Lady, and his two daughters and his son and wife, and Sir W. Pen and his son and I, went to Mr. Young’s, the flag-maker, in Corne-hill;2 and there we had a good room to ourselves, with wine and good cake, and saw the show very well.

1661-04-22 06:30   Up early and made myself as fine as I could, and put on my velvet coat, the first day that I put it on, though made half a year ago.


1661-04-21 21:10   My mind a little troubled about my workmen, which, being foreigners, are like to be troubled by a couple of lazy rogues that worked with me the other day, that are citizens, and so my work will be hindered, but I must prevent it if I can.

1661-04-21 17:50 r So home, people being at church, and I got home unseen, and so up to my chamber and saw done these last five or six days’ diarys.

1661-04-21 15:40 r I went home, and all the way is so thronged with people to see the triumphal arches, that I could hardly pass for them.

1661-04-21 13:30 r Here dined Doctor Thos. Pepys and Dr. Fayrebrother; and all our talk about tomorrow’s show, and our trouble that it is like to be a wet day.

1661-04-21 11:20   I walked to my father’s and there found the late maid to be gone and another come by my mother’s choice, which my father do not like, and so great difference there will be between my father and mother about it.

1661-04-21 09:50   We were troubled to hear it rain as it did, because of the great show tomorrow.


1661-04-20 23:50 r The ways being now so dirty, and stopped up with the rayles which are this day set up in the streets, I would not go home, but went with him to Mr. Creed’s lodging at Mr. Ware’s.

1661-04-20 22:20 r And so saw “The Humersome Lieutenant” acted before the King, but not very well done. But my pleasure was great to see the manner of it, and so many great beauties, but above all Mrs. Palmer, with whom the King do discover a great deal of familiarity.

1661-04-20 19:20   With Mr. Creed to the Exchange and bought some things, as gloves and bandstrings, &c. So back to the Cockpitt, and there, by the favour of one Mr. Bowman, he and I got in, and there saw the King and Duke of York and his Duchess (which is a plain woman, and like her mother).

1661-04-20 17:40 r That being done (which was very pleasant to see their habits), I carried my Lady back, and I found my Lord angry, for that his page had let my Lord’s new beaver be changed for an old hat.

1661-04-20 16:12 r The first being led up by Heralds and five old Earls to the King, and there the patent is read, and the King puts on his vest, and sword, and coronet, and gives him the patent. And then he kisseth the King’s hand, and rises and stands covered before the king.

1661-04-20 16:10 r With my Lady and my Lady Wright to White Hall; and in the Banqueting-house saw the King create my Lord Chancellor and several others, Earls, and Mr. Crew and several others, Barons.

1661-04-20 14:10   To my Lord’s, where Sir W. Pen came to me, and dined with my Lord. After dinner he and others that dined there went away, and then my Lord looked upon his pages’ and footmen’s liverys, which are come home today, and will be handsome, though not gaudy.

1661-04-20 10:30 r The Duke comes; and after he had told us that the fleet was designed for Algier (which was kept from us till now), we did advise about many things as to the fitting of the fleet, and so went away.

1661-04-20 10:15 r Then he sent us to his closett, where we saw among other things two very fine chests, covered with gold and Indian varnish, given him by the East Indy Company of Holland.

1661-04-20 09:40 r So I went by water to Mr. Coventry’s, and there staid and talked a good while with him till all the rest come. We went up and saw the Duke dress himself, and in his night habitt he is a very plain man.

1661-04-20 08:20   Here comes my boy to tell me that the Duke of York had sent for all the principal officers, &c., to come to him today.


1661-04-19 22:10   So home, and having staid awhile till Will came in (with whom I was vexed for staying abroad), he comes and then I went by water to my father’s, and then after supper to bed with my wife.

1661-04-19 17:00   It being so foul that I could not go to Whitehall to see the Knights of the Bath made today, which do trouble me mightily.

1661-04-19 14:50   Home, where Sir W. Warren came, and I took him and Mr. Shepley and Moore with me to the Mitre, and there I cleared with Warren for the deals I bought lately for my Lord of him.


1661-04-18 17:40 r Met with two country fellows upon one horse, which I did give the way to, but Sir W. Pen would not, but struck them and they him, and so passed away, but they giving him some high words, he went back again and struck them off their horse, without much honour, in my mind.

1661-04-18 16:10 r It raining hard, we left Sir W. Batten, and we two returned and called at Mr. —— and drank some brave wine there, and then homewards again.

1661-04-18 14:40 r After dinner we all went to the Church stile, and there eat and drank, and I was as merry as I could counterfeit myself to be.

1661-04-18 11:30 r My Lady was in a bad mood, which we were troubled at, and had she been noble she would not have been so with her servants, when we came thither, and this Sir W. Pen took notice of, as well as I.

1661-04-18 11:05   Up with my workmen and then about 9 o’clock took horse with both the Sir Williams for Walthamstow, and there we found my Lady and her daughters all.


1661-04-17 21:10 r Here we had great talk of Mr. Warren’s being knighted by the King, and Sir W. B. seemed to be very much incensed against him.

1661-04-17 20:50   I went to the Dolphin by appointment and there I met Sir Wms. both and Mr. Castle, and did eat a barrel of oysters and two lobsters, which I did give them, and were very merry.

1661-04-17 16:10   Comes Mr. Allen of Chatham, and I took him to the Mitre and there did drink with him, and did get of him the song that pleased me so well there the other day, “Of Shitten come Shites the beginning of love.”

1661-04-17 14:30   So to the office, and that being done I went to dinner with Sir W. Batten, and then home to my workmen, and saw them go on with great content to me.

1661-04-17 09:20   By land and saw the arches, which are now almost done and are very fine, and I saw the picture of the ships and other things this morning, set up before the East Indy House, which are well done.


1661-04-16 11:10 r To Commr. Pett’s lodging, and there had a good breakfast, and in came the two Sir Wms. from Walthamstow, and so we sat down and did a great deal of public business about the fitting of the fleet that is now going out.

1661-04-16 09:00 r Here he and I sat till the Comptroller came and then we put off for Deptford, where we went on board the King’s pleasure boat that Commissioner Pett is making, and indeed it will be a most pretty thing.

1661-04-16 07:40   So soon as word was brought me that Mr. Coventry was come with the barge to the Tower, I went to him, and found him reading of the Psalms in short hand, and had good sport about the long marks that are made there for sentences in divinity, which he is never like to make use of.


1661-04-15 22:30   So home and sent for the Barber, and after that to bed.

1661-04-15 16:50   To my uncle Wight’s, and he and I to Mr. Rawlinson’s, and there staid all the afternoon, it being very foul, and had a little talk with him what good I might make of these ships that go to Portugal by venturing some money by them, and he will give me an answer to it shortly.

1661-04-15 10:30   It being a very foul morning for the King and Lords to go to Windsor, I went to the office and there met Mr. Coventry and Sir Robt. Slingsby, but did no business, but only appoint to go to Deptford together tomorrow.


1661-04-14 21:40   To my father’s, and after supper seemed willing to go home, and my wife seeming to be so too I went away in a discontent, but she, poor wretch, followed me as far in the rain and dark as Fleet Bridge to fetch me back again, and so I did.

1661-04-14 18:20 r Hearing that Mr. Barnwell was come, with some of my Lord’s little children, yesterday to town, to see the Coronacion, I went and found them at the Goat, at Charing Cross, and there I went and drank with them a good while, whom I found in very good health and very merry.

1661-04-14 15:10 r Here my Lord saw us and spoke to me about getting Mr. Moore to come and govern his house while he goes to sea, which I promised him to do and did afterwards speak to Mr. Moore, and he is willing.

1661-04-14 14:40   With Mr. Moore (whom I met there) to my Lord’s, and there he showed me a copy of my Lord Chancellor’s patent for Earl, and I read the preamble, which is very short, modest, and good.

1661-04-14 11:10   I heard Mr. Jacomb, at Ludgate, upon these words, “Christ loved you and therefore let us love one another,” and made a lazy sermon, like a Presbyterian.


1661-04-13 16:30   Home and there by and by took coach with Sir W. Pen and Captain Terne and went to the buriall of Captain Robert Blake, at Wapping, and there had each of us a ring, but it being dirty, we would not go to church with them.

1661-04-13 10:10 r I went to the Banquethouse, and there saw the King heal, the first time that ever I saw him do it; which he did with great gravity, and it seemed to me to be an ugly office and a simple one.

1661-04-13 08:30   To Whitehall by water from Towre-wharf, where we could not pass the ordinary way, because they were mending of the great stone steps against the Coronacion.


1661-04-12 17:30   Since my going out of town, there is one Alexander Rosse taken and sent to the Counter by Sir Thomas Allen, for counterfeiting my hand to a ticket, and we this day at the office have given order to Mr. Smith to prosecute him.

1661-04-12 15:50 r While I am now writing comes one with a tickett to invite me to Captain Robert Blake’s buriall, for whose death I am very sorry, and do much wonder at it, he being a little while since a very likely man to live as any I knew.

1661-04-12 15:20   Back again home and to my chamber, to set down in my diary all my late journey, which I do with great pleasure.

1661-04-12 14:30   Into the City and saw in what forwardness all things are for the Coronacion, which will be very magnificent.

1661-04-12 07:00   Up among my workmen. Comes my wife to see me and my brother John with her, who I am glad to see, but I sent them away because of going to the office.


1661-04-11 22:00 r So to bed very sleepy for last night’s work, concluding that it is the pleasantest journey in all respects that ever I had in my life.

1661-04-11 18:50 r I sent to see how my wife do, who is well, and my brother John come from Cambridge.

1661-04-11 18:00 r So home and I found all well, and a deal of work done since I went.

1661-04-11 17:10 r Mrs. Anne and I rode under the man that hangs upon Shooter’s Hill, and a filthy sight it was to see how his flesh is shrunk to his bones.

1661-04-11 16:00 r Of all the journeys that ever I made this was the merriest, and I was in a strange mood for mirth. Among other things, I got my Lady to let her maid, Mrs. Anne, to ride all the way on horseback; and so I called her my clerk, that she went to wait upon me.

1661-04-11 15:40 r In several places, I asked women whether they would sell me their children, but they denied me all, but said they would give me one to keep for them, if I would.

1661-04-11 12:20 r I met two little schoolboys going with pitchers of ale to their schoolmaster to break up against Easter, and I did drink of some of one of them and give him two pence.

1661-04-11 09:00 r After we had breakfasted, we sett forth for London, and indeed I was a little troubled to part with Mrs. Rebecca, for which God forgive me.

1661-04-11 08:10 r Called up by Sir W. Batten, so I arose and we did some business, and then came Captn. Allen, and he and I withdrew and sang a song or two, and among others took pleasure in “Goe and bee hanged, that’s good-bye.”

1661-04-11 02:05 r Having no mind to leave Mrs. Rebecca, what with talk and singing (her father and I), Mrs. Turner and I staid there till 2 o’clock in the morning and was most exceeding merry, and I had the opportunity of kissing Mrs. Rebecca very often.


1661-04-10 23:40 r So to Captain Allen’s (where we were last night, and heard him play on the harpsicon, and I find him to be a perfect good musician).

1661-04-10 22:55 r Going home, she would needs have me sing, and I did pretty well and was highly esteemed by them.

1661-04-10 22:50 r We continued dancing an hour or two, and so broke up very pleasant and merry, and so walked home, I leading Mrs. Rebecca, who seemed, I know not why, in that and other things, to be desirous of my favours and would in all things show me respects.

1661-04-10 20:30 r After we had done eating, the ladies went to dance, and among the men we had, I was forced to dance too; and did make an ugly shift. Mrs. R. Allen danced very well, and seems the best humoured woman that ever I saw.

1661-04-10 19:40 r We had a fine collacion, but I took little pleasure in that, for the illness of the musique and for the intentness of my mind upon Mrs. Rebecca Allen.

1661-04-10 19:10 r Here we had, for my sake, two fiddles, the one a base viall, on which he that played, played well some lyra lessons, but both together made the worst musique that ever I heard.

1661-04-10 18:30 r I was a little troubled to stay too long, because of going to Hempson’s, which afterwards we did, and found it in all things a most pretty house, and rarely furnished, only it had a most ill access on all sides to it, which is a greatest fault that I think can be in a house.

1661-04-10 18:00 r To the Salutacion tavern, where Mr. Alcock and many of the town came and entertained us with wine and oysters and other things, and hither come Sir John Minnes, who is come today to see “the Henery,” in which he intends to ride as Vice-Admiral in the narrow seas all this summer.

1661-04-10 16:10 r Then away thence, observing the great doors of the church, which, they say, was covered with the skins of the Danes, and also had much mirth at a tomb, on which was “Come sweet Jesu,” and I read “Come sweet Mall,” &c., at which Captain Pett and I had good laughter.

1661-04-10 15:20 r To Rochester, and there saw the Cathedrall, which is now fitting for use, and the organ then a-tuning.

1661-04-10 11:20 r On board the Prince, now in the dock, and indeed it has one and no more rich cabins for carved work, but no gold in her.

1661-04-10 10:30 r To see Commissioner Pett’s house, and here I wondered how my Lady Batten walked up and down with envious looks to see how neat and rich everything is, saying that she would get it, for it belonged formerly to the Surveyor of the Navy.

1661-04-10 09:40 r To see the Dockhouses. First, Mr. Pett’s, and among other things he did offer my Lady Batten a parrot, the best I ever saw, that knew Mingo so soon as it saw him, having been bred formerly in the house with them; but for talking and singing I never heard the like.


1661-04-09 18:50 r Among other pleasures, I put my Lady, Mrs. Turner, Mrs. Hempson, and the two Mrs. Allens into the lanthorn and I went in and kissed them, demanding it as a fee due to a principall officer, with all which we were exceeding merry, and drunk some wine and neat’s tongue, &c.

1661-04-09 18:30 r The sale being done, the ladies and I and Captain Pett and Mr. Castle took barge and down we went to see the Sovereign, which we did, taking great pleasure therein, singing all the way.

1661-04-09 15:25 r Among other things sold there was all the State’s arms, which Sir W. Batten bought; intending to set up some of the images in his garden, and the rest to burn on the Coronacion night.

1661-04-09 15:10 r We went to fit books and things (Tom Hater being this morning come to us) for the sale, by an inch of candle, and very good sport we and the ladies that stood by had, to see the people bid.

1661-04-09 13:40 r Among other strangers that come, there was Mr. Hempson and his wife; Mr. Allen and two daughters of his, both very tall and the youngest very handsome, so much as I could not forbear to love her exceedingly, having, among other things, the best hand that ever I saw.

1661-04-09 11:20 r Sir William and I by coach to the dock and there viewed all the storehouses and the old goods that are this day to be sold, which was great pleasure to me, and so back again by coach home.

1661-04-09 10:05 r In general it was a great pleasure all the time I staid here to see how I am respected and honoured by all people; and I find that I begin to know now how to receive so much reverence, which at the beginning I could not tell how to do.

1661-04-09 09:50 r But sleep overcame all and so lay till high morning, at which time I had a candle brought me and a good fire made.

1661-04-09 03:00 r Waking, and by the light of the moon I saw my pillow (which overnight I flung from me) stand upright, but not bethinking myself what it might be, I was a little afeard.


1661-04-08 22:45 r Sir William telling me that old Edgeborrow, his predecessor, did die and walk in my chamber, did make me some what afeard, but not so much as for mirth’s sake I did seem.

1661-04-08 22:40 r To the Hillhouse at Chatham, where I never was before, and I found a pretty pleasant house and am pleased with the arms that hang up there. Here we supped very merry, and late to bed.

1661-04-08 17:40 r At Rochester, where alight at Mr. Alcock’s and there drank and had good sport, with his bringing out so many sorts of cheese.

1661-04-08 16:00 r From thence a coach took them and me, and Mr. Fowler with some others came from Rochester to meet us, on horseback.

1661-04-08 13:20 r A very pleasant passage and so to Gravesend, where we dined.

1661-04-08 08:00 r We took barge at the Tower, Sir William Batten and his lady, Mrs. Turner, Mr. Fowler and I.

1661-04-08 06:50 r Up early, my Lady Batten knocking at her door that comes into one of my chambers. I did give directions to my people and workmen.


1661-04-07 22:20   I went to Sir W. Batten’s and resolved of a journey tomorrow to Chatham, and so home and to bed.

1661-04-07 13:30 r He did give my Lord and me a good account of the condition of Ireland, and how it come to pass, through the joyning of the Fanatiques and the Presbyterians, that the latter and the former are in their declaration put together under the names of Fanatiques.

1661-04-07 13:10   To White Hall, and there I met with Dr. Fuller of Twickenham, newly come from Ireland; and took him to my Lord’s, where he and I dined.


1661-04-06 17:20 r By water, Creed and I, to Salisbury Court and there saw “Love’s Quarrell” acted the first time, but I do not like the design or words.

1661-04-06 13:40   With Mr. Creed and Moore to the Leg in the Palace to dinner which I gave them, and after dinner I saw the girl of the house, being very pretty, go into a chamber, and I went in after her and kissed her.

1661-04-06 11:20   Met with Mr. Townsend, who told of his mistake the other day, to put both his legs through one of his knees of his breeches, and went so all day.


1661-04-05 22:10   Home, and at night to Sir W. Batten’s, and there very merry with a good barrell of oysters, and this is the present life I lead.

1661-04-05 16:40 r With them to Mr. Lucy’s, a merchant, where much good company, and there drank a great deal of wine, and in discourse fell to talk of the weight of people, which did occasion some wagers, and where, among others, I won half a piece to be spent.

1661-04-05 13:10 r Up among my workmen and so to the office, and then to Sir W. Pen’s with the other Sir William and Sir John Lawson to dinner.


1661-04-04 23:10   So with Mr. Moore to my father’s, where some friends did sup there and we with them and late went home, leaving my wife still there.

1661-04-04 15:00   Went in to my Lord and there we had a great deal of musique, and then came my cozen Tom Pepys and there did accept of the security which we gave him for his 1000l. that we borrow of him, and so the money to be paid next week.


1661-04-03 21:30   Home with my workmen all the afternoon, at night into the garden to play on my flageolette, it being moonshine, where I staid a good while.

1661-04-03 17:10   This day I hear that the Dutch have sent the King a great present of money, which we think will stop the match with Portugal; and judge this to be the reason that our so great haste in sending the two ships to the East Indys is also stayed.

1661-04-03 12:40   Dined with Sir W. Batten and Pen, who would needs have me drink two drafts of sack today to cure me of last night’s disease, which I thought strange but I think find it true.

1661-04-03 00:20 r Parted all friends after drinking a great deal of wine. So home and alone to bed.


1661-04-02 22:30   To the Dolphin to Sir W. Batten, and Pen, and other company; strange how these men, who at other times are all wise, do now, in their drink, betwitt and reproach one another with their former conditions, and their actions as in public concernments, till I was ashamed to see it.

1661-04-02 18:50   To my Father’s, where I found my mother and my wife in a very good mood, and so left them and went home.

1661-04-02 17:30   To White-fryars and saw “The Little Thiefe,” which is a very merry and pretty play, and the little boy do very well.

1661-04-02 14:30   To my Lord’s, where I dined with my Lady, and after we had dined in comes my Lord and Ned Pickering hungry, and there was not a bit of meat left in the house, the servants having eat up all, at which my Lord was very angry, and at last got something dressed.

1661-04-02 10:50   I into St. James’s Park, where I saw the Duke of York playing at Pelemele, the first time that ever I saw the sport.

1661-04-02 09:15 r I found my mother alone weeping upon my last night’s quarrel and so left her, and took my wife to Charing Cross and there left her to see her mother who is not well.

1661-04-02 08:20   Among my workmen early and then along with my wife and Pall to my Father’s by coach there to have them lie a while till my house be done.


1661-04-01 22:40 r So leaving them in the same discontent I went away home, it being a brave moonshine, and to bed.

1661-04-01 22:05   To my father, and there finding a discontent between my father and mother about the maid (which my father likes and my mother dislikes), I staid, persuading my mother to understand herself, and that in some high words, which I was sorry for, but she is grown very froward.

1661-04-01 17:50   To Whitefryars, and there saw part of “Rule a wife and have a wife,” which I never saw before, but do not like it.

1661-04-01 15:20   Went home to dinner with Sir W. Batten, and after that to the Goat tavern by Charing Cross to meet Dr. Castle, where he and I drank a pint of wine and talked about Privy Seal business.

1661-04-01 07:10   Up early among my workmen.
