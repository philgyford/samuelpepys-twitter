1661-09-30 21:45 r The want of money puts all things, and above all things the Navy, out of order; and yet I do not see that the King takes care to bring in any money, but thinks of new designs to lay out money.

1661-09-30 21:37 r We are busy about the business of sending forces to Tangier, and the fleet to my Lord of Sandwich, who is at Lisbon to bring over the Queen. The business of Argier hath of late troubled me, because my Lord hath not done what he went for.

1661-09-30 21:32   So ends this month; myself and family in good condition of health, but my head full of my Lord’s and my own and the office business.

1661-09-30 17:04 r So, having been very much daubed with dirt, I got a coach, and home where I vexed my wife in telling of her this story, and pleading for the Spaniards against the French.

1661-09-30 16:10 r There were several men slain of the French, and one or two of the Spaniards, and one Englishman by a bullet. Which is very observable, the French were at least four to one in number, and had near 100 case of pistols among them, and the Spaniards had not one gun among them.

1661-09-30 15:52 r The truth is, the Spaniards were not only observed to fight most desperately, but also they did outwitt them; first in lining their own harness with chains of iron, then in setting their coach in the most advantageous place, and to appoint men to guard every one of their horses.

1661-09-30 15:46 r To the French house, where I observe, that there is no men in the world of a more insolent spirit where they do well, and more abject if they do miscarry, than these people are; for they all look like dead men, and not a word among them, but shake their heads.

1661-09-30 14:24 r And so I followed the coach, and then met it at York House, where the embassador lies; and there it went in with great state.

1661-09-30 14:05 r But they being come and returned, I ran after them with my boy after me through all the dirt and the streets full of people; till at last, at the Mewes, I saw the Spanish coach go, with fifty drawn swords at least to guard it, and our soldiers shouting for joy.

1661-09-30 13:55 r I, as I am in all things curious, presently got to the water-side, and there took oars to Westminster Palace, thinking to have seen them come in thither with all the coaches.

1661-09-30 13:16 r The Spanish hath got the best of it, and killed three of the French coach-horses and several men, and is gone through the City; at which, it is strange to see how all the City did rejoice. And indeed we do naturally all love the Spanish, and hate the French.

1661-09-30 10:55 r So I went to the Spanish Embassador’s and the French, and there saw great preparations on both sides; but the French made the most noise and vaunted most, the other made no stir almost at all; so that I was afraid the other would have had too great a conquest over them.

1661-09-30 10:03 r To coach back again; and at White Hall light, and saw the soldiers and people running up and down the streets.

1661-09-30 08:47 r To Chelsy, to my Lord Privy Seal, and there got him to seal the business. Here I saw by day-light two very fine pictures in the gallery; and did also go all over the house, and found it to be the prettiest contrived house that ever I saw in my life.

1661-09-30 07:20 r I heard of a fray between the two Embassadors of Spain and France; and that, being the day of the entrance of an Embassador from Sweden, they intended to fight for the precedence! Our King ordered that no Englishman should meddle in the business, but let them do what they would.

1661-09-30 06:10   Up by moon-shine, to White Hall, to meet Mr. Moore at the Privy Seal, but he not being come as appointed, I went into King Street to the Red Lyon to drink my morning draft.



1661-09-29 22:12 r Home and to bed, without prayers, which I never did yet, since I came to the house, of a Sunday night: I being now so out of order that I durst not read prayers, for fear of being perceived by my servants in what case I was.

1661-09-29 20:42 r To Sir W. Pen’s and there supped, where his brother, a traveller, and one that speaks Spanish very well, and a merry man, supped with us, and what at dinner and supper I drink I know not how, of my own accord, so much wine, that I was even almost foxed.

1661-09-29 14:01   To church, and so to dinner, and Sir W. Pen and daughter, and Mrs. Poole, his kinswoman, Captain Poole’s wife, came by appointment to dinner with us, and a good dinner we had for them, and were very merry.


1661-09-28 17:58   Sir W. Pen and his daughter and I and my wife to the Theatre, and there saw “Father’s own Son,” a very good play, and the first time I ever saw it.


1661-09-27 20:32 r Here we staid and supped too, and, after my wife had put up some of the grapes in a basket for to be sent to the King, we took coach and home, where we found a hampire of millons sent to me also.

1661-09-27 17:03 r Comes Mr. Edwd. Montagu (by appointment this morning) to talk with my Lady and me about the provisions fit to be bought, and sent to my Lord along with him. And told us, that we need not trouble ourselves how to buy them, for the King would pay for all.

1661-09-27 16:16   Met my wife at the Wardrobe; and there dined, where we found Captain Country come with some grapes and millons from my Lord at Lisbon, the first that ever I saw any, and my wife and I eat some; but the grapes are rare things.


1661-09-26 18:40 r And so by coach, though hard to get it, being rainy, home.

1661-09-26 17:27   Dined at home, and then abroad with my wife by coach to the Theatre to shew her “King and no King,” it being very well done.


1661-09-25 17:38   Much against my nature and will, yet such is the power of the Devil over me I could not refuse it, to the Theatre, and saw “The Merry Wives of Windsor,” ill done.

1661-09-25 13:35   The Queen of England (as she is now owned and called) I hear doth keep open Court, and distinct at Lisbon.

1661-09-25 12:55   To my Lord Crew’s and dined with him, where I was used with all imaginable kindness both from him and her. And I see that he is afraid that my Lord’s reputacon will a little suffer in common talk by this late success; but there is no help for it now.

1661-09-25 10:55   Meeting Sir R. Slingsby in St. Martin’s Lane, he and I in his coach through the Mewes, which is the way that now all coaches are forced to go, because of a stop at Charing Cross, by reason of a drain there to clear the streets.

1661-09-25 09:40   By coach with Sir W. Pen to Covent Garden. By the way, upon my desire, he told me that I need not fear any reflection upon my Lord for their ill success at Argier, for more could not be done than was done.


1661-09-24 22:03 r I went straight to my Lady, and there sat and talked with her, and so home again, and after supper we to bed somewhat weary, hearing of nothing ill since my absence but my brother Tom, who is pretty well though again.

1661-09-24 17:28 r We got home very timely and well, finding there all well, and letters from sea, that speak of my Lord’s being well, and his action, though not considerable of any side, at Argier.

1661-09-24 14:39 r So we rode easily through, and only drinking at Holloway, at the sign of a woman with cakes in one hand and a pot of ale in the other, which did give good occasion of mirth, resembling her to the maid that served us.

1661-09-24 07:39   We rose, and set forth, but found a most sad alteration in the road by reason of last night’s rains, they being now all dirty and washy, though not deep.

1661-09-24 06:10 r And then it was a very rainy night, and then I was a little weary, that what between waking and then sleeping again, one after another, I never had so much content in all my life, and so my wife says it was with her.

1661-09-24 06:07 r We ad two beds in the room and so lay single, and still remember it that of all the nights that ever I slept in my life I never did pass a night with more epicurism of sleep; there being now and then a noise of people stirring that waked me.


1661-09-23 20:49 r Away to Stevenage, and staid till a showre was over, and so rode easily to Welling, where we supped well.

1661-09-23 13:58   So we took horse and got early to Baldwick; where there was a fair, and we put in and eat a mouthfull of pork, which they made us pay 14d. for, which vexed us much.

1661-09-23 08:05   Up, and sad to hear my father and mother wrangle as they used to do in London, of which I took notice to both, and told them that I should give over care for anything unless they would spend what they have with more love and quiet.


1661-09-22 11:00   Before church time walking with my father in the garden contriving.


1661-09-21 16:05 r I rode to Huntingdon, where I met Mr. Philips, and there put my Bugden matter in order against the Court, and so to Hinchingbroke, where Mr. Barnwell shewed me the condition of the house, which is yet very backward, and I fear will be very dark in the cloyster when it is done.

1661-09-21 12:04   All the morning pleasing myself with my father, going up and down the house and garden with my father and my wife, contriving some alterations.


1661-09-20 14:34 r The father paid a year and a half for his fine, and the son half a year, in all 48l., besides about 3l. fees.

1661-09-20 10:32 r Going towards the Court House, met my uncle Thomas and his son Thomas, with Bradly, the rogue that had betrayed us, and one Young, a cunning fellow, who guides them.

1661-09-20 09:18   Will Stankes and I set out in the morning betimes for Gravely, where to an ale-house and drank.


1661-09-19 22:10 r After dinner set out for Brampton, where we come in very good time, and found all things well, and being somewhat weary, after some talk about tomorrow’s business with my father, we went to bed.

1661-09-19 15:15 r Went back to Cambridge, and there at the Beare we had some herrings, we and my brother.

1661-09-19 11:42 r To our horses, and with my wife went and rode through Sturbridge but the fair was almost done. So we did not ’light there at all.

1661-09-19 09:26   After I had talked and advised with my coz Claxton, and then with my uncle by his bedside, we all horsed away to Cambridge, where my father and I, having left my wife at the Beare with my brother, went to Mr. Sedgewicke, the steward of Gravely.


1661-09-18 21:49 r By and by in comes my father, and we supped and talked and were merry, but being weary and sleepy my wife and I to bed without talking with my father anything about our business.

1661-09-18 18:19 r To the barber’s, and then to my wife again, and remounted for Impington, where my uncle received me and my wife very kindly.

1661-09-18 15:39 r We got to Cambridge, where I left my wife at my cozen Angier’s while I went to Christ’s College, and there found my brother in his chamber, and talked with him.

1661-09-18 12:17 r At last she begun, poor wretch, to be tired, and I to be angry at it, but I was to blame; for she is a very good companion as long as she is well.

1661-09-18 10:28 r Up early and begun our march; the way about Puckridge very bad, and my wife, in the very last dirty place of all, got a fall, but no hurt, though some dirt.


1661-09-17 22:05 r By the mare at one time falling she got a fall, but no harm; so we got to Ware, and there supped, and to bed very merry and pleasant.

1661-09-17 15:33 r And so after all things were ready, she and I took coach to the end of the town towards Kingsland, and there got upon my horse and she upon her pretty mare that I hired for her, and she rides very well.

1661-09-17 08:15 r So I went to my Lady’s and elsewhere to take leave, and of Mr. Townsend did borrow a very fine side-saddle for my wife.

1661-09-17 07:03 r Got up, telling my wife of my journey, and she with a few words got me to hire her a horse to go along with me.


1661-09-16 21:55   I went home, and there found letters from my father informing me of the Court, and that I must come down and meet him at Impington, which I presently resolved to do.

1661-09-16 16:10 r He made a story how he had lost his letter, but he was sure it was for me to go into the country, which I believed, but I afterwards found that it was a rogue that did use to play such tricks to get money of people, but he got none of me.

1661-09-16 15:40   Word was brought me from my brother’s that there is a fellow come from my father out of the country, on purpose to speak to me, so I went to him.

1661-09-16 12:20 r So that from this day I should see how long 10 chaldron of coals will serve my house, if it please the Lord to let me live to see them burned.

1661-09-16 12:15   This morning I was busy at home to take in my part of our freight of Coles, which Sir G. Carteret, Sir R. Slingsby, and myself sent for, which is 10 Chaldron, 8 of which I took in, and with the other to repay Sir W. Pen what I borrowed of him a little while ago.


1661-09-15 16:43 r So we went to church with the corps, and there had service read at the grave, and back again with Pegg Kite who will be, I doubt, a troublesome carrion to us executors; but if she will not be ruled, I shall fling up my executorship.

1661-09-15 15:48 r To the buriall of my aunt Kite, where besides us and my uncle Fenner’s family, there was none of any quality, but poor rascally people.

1661-09-15 10:33   To my aunt Kite’s to help my uncle Fenner to put things in order against anon for the buriall.


1661-09-14 15:13 r So I was forced to leave my uncle and brother Tom at dinner and go forth with them, and we had great pleasure, seeing all four yachts, viz., these two and the two Dutch ones.

1661-09-14 12:40   Before we had dined comes Sir R. Slingsby and his lady, and a great deal of company, to take my wife and I out by barge to shew them the King’s and Duke’s yachts.


1661-09-13 22:15   So to bed, my mind very full of business and trouble.

1661-09-13 20:07 r We went to old George’s, and there eat as much as we would of a hot shoulder of mutton, and so to boat again and home.

1661-09-13 13:40   To the Wardrobe, where I found my wife, and thence she and I to the water to spend the afternoon in pleasure.

1661-09-13 09:43   I was sent for by my uncle Fenner to come and advise about the buriall of my aunt, the butcher, who died yesterday.


1661-09-12 22:00   By link home and called at Sir W. Batten’s, and there hear that Sir W. Pen do take our jest of the tankard very ill, which I am sorry for.

1661-09-12 12:03   To my Lady’s to dinner at the Wardrobe; and in my way upon the Thames, I saw the King’s new pleasure-boat that is come now for the King to take pleasure in above bridge; and also two Gundaloes that are lately brought, which are very rich and fine.


1661-09-11 21:27   My wife was with her brother to see his mistress today, and says she is young, rich, and handsome, but not likely for him to get.

1661-09-11 18:30 r And so after it was done went home with my mind troubled for my going thither, after my swearing to my wife that I would never go to a play without her. What with this and things going so cross to me as to matters of my uncle’s estate, makes me very much troubled in my mind.

1661-09-11 17:55 r So I, against my own mind and resolution, could not forbear to go in, which did make the play seem a burthen to me, and I took no pleasure at all in it.

1661-09-11 15:09   Dr. Williams and I walking through Lincoln’s Fields observed at the Opera a new play, “Twelfth Night” was acted there, and the King there.

1661-09-11 13:03   Home to my house to dinner, where I found my wife’s brother, Balty, as fine as hands could make him, and his servant, a Frenchman, to wait on him, and come to have my wife to visit a young lady which he is a servant to, and have hope to trepan and get for his wife.

1661-09-11 08:09 r And do it with so much care that they shall be quite covered; that if but the tip of the tail hangs out he will take up the cat again, and dig the hole deeper. Which is very strange; and he tells me that he do believe that he hath killed above 100 cats.

1661-09-11 08:07   To Dr. Williams, who did carry me into his garden, where he hath abundance of grapes; and did show me how a dog that he hath do kill all the cats that come thither to kill his pigeons, and do afterwards bury them.


1661-09-10 21:55   I found Mary, my cozen W. Joyce’s maid, come to me to be my cook maid, and so my house is full again.

1661-09-10 21:42   To the Wardrobe to see my Lady, and after supper with the young ladies, bought a link and carried it myself till I met one that would light me home for the link. So he light me home with his own, and then I did give him mine.

1661-09-10 14:32   At the office all the morn, dined at home; then my wife into Wood Street to buy a chest, and thence to buy other things at my uncle Fenner’s (though by reason of rain we had ill walking).


1661-09-09 22:14   I believe when Sir W. Pen do come to understand it he will be angry, he has so talked of the business himself and the letter up and down.

1661-09-09 22:08   We begun to tell Sir W. Pen the business, but he had been drinking to-day, and so is almost gone, that we could not make him understand it.

1661-09-09 19:10   Found Sir Williams both and more company gone to the Dolphin to drink the 30s. that we got the other day of Sir W. Pen about his tankard.

1661-09-09 17:32   It was my fortune to sit by a most pretty and most ingenious lady, which pleased me much.

1661-09-09 17:28   To Salisbury Court play house, where was acted the first time “‘Tis pity Shee’s a Whore,” a simple play and ill acted.

1661-09-09 12:40   I drank so much wine that I was not fit for business, and therefore I went and walked in Westminster Hall a while.

1661-09-09 11:34   To the King’s Privy Kitchen, and Mr. Sayres, the Master Cook, took us into the wine cellar where we were merry, and I drank too much wine.


1661-09-08 21:33   I begun to look over my accounts and upon the whole I do find myself, by what I can yet see, worth near 600l., for which God be blessed, which put me into great comfort.

1661-09-08 18:22 r I pray God give me grace to begin now to look after my business, but it always was, and I fear will ever be, my foible that after I am once got behind-hand with business, I am hard to set to it again to recover it.

1661-09-08 18:10   So up to my chamber all alone, and troubled in mind to think how much of late I have addicted myself to expense and pleasure, that now I can hardly reclaim myself to look after my great business of settling Gravely business, until now almost too late.

1661-09-08 16:24   Coming home found our new maid Doll asleep, that she could not hear to let us in, so that we were fain to send the boy in at a window to open the door to us.


1661-09-07 21:40 r Thence home, it being by reason of our staying a great while for the King’s coming, and the length of the play, near nine o’clock before it was done, and so home, and still in discontent with my wife, to bed.

1661-09-07 20:47 r But I do never a whit like it the better for the puppets, but rather the worse.

1661-09-07 20:45 r And here was “Bartholomew Fayre,” with the puppet-show, acted today, which had not been these forty years (it being so satyricall against Puritanism, they durst not till now, which is strange they should already dare to do it, and the King do countenance it).

1661-09-07 16:45   To the Theatre, where we seated ourselves close by the King, and Duke of York, and Madame Palmer, which was great content; and, indeed, I can never enough admire her beauty.


1661-09-06 22:14   I home, where my wife had been long come home, but I seemed very angry, as indeed I am, and did not show her any countenance, neither before nor in bed, and so slept and rose discontented.

1661-09-06 17:38   I home to dinner all alone, and thence my mind being for my wife’s going abroad much troubled and unfit for business, I went to the Theatre, and saw “Elder Brother” ill acted.

1661-09-06 10:22   My uncle Fenner and I go to see my aunt Kite, whom we found in bed and not like to live as we think, and she told us her mind was that if she should die she should give all she had to her daughter, only 5l. apiece to her second husband’s children.

1661-09-06 09:32   My wife holding her resolution to go this morning as she resolved yesterday, and though there could not be much hurt in it, yet my own jealousy put a hundred things into my mind, which did much trouble me.


1661-09-05 20:33 r My wife and I to the fair, and I showed her the Italians dancing the ropes, and the women that do strange tumbling tricks and so by foot home vexed in my mind about Antony Joyce.

1661-09-05 14:40 r I was taken up by Antony Joyce, which came at last to very high words, which made me very angry, and I did not think that he would ever have been such a fool to meddle with other people’s business, but all the company was offended with him, so we parted angry he and I.

1661-09-05 14:20 r News was brought that my aunt Kite, the butcher’s widow in London, is sick ready to die and sends for my uncle and me to come to take charge of things, and to be entrusted with the care of her daughter.

1661-09-05 12:15 r To my uncle Fenner’s to dinner (meeting a French footman with feathers, who was in quest of my wife, and spoke with her privately, but I could not tell what it was, only my wife promised to go to some place tomorrow, which do trouble my mind how to know whither it was).

1661-09-05 10:14 r To my uncle Fenner’s, and there I found my mother and my wife and Pall, and so I took them, it being late, to Beard’s, where they were staid for, and so I put them into the waggon, and saw them going presently, Pall crying exceedingly.

1661-09-05 08:10   To the Privy Seal about business, in my way taking leave of my mother, who goes to Brampton today.


1661-09-04 17:30   To my mother’s and there staid and drank, and she resolves to be going tomorrow without fail. Many friends come in to take their leave of her, but a great deal of stir I had about getting her to go to see my Lady Sandwich before she goes, which she says she will do tomorrow.

1661-09-04 13:54 r And so to Wilkinson’s, the Cook’s, to dinner, where we sent for Mrs. Sarah and there dined and had oysters, the first I have eat this year, and were pretty good.

1661-09-04 11:04   My wife came to me to Whitehall, and we went and walked a good while in St. James’s Park to see the brave alterations.


1661-09-03 20:20   My wife and I to my mother, who I took a liberty to advise about her getting things ready to go this week into the country to my father, and she (being become now-a-days very simple) took it very ill, and we had a great deal of noise and wrangling about it.

1661-09-03 17:05 r After that was done, we had a very fine banquet, the best I ever was at.

1661-09-03 15:50 r But to my and all our trouble, the Parson of the parish christened her, and did not sign the child with the sign of the cross.

1661-09-03 15:45   With my wife to the Wardrobe, where my Lady’s child was christened (my Lord Crew and his Lady, and my Lady Montagu, my Lord’s mother-in-law, were the witnesses), and named Katherine (the Queen elect’s name).

1661-09-03 11:55   Some of us Commissioners went down to Deptford to pay off some ships, but I could not go, but staid at home all the morning setting papers to rights, and Mr. Howell, our turner, sent me two things to file papers on, very handsome.


1661-09-02 21:49   This night I sent another letter to Sir W. Pen to offer him the return of his tankard upon his leaving of 30s. at a place where it should be brought. The issue of which I am to expect.

1661-09-02 19:52 r She tells that she met at the Change with my young ladies of the Wardrobe, and also with Mr. Somerset, who did give her a bracelet of rings, which did a little trouble me, though I know there is no hurt yet in it, but only for fear of further acquaintance.

1661-09-02 19:44   Home, where my wife has been busy all the day making of pies, and had been abroad and bought things for herself.
