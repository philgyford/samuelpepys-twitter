1661-03-31 22:10   So home and finding Will abroad at Sir W. Batten’s talking with the people there (Sir W. and my Lady being in the country), I took occasion to be angry with him, and so to prayers and to bed.

1661-03-31 16:20   To church again, and after sermon I walked to my father’s, and to Mrs. Turner’s, where I could not woo The. to give me a lesson upon the harpsicon and was angry at it.

1661-03-31 13:40   Home and dined with my wife, she staying at home, being unwilling to dress herself, the house being all dirty.

1661-03-31 11:30   At church, where a stranger preached like a fool.


1661-03-30 16:30 r Into London up and down and drank a pint of wine with Mr. Creed, and so home and sent a letter and the bonds to my uncle to sign for my Lord.

1661-03-30 15:30   So to my coz. Tho. Pepys, and got him to promise me 1,000l. to lend my Lord upon his and my uncle Robert’s and my security. So to my Lord’s, and there got him to sign a bond to him, which I also signed too, and he did sign counter security to us both.

1661-03-30 10:20   At the office we and Sir W. Rider to advise what sort of provisions to get ready for these ships going to the Indies. Then the Comptroller and I by water to Mr. Coventry, and there discoursed upon the same thing.


1661-03-29 21:50   Home and there put some papers in order, and not knowing what to do, the house being so dirty, I went to bed.

1661-03-29 14:40   To Sir W. Batten’s, where great store of company at dinner. Hither came letters from above for the fitting of two other ships for the East Indies in all haste, and so we got orders presently for the Hampshire and Nonsuch.

1661-03-29 10:20   To the office, where I found Sir W. Pen sent down yesterday to Chatham to get two great ships in readiness presently to go to the East Indies upon some design against the Dutch, we think, at Goa but it is a great secret yet.

1661-03-29 08:10   Up among my workmen with great pleasure.


1661-03-28 22:10 r By coach to London, and having set him down in Cheapside I went home, where I found a great deal of work done today, and also 70l. paid me by the Treasurer upon the bill of exchange that I have had hopes of so long, so that, my heart in great content; I went to bed.

1661-03-28 17:50   With Mr. Shepley to the Theatre and saw “Rollo” ill acted.

1661-03-28 09:30   Mr. Creed coming to see me I went along with him to Sir Robert Slingsby (he being newly maister of that title by being made a Baronett) to discourse about Mr. Creed’s accounts to be made up.


1661-03-27 23:30 r Home, where I found my wife all day in her chamber. So to bed.

1661-03-27 22:20 r At last we made Mingo, Sir W. Batten’s black, and Jack, Sir W. Pen’s, dance, and it was strange how the first did dance with a great deal of seeming skill.

1661-03-27 22:00 r In our mirth I sang and sometimes fiddled (there being a noise of fiddlers there), and at last we fell to dancing, the first time that ever I did in my life, which I did wonder to see myself to do.

1661-03-27 14:20   To the Dolphin to a dinner of Mr. Harris’s, where Sir Williams both and my Lady Batten, and her two daughters, and other company, where a great deal of mirth.

1661-03-27 12:10   I found my stairs quite broke down, that I could not get up but by a ladder; and my wife not being well she kept her chamber all this day.

1661-03-27 09:40   My brother Tom comes to me, and among other things I looked over my old clothes and did give him a suit of black stuff clothes and a hat and some shoes.

1661-03-27 07:40   Up early to see my workmen at work.


1661-03-26 17:30 r Mrs. Pierce and her husband and I and my wife to Salisbury Court, where coming late he and she light of Col. Boone that made room for them, and I and my wife sat in the pit, and there met with Mr. Lewes and Tom Whitton, and saw “The Bondman” done to admiration.

1661-03-26 14:10 r Very merry at dinner; among other things, because Mrs. Turner and her company eat no flesh at all this Lent, and I had a great deal of good flesh which made their mouths water.

1661-03-26 12:20   By coach to my father’s, where Mrs. Turner, The, Joyce, Mr. Morrice, Mr. Armiger, Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, and his wife, my father and mother, and myself and my wife.

1661-03-26 11:50   All this morning I staid at home looking after my workmen to my great content about my stairs.

1661-03-26 09:10   This is my great day that three years ago I was cut of the stone, and, blessed be God, I do yet find myself very free from pain again.

1661-03-26 07:30   Up early to do business in my study.


1661-03-25 23:50   I to bed, being pleased well with the work that my workmen have begun today.

1661-03-25 23:05 r Had great discourse with him how he could get sometimes three or four bushells of rags in a day, and got 3d. a bushell for them, and many other discourses, what and how many ways there are for poor children to get their livings honestly.

1661-03-25 22:50   So homewards and took up a boy that had a lanthorn, that was picking up of rags, and got him to light me home.

1661-03-25 21:40   I to Mrs. Turner, and there staid talking late. The. Turner being in a great chafe, about being disappointed of a room to stand in at the Coronacion.

1661-03-25 16:30   To my Lord’s and there I shewed him the King’s picture, which he intends to copy out in little. After that I and Captain Ferrers to Salisbury Court by water, and saw part of the “Queene’s Maske.”

1661-03-25 15:10 r I took him to Whitehall with me by water, but he would not by any means be moved to go through bridge, and so we were fain to go round by the Old Swan.

1661-03-25 14:20   After dinner comes Mr. Salisbury to see me, and showed me a face or two of his paynting, and indeed I perceive that he will be a great master.

1661-03-25 10:30   This morning came workmen to begin the making of me a new pair of stairs up out of my parler, which, with other work that I have to do, I doubt will keep me this two months and so long I shall be all in dirt; but the work do please me very well.


1661-03-24 18:00   Home again, and after a walk in the garden Sir W. Batten’s two daughters came and sat with us a while, and I then up to my chamber to read.

1661-03-24 15:30   With Sir W. Batten and my Lady to dinner, where very merry, and then to church again, where Mr. Mills made a good sermon.


1661-03-23 20:20   At the Mitre met my uncle Wight, and with him Lieut.-Col. Baron, who told us how Crofton, the great Presbyterian minister that had lately preached so highly against Bishops, is clapped up this day into the Tower. Which do please some, and displease others exceedingly.

1661-03-23 16:50 r The play, which is called “All’s lost by Lust,” poorly done; and with so much disorder, among others, that in the musique-room the boy that was to sing a song, not singing it right, his master fell about his ears and beat him so, that it put the whole house in an uprore.

1661-03-23 15:15 r At last into the Pitt, where I think there was not above ten more than myself, and not one hundred in the whole house.

1661-03-23 14:40 r Came back again and went in, where I was led by a seaman that knew me, but is here as a servant, up to the tireing-room, where strange the confusion that there is among them in fitting themselves, especially here, where the clothes are poor, and the actors but common fellows.

1661-03-23 14:00   To the Red Bull (where I had not been since plays come up again), but coming too soon I went out again and walked all up and down the Charterhouse yard and Aldersgate street.


1661-03-22 22:00 r At Deptford we met with Mr. Newborne, and some other friends and their wives in a coach to meet us, and so they went home with us, and at Sir W. Batten’s we supped, and thence to bed, my head akeing mightily through the wine that I drank today.

1661-03-22 19:40 r We set out again in a coach home, and were very merry all the way.

1661-03-22 13:30 r We met with Sir W. Batten, and some company along with him, who had assisted him in his election at Rochester; and so we dined and were very merry.

1661-03-22 11:00 r The day very pleasant, though the way bad.

1661-03-22 08:30 r So my wife got her ready, and about eight o’clock I got a horseback, and my Lady and her two daughters, and Sir W. Pen into coach, and so over London Bridge, and thence to Dartford.

1661-03-22 06:50 r I rose early, and my Lady Batten knocked at her door that comes into one of my chambers, and called me to know whether I and my wife were ready to go.


1661-03-21 23:10   After I was a-bed Sir W. Pen sent to desire me to go with him tomorrow morning to meet Sir W. Batten coming from Rochester.

1661-03-21 20:50   This day I saw the Florence Ambassador go to his audience, the weather very foul, and yet he and his company very gallant.

1661-03-21 15:00 r Here I staid with Mr. Creed all the morning, and at noon dined with my Lord, who was very merry, and after dinner we sang and fiddled a great while.

1661-03-21 11:20   To Whitehall to my Lord, and there did stay with him a good while discoursing upon his accounts.


1661-03-20 18:26 r And indeed the Bishops are so high, that very few do love them.

1661-03-20 17:23 r And chosen with a great deal of zeal, in spite of the other party that thought themselves very strong, calling out in the Hall, “No Bishops! no Lord Bishops!” It do make people to fear it may come to worse, by being an example to the country to do the same.

1661-03-20 17:20   The great talk of the town is the strange election that the City of London made yesterday for Parliament-men; viz. Fowke, Love, Jones, and …, men that are so far from being episcopall that they are thought to be Anabaptists.

1661-03-20 16:30   To White Hall to Mr. Coventry, where I did some business with him, and so with Sir W. Pen (who I found with Mr. Coventry teaching of him upon the map to understand Jamaica).


1661-03-19 22:30 r From thence with him and young Mr. Jones to Penell’s in Fleet Street, and there we drank and talked a good while, and so I home and to bed.

1661-03-19 17:20   Mr. Creed and I to White-Fryars, where we saw “The Bondman” acted most excellently, and though I have seen it often, yet I am every time more and more pleased with Betterton’s action.


1661-03-18 22:20   To bed with my head and mind full of business, which do a little put me out of order, and I do find myself to become more and more thoughtful about getting of money than ever heretofore.

1661-03-18 18:10   I found in the newes-booke that Roger Pepys is chosen at Cambridge for the town, the first place that we hear of to have made their choice yet.

1661-03-18 15:40   Yesterday it was said was to be the day that the Princess Henrietta was to marry the Duke d’Anjou in France.

1661-03-18 10:20   I made inquiry at Greatorex’s and in other places to hear of Mr. Barlow (thinking to hear that he is dead), but I cannot find it so, but the contrary.

1661-03-18 09:00   This morning early Sir W. Batten went to Rochester, where he expects to be chosen Parliament man.


1661-03-17 21:00   To supper at Sir W. Batten’s again, where my wife by chance fell down and hurt her knees exceedingly.

1661-03-17 14:30   My wife and I dined upon a chine of beef at Sir W. Batten’s, so to church again.

1661-03-17 11:20   At church a stranger preached a good honest and painfull sermon.


1661-03-16 22:10 r But by and by he comes and I did let him in, and he did tell me that he was at Guildhall helping to pay off the seamen, and cast the books late.

1661-03-16 20:00   Home, and was very much troubled that Will staid out late, and went to bed early, intending not to let him come in.

1661-03-16 17:30   To Whitehall to my Lord’s, and dined with him, and so to Whitefriars and saw “The Spanish Curate,” in which I had no great content.


1661-03-15 20:50   Sir Williams both and I at a great fish dinner at the Dolphin, given us by two tax merchants, and very merry we were till night, and so home.


1661-03-14 19:30 r With him to the Cock alehouse, where he did ask my advice about his amours, and I did give him it, which was to enquire into the condition of his competitor, who is a son of Mr. Gauden’s, and that I promised to do for him, and he to make what use he can of it to his advantage.

1661-03-14 17:00   Dined with my Lord and Lady, and so with Mr. Creed to the Theatre, and there saw “King and no King,” well acted.

1661-03-14 11:30   With Mr. Creed to an alehouse, where he told me a long story of his amours at Portsmouth to one of Mrs. Boat’s daughters, which was very pleasant.

1661-03-14 10:20   To Mr. Coventry’s, and there had a dispute about my claim to the place of Purveyor of Petty-provisions, and at last to my content did conclude to have my hand to all the bills for these provisions and Mr. Turner to purvey them, because I would not have him to lose the place.


1661-03-13 14:10   At the office all the morning, dined at home, and Mrs. Turner, The, Joyce, and Mr. Armiger, and my father and mother with me, where they stand till I was weary of their company and so away.

1661-03-13 07:20   Early up in the morning to read “The Seaman’s Grammar and Dictionary” I lately have got, which do please me exceeding well.


1661-03-12 22:30   Home, and there had Sir W. Batten and my Lady and all their company and Capt. Browne and his wife to a collation at my house till it was late, and then to bed.

1661-03-12 14:40   To Guildhall, and there set my hand to the book before Colonel King for my sea pay, and blessed be God! they have cast me at midshipman’s pay, which do make my heart very glad.


1661-03-11 20:50   Home and found my wife come home, and among other things she hath got her teeth new done by La Roche, and are indeed now pretty handsome, and I was much pleased with it.

1661-03-11 17:20   I went to the theatre, and there saw “Love’s Mistress” done by them, which I do not like in some things as well as their acting in Salsbury Court.


1661-03-10 15:40   To church, and there heard one Castle, whom I knew of my year at Cambridge. He made a dull sermon.

1661-03-10 13:00   Dined at home on a poor Lenten dinner of coleworts and bacon.


1661-03-09 13:40 r He took me aside, and asked me what the world spoke of the King’s marriage. Which I answering as one that knew nothing, he enquired no further of me. But I do perceive by it that there is something in it that is ready to come out that the world knows not of yet.

1661-03-09 12:20   To my Lord’s, where we found him lately come from Hinchingbroke, where he left my uncle very well, but my aunt not likely to live.

1661-03-09 11:22 r He giving me an occasion I told him of my intention to get 60l. paid me by him for a gratuity for my labour extraordinary at sea. Which he did not seem unwilling to, and therefore I am very glad it is out.

1661-03-09 11:10   To Whitehall and there with Mr. Creed took a most pleasant walk for two hours in the park, which is now a very fair place. We had a long and candid discourse one to another of one another’s condition.


1661-03-08 23:55 r Also to hear the discourse of so many high Cavaliers of things past. It was a great content and joy to me.

1661-03-08 23:50 r I was much contented to ride in such state into the Tower, and be received among such high company, while Mr. Mount, my Lady Duchess’s gentleman usher, stood waiting at table, whom I ever thought a man so much above me in all respects.

1661-03-08 23:45 r And so he carried Sir William Batten and I home again in his coach, and so I almost overcome with drink went to bed.

1661-03-08 23:05 r At last came in Sir William Wale, almost fuddled; and because I was set between him and another, only to keep them from talking and spoiling the company, he fell out with the Lieutenant of the Tower; but with much ado we made him under stand his error, and then all quiet.

1661-03-08 22:45 r After dinner, to drink all the afternoon. Towards night the Duchess and ladies went away. Then we set to it again till it was very late.

1661-03-08 13:10   Sir W. Batten, Col. Slingsby and I by coach to the Tower, to Sir John Robinson’s, to dinner. Where great good cheer. High company; among others the Duchess of Albemarle, who is ever a plain homely dowdy.

1661-03-08 01:55 r I wrote a letter to him to send tomorrow morning for him to take my money for me, and so with good words I thought to coy with him. To bed.

1661-03-08 01:20   Met with ill news that my hopes of getting some money for the Charles were spoiled through Mr. Waith’s perverseness, which did so vex me that I could not sleep.


1661-03-07 22:40   Towards home and met Spicer, D. Vines, Ruddiard, and a company more of my old acquaintance, and went into a place to drink some ale, and there we staid playing the fool till late, and so I home.

1661-03-07 15:20   To Mr. Crew to Mr. Moore, and he and I to London to Guildhall to see the seamen paid off, but could not without trouble, and so I took him to the Fleece tavern, where the pretty woman that Luellin lately told me the story of dwells, but I could not see her.

1661-03-07 08:30   Sir Williams both went to Woolwich to sell some old provisions there.


1661-03-06 22:00 r But my Lady being come home out of the country ill by reason of much rain that has fallen lately, and the waters being very high, we could not, and so I home and to bed.

1661-03-06 19:10   To Whitehall with Captn. Cuttle, and there I did some business with Mr. Coventry, and after that home, thinking to have had Sir W. Batten, &c., to have eat a wigg at my house at night.

1661-03-06 13:50   At dinner Sir W. Batten came and took me and my wife to his house to dinner, my Lady being in the country, where we had a good Lenten dinner.


1661-03-05 22:30 r So home, and I with my head full of thoughts how to get a little present money, I eat a bit of bread and cheese, and so to bed.

1661-03-05 18:20   I then to the office, where Sir Williams both and I set about making an estimate of all the officers’ salaries in ordinary in the Navy.

1661-03-05 16:30   To the Commissioners of Parliament, and there did take some course about having my Lord’s salary paid tomorrow when the Charles is paid off, but I was troubled to see how high they carry themselves, when in good truth nobody cares for them.

1661-03-05 14:00   I to my Lady’s and there dined, and had very much talk and pleasant discourse with my Lady, my esteem growing every day higher and higher in her and my Lord.

1661-03-05 12:10   With Mr. Pierce, purser, to Westminster Hall, and there met with Captain Cuttance, Lieut. Lambert, and Pierce, surgeon, thinking to have met with the Commissioners of Parliament, but they not sitting, we went to the Swan, where I did give them a barrel of oysters.


1661-03-04 16:10   To dinner and so to Whitehall to Mr. Coventry about several businesses, and then with Mr. Moore, who went with me to drink a cup of ale, and after some good discourse then home and sat late talking with Sir W. Batten.

1661-03-04 11:50   To the office all the forenoon.

1661-03-04 08:10 r And a brave George, all of diamonds, and this with the greatest expressions of love and confidence that I could imagine or hope for, which is a very great joy to me.

1661-03-04 08:05 r Before his going he did give me some jewells to keep for him, viz., that that the King of Sweden did give him, with the King’s own picture in it, most excellently done.

1661-03-04 07:50   My Lord went this morning on his journey to Hinchingbroke, Mr. Parker with him; the chief business being to look over and determine how, and in what manner, his great work of building shall be done.


1661-03-03 21:10   In the Abby all the afternoon. Then at Mr. Pierces the surgeon, where Shepley and I supped. So to my Lord’s, who comes in late and tells us how news is come today of Mazarin’s being dead, which is very great news and of great consequence.

1661-03-03 14:40   Home, where being told that my Lord had sent for me I went, and got there to dine with my Lord, who is to go into the country tomorrow.

1661-03-03 11:30   Mr. Woodcocke preached at our church a very good sermon upon the imaginacions of the thoughts of man’s heart being only evil.


1661-03-02 18:12 r But above all it was strange to see so little a boy as that was to act Cupid, which is one of the greatest parts in it.

1661-03-02 18:00 r It seems it was a new play, “The Queen’s Maske,” wherein there are some good humours: among others, a good jeer to the old story of the Siege of Troy, making it to be a common country tale.

1661-03-02 14:20   I went to the Theatre, where I found so few people (which is strange, and the reason I did not know) that I went out again, and so to Salsbury Court, where the house as full as could be.


1661-03-01 23:10   Sat up late, spending my thoughts how to get money to bear me out in my great expense at the Coronacion, against which all provide, and scaffolds setting up in every street. I had many designs in my head to get some, but know not which will take. To bed.

1661-03-01 18:40   To my father’s and found my mother ill.

1661-03-01 17:20 r He and I walked into London, he to the Wardrobe and I to Whitefryars, and saw “The Bondman” acted; an excellent play and well done. But above all that ever I saw, Betterton do the Bond man the best.

1661-03-01 14:30   Mr. Shepley and I in private talking about my Lord’s intentions to go speedily into the country, but to what end we know not. We fear he is to go to sea with this fleet now preparing. But we wish that he could get his 4000l. per annum settled before he do go.
