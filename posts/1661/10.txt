1661-10-31 21:17   At the alehouse I found my uncle Fenner drinking and very jolly and youthsome, and as one that I believe will in a little time get a wife.

1661-10-30 19:49   I do see the inconvenience that do attend the increase of a man’s fortune by being forced to keep more servants, which brings trouble.

1661-10-30 19:34   I find my wife displeased with her maid Doll, whose fault is that she cannot keep her peace, but will always be talking in an angry manner.

1661-10-30 17:45   There shall be no funerall, which I am sorry for, that there should be nothing done for the honour of Sir Robert.

1661-10-30 17:42   At Sir R. Slingsby’s, pretending that the corps stinks, they will bury it to-night privately, and so will unbespeak all their guests.

1661-10-30 14:53   I got Capt. Lambert to shew me every hole and corner of his ship, the Norwich, much to my information, and the purpose of my going.

1661-10-29 21:27   This Lord Mayor brings up the Custom of Lord Mayors going the day of their installment to Paul’s, and walking round about the Cross.

1661-10-29 20:43   We met at the Dolphin, and should have been merry, but their wine was so naught, and all other things out of order, that we were not so.

1661-10-29 13:04   The Sir Williams were both loth to go, because of the crowd, and so none of us went, and I staid and dined with them.

1661-10-29 12:52   I put on my half cloth black stockings and my new coat of the fashion, and with my beaver I was ready to go to my Lord Mayor’s feast.

1661-10-28 20:53   To the Ringo alehouse, and sent for a belt-maker, and bought of him a handsome belt for second mourning, which cost me 24s and is very neat.

1661-10-28 17:52   A woman acted Parthenia and came on the stage in men’s clothes, and had the best legs that ever I saw, and I was very well pleased with it.

1661-10-28 15:21   I sent for Captain Ferrers to me, who comes with a friend of his, and they and I to the Theatre, and there saw “Argalus and Parthenia.”

1661-10-28 13:38   To Hunt’s and found my Theorbo done which pleases me well and costs 26s to the altering. He tells me it is as good a lute as any in England.

1661-10-27 19:10   Among other things going up into my uncle and aunt Wight’s chamber to see their pictures, which I am forced to commend against my judgment.

1661-10-27 19:04   To see my uncle and aunt Wight, and there staid and talked and supped with them, and were merry as we could be in their company.

1661-10-27 15:32   To church again, my wife with me, whose mourning is now grown so old that I am ashamed to go to church with her.

1661-10-27 11:04   Both Sir Williams and I had talk about the death of Sir Robert, which troubles me much; and them in appearance, though I do not believe it.

1661-10-26 19:32   Sir R. Slingsby, a man that loved me, and had many qualitys that made me to love him above all the officers and commissioners in the Navy.

1661-10-26 19:25   News was brought that Sir R. Slingsby (who hath this day been sick a week) is dead; which put me into so great a trouble of mind.

1661-10-26 17:07   “The Country Captain” is so silly a play as in all my life I never saw, and the first that ever I was weary of in my life.

1661-10-26 17:00   Sir W. Pen, my wife and I to the Theatre, and there saw “The Country Captain,” the first time it hath been acted this twenty-five years.

1661-10-25 22:17   This day I did give my man Will a sound lesson about his forbearing to give us the respect due to a master and mistress.

1661-10-25 18:49   I called at Hunt’s, and there saw my lute, which is now almost done, it being to have a new neck to it and to be made to double strings.

1661-10-25 17:47   Whether my wife be jealous or no I know not, but she loves not that I should speak of Mrs. Pierce.

1661-10-25 17:46   We met Mrs. Pierce and her comrade Mrs. Clifford, and I seeming willing to stay with them to talk my wife grew angry.

1661-10-25 17:27   My wife and I to the Opera, and there saw “Love and Honour,” a play so good that it has been acted but three times and I have seen them all.

1661-10-25 14:09   To dinner at the Wardrobe, where my wife met me, and there we met with a venison pasty, and my Lady very merry and very handsome, methought.

1661-10-24 18:08   I went to see Sir Robert, who continues ill, and this day has not spoke at all, which makes them all afeard of him.

1661-10-23 17:30   Back to the Opera, and there I saw again “Love and Honour,” and a very good play it is.

1661-10-22 22:04   So home after visiting my aunt Wight and Mrs. Norbury (who continues still a very pleasant lady), and to supper.

1661-10-22 20:42   In the afternoon about business up and down and at night to visit Sir R. Slingsby who is fallen sick of this new disease, an ague and fever.

1661-10-21 17:48   The play, “Love and Honour,” being the first time of their acting it, is a very good plot, and well done.

1661-10-21 15:32   The Opera is now newly begun to act again, after some alteracion of their scene, which do make it very much worse.

1661-10-21 15:22   Against my judgment and conscience (which God forgive, for my very heart knows that I offend God in breaking my vows herein) to the Opera.

1661-10-21 08:08   Mr. Pargiter is the man of the world that I do most know and believe to be a cheating rogue.

1661-10-21 08:06   We drank our morning draft of cake and ale, and did make good sport of Mr. Pargiter, the goldsmith, losing so much by the King’s coming in.

1661-10-20 16:49   To Sir W. Batten who is to go to Portsmouth to-morrow to wait upon the Duke of York, who goes to set in order the garrison there.

1661-10-20 12:14   Much offended in mind at a proud trick my man Will hath got, to keep his hat on in the house, but I will not speak of it to him to-day.

1661-10-19 14:32   We had a very good and handsome dinner. I not being neat in clothes, which I find a great fault in me, could not be so merry as otherwise.

1661-10-19 13:22   Here they have a design to get the King to hire a dock for the herring busses, which is now the great design on foot, to lie up in.

1661-10-19 13:05   To Captain Marshe’s at Limehouse, a house that hath been their ancestors for 250 years, by the lime-house which gives the name to the place.

1661-10-19 06:30   I first put on my waistcoat to lie in all night this year, and do not intend to put it off again till spring.

1661-10-18 22:24   The tumor is abated by a poultice of a handful of bran with half a pint of vinegar and a pint of water boiled till it be thick.

1661-10-18 22:20   This night lying alone having this last 7 or 8 days been troubled with a tumor in one of my stones.

1661-10-18 19:05   I met with complaints at home that my wife left no victuals for them all this day.

1661-10-18 09:49   To Mr. Pierce to advise about the things to be sent to my Lord for the Queen’s provision. Now there is all haste made for the fleet’s going.

1661-10-17 13:49   The King of Portugall is a very rude and simple fellow and, for reviling of somebody a little while ago, was run into the cods with a sword.

1661-10-17 13:35   Dined with Captain Lambert, and had much talk of Portugall; from whence he is lately come, and he tells me it is a very poor dirty place.

1661-10-17 10:28   Captain Cock was confident that the Parliament would bring trouble with it, and enquire how the King had disposed of offices and money.

1661-10-16 14:12   Dined with me, Dr Thos. Pepys, my Coz Snow, and my brother Tom, upon a fin of ling and some sounds, neither of which did I ever know before.

1661-10-16 13:00   Came several maids to be hired. My wife pitched upon one Nell who would not be hired under half a year, which I am pleased at her drollness.

1661-10-16 12:06   In bed till 12 o’clock.

1661-10-15 16:37   Home in much pain. By walking too much yesterday I have made my testicle to swell again, which much troubles me.

1661-10-14 20:07   Lord! what a sad story Mr. Pim makes of his being abused by a Dr. of Physique who is in one part of the tenement wherein he dwells.

1661-10-14 18:48   Mr. Pim went with us to the Fountain and did give us store of wine. It being the Duke of York’s birthday we drank the more to his health.

1661-10-14 13:45   To the Wardrobe, and dined with my Lady, the first time I have seen her dine abroad since her being brought to bed of my Lady Katherine.

1661-10-13 20:14   Did not stir out all day, but dined below. Left off half skirts and put on a wastecoate, and my false taby wastecoate with gold lace.

1661-10-12 16:25   In bed the greatest part of this day also, and my swelling in some measure gone.

1661-10-12 12:02   Sir R. Bernard do fear that my uncle has not observed the custom of Brampton in his will, which puts me to a great trouble in mind.

1661-10-11 23:03   To bed again in more ease than last night.

1661-10-11 18:12   All day in bed with a cataplasm to my Codd.

1661-10-10 22:08   Yet my wife and I pretty merry.

1661-10-10 22:05   Intended to be merry, it being my sixth wedding night; but by a bruise in one of my testicles I am in so much pain that I in pain to bed.

1661-10-10 17:48   Sir W. Pen, my wife and I to the Theatre, where the King came and there was “The Traytor” most admirably acted; a most excellent play it is.

1661-10-09 12:04   I found Mrs Pierce, la belle, and Madam Clifford, and made them welcome; I was (God knows) very well pleased with their beautiful company.

1661-10-09 10:43   Went out about my affairs, among others to put my Theorbo out to be mended.

1661-10-08 18:10   Took Mrs. Martha to the Theatre in a frolique, to my great expense, and shewed her part of the “Beggar’s Bush,” without much pleasure.

1661-10-08 16:04   Went and eat some Colchester oysters with Sir W. Batten at his house, and there dined and staid there talking all the afternoon.

1661-10-07 20:22   Troubled in my mind till I can hear from Brampton, how things go on at Sturtlow, at the Court.

1661-10-06 11:47   Mrs. Margaret Pen this day come to church in a new flowered satin suit that my wife helped to buy her the other day.

1661-10-06 11:38   The three sisters, the Thornburys, a fine, and the most zealous people that ever I saw in my life, even to admiration, if it were true zeal.

1661-10-06 11:28   To church; Mr. Mills preached, who, I expect, should take in snuffe that my wife not come to his child’s christening the other day.

1661-10-05 21:30   Sir W. Pen and I alone to the Dolphin, and there eat some bloat-herrings and drank good sack.

1661-10-05 17:22   Staid at home all the afternoon putting up my Lord’s model of the Royal James, which I borrowed of him long ago to hang up in my room.

1661-10-04 20:42   Home, where I found my wife vexed at her people for grumbling to eat Suffolk cheese, which I also am vexed at.

1661-10-04 17:04   Captain Ferrers and I to the Theatre, and came too late, so we saw a bit of “Victoria,” which pleased me worse than it did the other day.

1661-10-03 21:06   My Lady Batten had yesterday been at the play where we were, and it was good sport to hear how she talked of it with admiration like a fool.

1661-10-02 17:49   Sitting in an ill place I never had so little pleasure in a play in my life, yet it was the first time that I saw it, “Victoria Corombona.”

1661-10-02 11:54   The slut is like to prove so troublesome that I am out of heart with troubling myself in her business.

1661-10-02 11:52   All this morning at Pegg Kite’s with my uncle Fenner, and two friends of his, appraising her goods that her mother has left.

1661-10-01 20:44   To my study to set matters and papers in order, which, though I can hardly bring myself to do, yet do please me much when it is done.

1661-10-01 08:32   Word was brought me that my singing master, Mr. Goodgroome, was come to teach me and so my wife rose and this morning began to learn also.

1661-10-01 08:09   My wife and I fell into talk of musique, and desired that I would let her learn to sing, which I did consider, and promised her she should.
