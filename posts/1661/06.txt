1661-06-30 22:08 r Myself in good health, but mighty apt to take cold, so that this hot weather I am fain to wear a cloth before my belly.

1661-06-30 22:04 r Myself lately under a great expense of money upon myself in clothes and other things, but I hope to make it up this summer by my having to do in getting things ready to send with the next fleet to the Queen.

1661-06-30 11:03   To church, where we observe the trade of briefs is come now up to so constant a course every Sunday, that we resolve to give no more to them.


1661-06-29 21:57 r Mr. Chetwind by chewing of tobacco is become very fat and sallow, whereas he was consumptive, and in our discourse he fell commending of “Hooker’s Ecclesiastical Polity,” as the best book, and the only one that made him a Christian, which puts me upon the buying of it.

1661-06-29 21:21   I walked to the Bell at the Maypole in the Strand, and thither came to me by appointment Mr. Chetwind, Gregory, and Hartlibb, so many of our old club, and Mr. Kipps, where we staid and drank and talked with much pleasure till it was late.

1661-06-28 12:13   At home all the morning practising to sing, which is now my great trade.


1661-06-27 17:25   With my Lady Batten, Mrs. Rebecca Allen, Mrs. Thompson, &c., two coaches of us, we went and saw “Bartholomew Fayre” acted very well.


1661-06-26 16:04   Went to my father, and found by a letter to him from my aunt that my uncle Robert is taken with a dizziness in his head, so that they desire my father to come down to look after his business, by which we guess that he is very ill, and so my father do think to go tomorrow.


1661-06-25 22:24   Came Captain Allen and his daughter Rebecca and Mr. Hempson, and by and by both Sir Williams, who sat with me till it was late, and I had a very gallant collation for them.

1661-06-25 10:19   Came Mr. Goodgroome to me (recommended by Mr. Mage), with whom I agreed presently to give him 20s. entrance, which I then did, and 20s. a month more to teach me to sing, and so we began, and I hope I have come to something in it.

1661-06-21 14:07   Home with my uncle Wight to dinner, where among others (my aunt being out of town), Mr. Norbury and I did discourse of his wife’s house and land at Brampton, which I find too much for me to buy.

1661-06-21 09:14   Going to my father’s I met him, and so he and I went and drank our morning draft at the Samson in Paul’s Churchyard, and eat some gammon of bacon, &c., and then parted, having bought some green Say for curtains in my parler.

1661-06-19 22:09   One thing I must observe here while I think of it, that I am now become the most negligent man in the world as to matters of news, insomuch that, now-a-days, I neither can tell any, nor ask any of others.

1661-06-19 20:22   Thanks be to God I am very well again of my late pain, and tomorrow hope to be out of my pain of dirt and trouble in my house, of which I am now become very weary.

1661-06-19 11:48   All the morning almost at home, seeing my stairs finished by the painters, which pleases me well.


1661-06-18 21:44   I met Jack Cole, who staid with me a good while, and is still of the old good humour that we were of at school together, and I am very glad to see him.

1661-06-18 20:04 r Home again, there being a little pretty witty child that is kept in their house that would not let us go without her, and so fell a-crying by the water-side.

1661-06-18 16:47   My wife and I by water to Captain Lambert’s, where we took great pleasure in their turret-garden, and seeing the fine needle-works of his wife, the best I ever saw in my life, and afterwards had a very handsome treat and good musique that she made upon the harpsicon.

1661-06-18 12:07   All this morning at home vexing about the delay of my painters.


1661-06-17 15:13   Home to my painters, who are now about painting my stairs.


1661-06-16 16:52   The afternoon I spent in reading “The Spanish Gypsey,” a play not very good, though commended much.


1661-06-15 13:53   I went and dined with my Lady, who, now my Lord is gone, is come to her poor housekeeping again.


1661-06-14 16:42 r Went home by coach to bed, and went not to the office at all, and by keeping myself warm, I broke wind and so came to some ease.

1661-06-14 15:14   To my father’s, and did give him order about the buying of this cloth to send to my Lord. But I could not stay with him myself, for having got a great cold by my playing the fool in the water yesterday I was in great pain.


1661-06-13 22:14 r Young Poole took us on board the Charity and gave us wine there, with which I had full enough, and so to our wherry again, and there fell asleep till I came almost to the Tower, and there the Captain and I parted, and I home and with wine enough in my head, went to bed.

1661-06-13 19:21 r At Woolwich went on shore, in the company of Captain Poole of Jamaica and young Mr. Kennersley, and many others, and so to the tavern where we drank a great deal both wine and beer.

1661-06-13 18:02 r We toward London in our boat. Pulled off our stockings and bathed our legs a great while in the river, which I had not done some years before.

1661-06-13 17:13 r So with a sad and merry heart I left them sailing pleasantly from Erith, hoping to be in the Downs tomorrow early.

1661-06-13 16:52 r Captain Ferrers with me into our wherry, and my Lord did give five guns, all they had charged, which was the greatest respect my Lord could do me, and of which I was not a little proud.

1661-06-13 16:24 r We set sayle, and anon went to dinner, my Lord and we very merry; and after dinner I went down below and there sang, and took leave of W. Howe, Captain Rolt, and the rest of my friends, then went up and took leave of my Lord, who give me his hand and parted with great respect.

1661-06-13 11:42 r I went down with my Lord in the barge to Deptford, and there went on board the Dutch yacht and staid there a good while, W. Howe not being come with my Lord’s things, which made my Lord very angry.

1661-06-13 07:12   I went up and down to Alderman Backwell’s, but his servants not being up, I went home and put on my gray cloth suit and faced white coat, made of one of my wife’s pettycoates, the first time I have had it on.


1661-06-12 19:13   To White Hall, where I met my Lord, who told me he must have 300l. laid out in cloth, to give in Barbary, as presents among the Turks. At which occasion of getting something I was very glad.

1661-06-12 17:22   At home all day with my workmen, and doing several things, among others writing the letter resolved of yesterday to the Duke.

1661-06-12 09:41   With Captain Rolt and Ferrers we went to Lambeth to drink our morning draft, where at the Three Mariners, a place noted for their ale, we went and staid awhile very merry, and so away.

1661-06-12 07:10   A day kept between a fast and a feast, the Bishops not being ready enough to keep the fast for foul weather before fair weather came; and so they were forced to keep it between both.


1661-06-11 11:28 r How men are not able to serve us more without some money; and that now the credit of the office is brought so low, that none will sell us any thing without our personal security given for the same.

1661-06-11 11:23   At the office, Sir G. Carteret with us; and we agreed upon a letter to the Duke of York, to tell him the sad condition of this office for want of money.


1661-06-10 22:14   To bed, where we lay in Sir R. Slingsby’s lodgings in the dining room there in one green bed, my house being now in its last work of painting and whiting.

1661-06-10 13:43   I dined with my Lady; but after we were set, comes in some persons of condition, and so the children and I rose and dined by ourselves, all the children and I, and were very merry and they mighty fond of me.

1661-06-10 08:41 r He tells me that he do intrust me with the seeing of all things done in his absence as to this great preparation, as I shall receive orders from my Lord Chancellor and Mr. Edward Montagu. At all which my heart is above measure glad; for my Lord’s honour and some profit to myself.

1661-06-10 08:20   To my Lord’s, who privately told me how the King had made him Embassador in the bringing over the Queen. That he is to go to Algier, &c., to settle the business, and to put the fleet in order there; and so to come back to Lisbone with three ships.


1661-06-09 14:11 r She and I walked to my Lady’s at the Wardrobe, and there dined and was exceeding much made of.

1661-06-09 10:41   My wife put on her black silk gown, which is now laced all over with black gimp lace, as the fashion is, in which she is very pretty.


1661-06-08 21:15   Called upon Mr. Rawlinson, for his advice to answer a letter of my uncle Robert, wherein he do offer me a purchase to lay some money upon, that joynes upon some of his own lands. I am advised to give up wholly the disposal of my money to him, let him do what he will with it.

1661-06-08 20:10 r Meeting Mr. Creed at the door, he and I went to the tobacco shop under Temple Bar gate, and there went up to the top of the house and there sat drinking Lambeth ale a good while.

1661-06-08 17:35   I went to the Theatre and there saw Bartholomew Faire, the first time it was acted now a-days. It is a most admirable play and well acted, but too much prophane and abusive.

1661-06-08 10:13   My Lord did tell me that he would have me go to Mr. Townsend, whom he had ordered to discover to me the whole mystery of the Wardrobe, and none else but me, and that he will make me deputy with him for fear that he should die in my Lord’s absence, of which I was glad.


1661-06-07 22:32   After dinner to the office, and there till late at night.


1661-06-06 18:58 r Here came two young gentlewomen to see Mr. Holland, and one of them could play pretty well upon the viallin, but, good God! how these ignorant people did cry her up for it! We were very merry.

1661-06-06 17:38 r The Captain and I again to Bridewell to Mr. Holland’s, where his wife also, a plain dowdy, and his mother was. Here I paid Mrs. Holland the money due from me to her husband.

1661-06-06 14:10 r There we went and eat and drank and heard musique at the Globe, and saw the simple motion that is there of a woman with a rod in her hand keeping time to the musique while it plays, which is simple, methinks.

1661-06-06 12:07 r My head hath aked all night, and all this morning, with my last night’s debauch.

1661-06-06 10:55   Called up this morning by Lieutenant Lambert, who is now made Captain of the Norwich, and he and I went down by water to Greenwich, in our way observing and discoursing upon the things of a ship, he telling me all I asked him, which was of good use to me.

1661-06-06 00:15 r And there we staid talking and singing, and drinking great drafts of claret, and eating botargo and bread and butter till 12 at night, it being moonshine; and so to bed, very near fuddled.


1661-06-05 20:23   So home Sir William and I, and it being very hot weather I took my flageolette and played upon the leads in the garden, where Sir W. Pen came out in his shirt into his leads.

1661-06-05 16:19   Sir W. Pen and I went home with Sir R. Slingsby to bowls in his ally, and there had good sport, and afterwards went in and drank and talked.

1661-06-05 09:49   I did give my wife 4l. to lay out upon lace and other things for herself.


1661-06-04 19:50 r From thence to the Theatre and saw “Harry the 4th,” a good play. That done I went over the water and walked over the fields to Southwark, and so home and to my lute.

1661-06-04 14:32   To my Lord Crew’s to dinner with him, and had very good discourse about having of young noblemen and gentlemen to think of going to sea, as being as honourable service as the land war.

1661-06-04 10:30 r But the houses did not like us, and so that design at present is stopped.

1661-06-04 10:11   The Comptroller came to get me to go see a house or two near our office, which he would take for himself or Mr. Turner, and then he would have me have Mr. Turner’s lodgings and himself mine and Mr. Davis’s.


1661-06-03 18:31   Mr. Creed and I to the Towre, to speak for some ammunition for ships for my Lord; and so he and I, with much pleasure, walked quite round the Towre, which I never did before.

1661-06-03 17:30 r Before we had done in comes my father Bowyer and my mother and four daughters, and a young gentleman and his sister, their friends, and there staid all the afternoon, which cost me great store of wine, and were very merry.

1661-06-03 13:40 r So I saw my Lord into the barge going to Whitehall, and I and Mr. Creed home to my house, whither my father and my cozen Scott came to dine with me, and so we dined together very well.

1661-06-03 10:05 r I had a good occasion to tell him that, since it has pleased God to bless me with something, I am desirous to lay out something for my father, and so have pitched upon Mr. Young’s place in the Wardrobe. Which my Lord did freely promise me, at which I was very glad.

1661-06-03 09:44   To the Wardrobe, where discoursing with my Lord, he did instruct me as to the business of the Wardrobe, in case, in his absence, Mr. Townsend should die, and told me that he do intend to joyne me and Mr. Moore with him as to the business, now he is going to sea.


1661-06-02 16:24 r It rained very hard, as it hath done of late so much that we begin to doubt a famine, and so he was forced to stay longer than I desired.

1661-06-02 15:05 r Discoursing of many things in mathematics, and among others he showed me how it comes to pass the strength that levers have, and he showed me that what is got as to matter of strength is lost by them as to matter of time.

1661-06-02 13:30   To church again, and going home I found Greatorex (whom I expected today at dinner) come to see me, and so he and I in my chamber drinking of wine and eating of anchovies.

1661-06-02 09:30   The barber having done with me, I went to church, and there heard a good sermon of Mr. Mills, fit for the day.


1661-06-01 22:10   Having wrote letters into the country and read some things I went to bed.

1661-06-01 16:46 r From Deptford we walked to Redriffe, calling at the half-way house, and there come into a room where there was infinite of new cakes placed that are made against Whitsuntide, and there we were very merry.

1661-06-01 13:34   Sir W. Pen and I and Mr. Gauden by water to Woolwich, and there went from ship to ship to give order for and take notice of their forwardness to go forth, and then to Deptford and did the like, having dined at Woolwich with Captain Poole at the tavern there.
