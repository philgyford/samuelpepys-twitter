1661-08-31 21:46   The season very sickly every where of strange and fatal fevers.

1661-08-31 21:44   At Court things are in very ill condition, there being so much emulacion, poverty, and the vices of drinking, swearing, and loose amours.

1661-08-31 21:41   I have trouble about my brother Tom, who is left to keep my father’s trade. I have fears that he will miscarry for want of brains and care.

1661-08-31 21:38   I find myself too much given to seeing of plays, and expense, and pleasure, which makes me forget my business, which I must labour to amend.

1661-08-31 15:52   Into Christ’s Hospitall, and there I did give every one of them a bauble, which was the little globes of glass with things hanging in them.

1661-08-31 15:10   I met with my Ladies Jemimah and Paulina at seeing the monkeys dance, which was much to see. It troubled me to sit among such nasty company.

1661-08-31 13:59   A dirty slut or two come up that were whores. I took no pleasure but a great deal of trouble in getting from thence for fear of being seen.

1661-08-31 13:21   Luellin and I to the tavern and after that to Bartholomew fair, and there upon his motion to a pitiful alehouse.

1661-08-30 17:33   My wife met a son of Lord Somersett whom she knew in France, a pretty man; I showed him no great countenance, to avoyd further acquaintance.

1661-08-30 17:04   To the French comedy, which was so ill done, every thing so nasty and out of order, that I was sick all the while in my mind to be there.

1661-08-29 17:32   Mr. Evans told us that the estate God hath blessed him with is too great to give where there is nothing in possession but a trade and house.

1661-08-29 16:46   I with my father to an alehouse, and there came Mr. Evans, the taylor, whose daughter we have had a mind to get for a wife for Tom.

1661-08-28 18:05   This day I counterfeited a letter to Sir W. Pen, as from the thief that stole his tankard lately, only to abuse and laugh at him.

1661-08-27 21:32   My wife would have me to do something for her brother Balty but I am afeard to meddle for fear I shall not be able to wipe my hands of him.

1661-08-27 17:21   To the Theatre and saw “The Joviall Crew,” where the King, Duke, Duchess, and Madame Palmer were; my wife had a sight of them all the while.

1661-08-27 13:54   My wife and I to Thos. Pepys where some ladies and my father and mother, where merry but methinks he makes but poor dinners for such guests.

1661-08-26 22:31   A letter from my Lord Sandwich, who is now well of his feaver, but not yet gone from Alicante, where he lay sick, and was twice let blood.

1661-08-26 21:55   I took leave of Mr Fanshaw who goes to-morrow to Portugal. We drank a great deal of wine, I too much and Mr Fanshaw till he could hardly go.

1661-08-26 17:15   To the Theatre, and saw the “Antipodes,” wherein there is much mirth, but no great matter else.

1661-08-26 07:53   I shall never have one to please us better in all things. I gave Jane 2s. 6d. over and bade her adieu, my mind full of trouble at her going.

1661-08-26 07:49   I made even with my maid Jane, who has this day been my maid three years, and is this day to go into the country to her mother.

1661-08-25 18:38   I got my father to yield that Pall should go into the country with my mother and him, and stay there to see how she will demean herself.

1661-08-25 18:30   In great anger told Pall before my father that I would keep her no longer, and my father he said he would have nothing to do with her.

1661-08-25 16:10   I found my Lady Batten and her daughter to look something askew upon my wife, because my wife do not buckle to them.

1661-08-25 15:04   To church with my wife, and had a very good and pungent sermon of Mr. Mills, discoursing the necessity of restitution.

1661-08-24 21:55   Met with Mr Spong and took him to the Sampson in Paul’s churchyard, and staid till late, and it rained hard so we were fain to get home wet.

1661-08-24 17:21   To the Opera and saw “Hamlet, Prince of Denmark,” done with scenes very well. Above all, Betterton did the prince’s part beyond imagination.

1661-08-24 12:43   The Comptroller and I to Sir Rd. Ford’s and viewed the house again and are come to a complete end with him to give him 200l. per an. for it.

1661-08-24 11:26   I do believe that the baboon already understands much English, and I am of the mind it might be taught to speak or make signs.

1661-08-24 11:20   It is a great baboon, but so much like a man in most things, I cannot believe but that it is a monster got of a man and she-baboon.

1661-08-24 11:04   We are called to Sir W. Batten’s to see the strange creature that Captain Holmes hath brought with him from Guiny.

1661-08-23 17:49   I took my wife to the Opera, and shewed her “The Witts,” which I had seen already twice, and was most highly pleased with it.

1661-08-23 11:29   T. Trice took my father and me to one of the judges, and there we were sworn, and so back again to the alehouse and drank and parted.

1661-08-23 10:38   To Tom Trice’s to an alehouse near, and there sat and talked, and finding him fair we examined my uncle’s will before him and Dr. Williams.

1661-08-23 09:27   I found my father and my mother in a discontent, which troubles me much, and indeed she is become very simple and unquiet.

1661-08-22 19:08   With my aunt Wight, my wife, and Pall and I to her house by coach, and there staid and supped upon a Westphalia ham.

1661-08-22 13:12   My uncle Fenner’s house so hot, that my uncle Wight, my father and I were fain to go out, and stay at an alehouse awhile to cool ourselves.

1661-08-22 12:43   Took my wife by coach to my uncle Fenner’s, where there was great deal of company, but poor entertainment, which I wonder at.

1661-08-21 15:48   The girl is very well favoured, and a very child, but modest, and one I think will do very well for my brother.

1661-08-21 15:35   Mrs. Whately only is afeard that her daughter is too young and portion not big enough, but offers 200l. down with her.

1661-08-21 15:32   To Mrs. Whately’s again, and there were well received, and she desirous to have the thing go forward.

1661-08-21 14:14   I understand by Mr. Moore that my Lady Sandwich is brought to bed yesterday of a young Lady, and is very well.

1661-08-21 10:32   With Mrs. Terry we discoursed about and agreed to go to her mother this afternoon to speak with her.

1661-08-21 10:06   To Mrs. Terry, a daughter of Mr. Whately’s, who lately offered a proposal of her sister for a wife for my brother Tom.

1661-08-20 17:04   At the office in the morning and all the afternoon at home to put my papers in order.

1661-08-20 11:41   We come to some agreement with Sir R. Ford for his house to be added to the office to enlarge our quarters.

1661-08-19 21:30   This day my aunt Fenner dyed.

1661-08-19 19:52   My Lady do keep the children at home, and lets them not come any more hither at present, which a little troubles me to lose their company.

1661-08-19 19:39   So homewards, but when we came to look for our coach we found it gone, so we were fain to walk home afoot and saved our money.

1661-08-19 17:55   I hired a coach and went to Chelsy, and there at an alehouse sat and drank and past the time till my Lord Privy Seal came to his house.

1661-08-19 14:58   In comes the King in a plain common riding-suit and velvet cap, in which he seemed a very ordinary man to one that had not known him.

1661-08-19 14:30   I found a thing of my Lord Chancellor’s to be sealed, and so I am forced to go to Worcester House, where severall Lords are met in Council.

1661-08-19 12:04   The children are sent for by their mother my Lady Sandwich to dinner, and my wife goes along with them by coach.

1661-08-18 21:37   Fell to read in “Hooker’s Ecclesiastical Polity,” which Mr. Moore did give me; which I shall read with great pains and love for his sake.

1661-08-18 18:48   To walk in St. James’s Park, and saw great variety of fowl which I never saw before and so home.

1661-08-18 15:05   I took my wife and Mr. Sidney to my Lady to see my Lord Hinchingbroke, who is now well again, and sits up and walks about his chamber.

1661-08-17 19:29   Troubled in mind that I cannot bring myself to mind my business, but to be so much in love of plays.

1661-08-17 16:54   Captain Ferrers and I to the Opera, and saw “The Witts”, which I like exceedingly. The Queen of Bohemia was here, brought by my Lord Craven.

1661-08-17 11:05   I walked with Ned Pickering into St. James’s Park (where I had not been a great while), and there found great and very noble alterations.

1661-08-16 22:52   I understand my Aunt Fenner is upon the point of death.

1661-08-16 11:46   Among others, the famous Tom Fuller is dead of it; and Dr. Nichols, Dean of Paul’s; and my Lord General Monk is very dangerously ill.

1661-08-16 11:44   It is such a sickly time both in City and country (of a sort of fever), that never was heard of almost, unless it was in a plague-time.

1661-08-16 10:32   All our clerks are gone to the buriall of Tom Whitton, a very ingenious, and a likely young man to live, as any in the Office.

1661-08-15 21:55   I followed Sir W. Pen to the Dolphin, and there we sat awhile, and so home after we had made shift to fuddle Mr. Falconer of Woolwich.

1661-08-15 17:01   “The Witts” is a most excellent play, and admirable scenes.

1661-08-15 14:50   To the Opera, which begins again to-day with “The Witts,” never acted yet with scenes; and the King and Duke and Duchess were there.

1661-08-15 13:00   I told my Lady of my Lord’s sickness (of which though it hath been the town-talk, she had heard nothing) and recovery of which she was glad.

1661-08-14 21:10   A letter from Mr Creed that tells me that my Lord is rid of his pain (which was wind got into the muscles of his right side) and his feaver.

1661-08-14 13:45   I went to my Lady’s and dined with her, and found my Lord Hinchingbroke somewhat better.

1661-08-14 10:30   Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen and I waited upon the Duke of York, to give him an account of the condition of the Navy for lack of money.

1661-08-13 21:22   I home, and there found my Lady’s three sons come, of which I am glad that I am in condition to do her and my Lord any service in this kind.

1661-08-13 15:15   We had like to have come to some high words between my mother and me, who is become a very simple woman.

1661-08-13 15:09   Pall being there I spoke to my father about my intention not to keep her longer for such and such reasons, which troubled him and me also.

1661-08-13 14:49   I went to my father’s, where I found him within, and went up to him, and there found him settling his papers against his removal.

1661-08-13 13:27   My Lady intends to send her other three sons, Sidney, Oliver, and John, to my house, for fear of the small-pox.

1661-08-13 13:04   To the Wardrobe to dinner, where I met my wife, and found my young Lord very ill.

1661-08-12 18:25   My heart full of trouble for my Lord Sandwich’s sickness, whom we are now confirmed is sick ashore at Alicante.

1661-08-12 16:40   I went to my Lord Hinchingbroke and there found him very ill, and in great fear of the smallpox.

1661-08-12 15:21   I had notice that my Lord Hinchingbroke is fallen ill, which I fear is with the fruit that I did give them at my house.

1661-08-11 18:33   I met with Ned Pickering, who told me what a great match of hunting of a stagg the King had yesterday.

1661-08-11 15:05   To Clerkenwell Church, only to see the two fayre Botelers. I had my full view of them both, but I am out of conceit now with them.

1661-08-10 17:36   To the Theatre, and saw “The merry Devill of Edmunton,” which is a very merry play, the first time I ever saw it, which pleased me well.

1661-08-10 10:52   My father and I did agree with my uncle Wight to meet with my uncle Thomas and read over the Captain’s will for their satisfaction.

1661-08-10 09:42   Came the maid that my wife hath hired for a chamber maid. She is very ugly, so that I cannot care for her, but otherwise seems very good.

1661-08-09 22:20   So to bed.

1661-08-09 21:39   I hear by my wife that Mrs. Hater is not yet delivered, but continues in her pains.

1661-08-09 20:45   I took coach to my father’s, where I found him come home this day from Brampton (as I expected) very well.

1661-08-09 18:19   Mons. Eschar and I took some wine and went to la belle Pierce, who we find big with child, and a pretty lady, one Mrs. Clifford, with her.

1661-08-09 17:03   My Lord Privy Seal caused Mr. Moore to read over the bills, and all ended well. So that I see the Lyon is not so fierce as he is painted.

1661-08-09 16:16   I to White Hall, where comes my Lord Privy Seal, and so we went up to his chamber over the gate at White Hall.

1661-08-09 13:47   News is brought by Mr. Hater that his wife is now falling into labour, so he is come for my wife, who presently went with him.

1661-08-09 09:58   I did promise to be a friend to the son-in-law’s family if he should die, which was all he desired of me, but I do believe he will recover.

1661-08-09 09:21   Word is brought me by a son-in-law of Mr. Pierces that his father is a dying and that he desires that I would come to him before he dies.

1661-08-08 21:38   Discoursing of musique Mons. Eschar spoke so much against the English and in praise of the French that made Mr Mage mad and so he went away.

1661-08-08 20:05   I took Mons. Eschar and Mr. Moore and Dr. Pierce’s brother (the souldier) to the tavern next the Savoy, and there staid and drank with them.

1661-08-08 17:10   To the Privy Seal; but my Lord comes not, which made me mad and gives all the world reason to talk of his delaying of business.

1661-08-07 21:04   To-morrow is a Seal day at the Privy Seal, and it being my month, I am to wait upon my Lord Roberts, Lord Privy Seal, at the Seal.

1661-08-07 17:52   With much ado got to London, where I found all well at home and at my father’s and my Lady’s, but no news yet from my Lord where he is.

1661-08-07 09:30   At Hatfield we walked into the great house; and I would fain have stolen a pretty dog that followed me, but I could not, which troubled me.

1661-08-07 04:02   Called up at three o’clock, and was a-horseback by four.

1661-08-06 21:04   I went to see the church, but I find that both here, and every where else, the Quakers do still continue, and rather grow than lessen.

1661-08-06 20:30   The landlady being a pretty woman, but I durst not take notice of her, her husband being there.

1661-08-06 20:25   Took horse for London, and with much ado, the ways being very bad, got to Baldwick, and there lay and had a good supper by myself.

1661-08-06 13:40   Tom Trice and I to Brampton, where I home to my father who could discern that I had been drinking, which he did never see or hear of before.

1661-08-06 12:03   Took horse and rode to Huntingdon, where I staid with Thos. Trice and Mr. Philips drinking.

1661-08-05 22:53   Back again to Brampton and after supper to bed, being now very quiet in the house, which is a content to us.

1661-08-05 18:53   To Graveley, and there at an alehouse met with Chandler and Jackson with whom I had a great deal of discourse, much to my satisfaction.

1661-08-05 14:24   Rode to Yelling, to my cozen Nightingale’s, who hath a pretty house here, and did learn of her all she could tell me concerning my business.

1661-08-05 11:42   To Brampton, and there found my father well, and my aunt gone from the house, which I am glad of, though it costs us a great deal of money.

1661-08-05 08:06   At Stanton borrowed a coat of a man for 6d, and so he rode all the way, poor man, without any.

1661-08-05 08:04   Early to Huntingdon, but was fain to stay a great while at Stanton because of the rain.

1661-08-04 19:32   The young men in Parliament are the most prophane swearing fellows that ever Roger Pepys heard in his life.

1661-08-04 19:27   Roger Pepys told me how basely things have been carried in Parliament by the young men, that did oppose all things moved by serious men.

1661-08-04 11:38   To church, and had a good sermon, and my uncle Talbot went with us and at our coming in the country-people all rose with so much reverence.

1661-08-04 08:42   Discoursed about my uncle’s will. Roger Pepys tells me I shall meet with a great deal of trouble in it. However, he told me what to do.

1661-08-04 07:50   Got up, and by and by walked into the orchard with my cozen Roger, and there plucked some fruit.

1661-08-03 22:57   I rode with Roger Pepys and his two brothers to Impington, and there with great respect was led up by them to the best chamber in the house.

1661-08-03 21:25   They tell me how high the old doctors are in the University over those they found there; for which I am very sorry.

1661-08-03 21:15   I went to the Rose, and there with Mr. Pechell, Sanchy, and others, sat and drank till night and were very merry.

1661-08-03 12:40   I went to the Castle Hill, where the judges were at the Assizes; and I staid till Roger Pepys rose and went with him.

1661-08-03 12:02   I met with a letter-carrier of Cambridge, with whom I rode all the way to Cambridge, my horse being tired, and myself very wet with rain.

1661-08-03 09:10   I got up early and got to Barkway, where I staid and drank.

1661-08-02 20:04   I rode to Ware, having much discourse with a fellmonger, a Quaker, who told me what a wicked man he had been till within this two years.

1661-08-02 14:57   After dinner my brother Tom came to me and then I made myself ready to get a-horseback for Cambridge.

1661-08-01 14:42   I hear how nurse’s husband has spoken of my Lady Batten how she was such a man’s whore and indeed I do believe that the story is true.

1661-08-01 13:53   We had a venison pasty, brought hot from London, and were very merry.

1661-08-01 10:32   Sir Williams both, and my wife and I and Mrs. Margarett Pen went by coach to Walthamstow, a-gossiping to Mrs. Browne.
