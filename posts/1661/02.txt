1661-02-28 21:25 r And what the meaning of this fleet is which we are now sheathing to set out for the southward. Most think against Algier against the Turk, or to the East Indys against the Dutch who, we hear, are setting out a great fleet thither.

1661-02-28 21:20   This month ends with two great secrets under dispute but yet known to very few: first, Who the King will marry.

1661-02-28 16:00 r We went to Captain Bodilaw’s, and there made sale of many old stores by the candle, and good sport it was to see how from a small matter bid at first they would come to double and treble the price of things.

1661-02-28 13:20 r Capt. Cuttance and I walked from Redriffe to Deptford, where I found both Sir Williams and Sir G. Carteret at Mr. Uthwayt’s, and there we dined. Notwithstanding my resolution, yet for want of other victualls, I did eat flesh this Lent, but am resolved to eat as little as I can.

1661-02-28 09:00   I took boat at Whitehall for Redriffe, but in my way overtook Captain Cuttance and Teddiman in a boat and so ashore with them at Queenhithe, and so to a tavern with them to a barrel of oysters, and so away.


1661-02-27 16:50   This day the Commissioners of Parliament begin to pay off the Fleet, beginning with the Hampshire, and do it at Guildhall, for fear of going out of town into the power of the seamen, who are highly incensed against them.

1661-02-27 14:00   My father dined with me and did show me a letter from my brother John, wherein he tells us that he is chosen Schollar of the house, which do please me much, because I do perceive now it must chiefly come from his merit.

1661-02-27 13:20   I called for a dish of fish, which we had for dinner, this being the first day of Lent; and I do intend to try whether I can keep it or no.

1661-02-27 11:40   I walked in the garden with little Captain Murford, where he and I had some discourse concerning the Light-House again, and I think I shall appear in the business, he promising me that if I can bring it about, it will be worth 100l. per annum.


1661-02-26 22:20   To Sir W. Batten to the Dolphin, where Mr. Newborne, &c., were, and there after a quart or two of wine, we home, and I to bed where (God forgive me) I did please myself by strength of fancy with the young country Segnora that was at dinner with us today.

1661-02-26 20:20   To my house, where I found my Valentine with my wife, and here they drank, and then went away. Then I sat and talked with my Valentine and my wife a good while, and then saw her home.

1661-02-26 13:40 r Back to Mrs. Turner’s, where several friends, all strangers to me but Mr. Armiger, dined. Very merry and the best fritters that ever I eat in my life. After that looked out at window; saw the flinging at cocks.

1661-02-26 09:10   I to Mrs. Turner’s, who I found busy with The. and Joyce making of things ready for fritters, so to Mr. Crew’s and there delivered Cotgrave’s Dictionary to my Lady Jemimah.


1661-02-25 18:20   By water to the office, and there Sir W. Pen and I met and did business all the afternoon, and then I got him to my house and eat a lobster together.

1661-02-25 10:50   To W. Symons where we found him abroad, but she, like a good lady, within, and there we did eat some nettle porrige, which was made on purpose to-day for some of their coming, and was very good.


1661-02-24 11:20   My Valentine had her fine gloves on at church today that I did give her.

1661-02-24 11:00   Mr. Mills made as excellent a sermon against drunkenness as ever I heard in my life.


1661-02-23 22:00   This is now 28 years that I am born. And blessed be God, in a state of full content, and great hopes to be a happy man in all respects, both to myself and friends.

1661-02-23 17:20   To Whitefriars to the Play-house, and there saw “The Changeling,” the first time it hath been acted these twenty years, and it takes exceedingly. I see the gallants do begin to be tyred with the vanity and pride of the theatre actors who are indeed grown very proud and rich.

1661-02-23 14:10   Mr. Townsend, who tells me that the old man is yet alive in whose place in the Wardrobe he hopes to get my father, which I do resolve to put for.

1661-02-23 11:30   To my Lord and there spoke to him about his opinion of the Light, the sea-mark that Captain Murford is about, and do offer me an eighth part to concern myself with it, and my Lord do give me some encouragement in it, and I shall go on.

1661-02-23 09:55 r It is confessed that they were not fully married till about a month or two before she was brought to bed; but that they were contracted long before, and time enough for the child to be legitimate.

1661-02-23 09:50 r He told me how my Lord Chancellor had lately got the Duke of York and Duchess, and her woman, my Lord Ossory’s and a Doctor, to make oath before most of the judges of the kingdom, concerning all the circumstances of their marriage.

1661-02-23 09:40   Mr. Hartlibb did give me a glass of Rhenish wine at the Steeleyard, and so to Whitehall by water. He continues of the same bold impertinent humour that he was always of and will ever be.

1661-02-23 07:50   This my birthday, 28 years.


1661-02-22 21:40   My wife to Sir W. Batten’s, and there sat a while; he having yesterday sent my wife half-a-dozen pairs of gloves, and a pair of silk stockings and garters, for her Valentine’s gift.

1661-02-22 18:30 r Mrs. The. and Joyce took us all into the coach home, calling in Bishopsgate Street, thinking to have seen a new Harpsicon that she had a making there, but it was not done, and so we did not see it.

1661-02-22 17:10 r Here I staid all the afternoon talking of the King’s being married, which is now the town talk, but I believe false.

1661-02-22 14:40   After dinner came The. Turner, and so I home with her to her mother, good woman, whom I had not seen through my great neglect this half year, but she would not be angry with me.


1661-02-21 10:40   So to the Hall and called for some caps that I have a making there, and here met with Mr. Hawley, and with him to Will’s and drank.

1661-02-21 08:20   To Westminster by coach with Sir W. Pen, and in our way saw the city begin to build scaffolds against the Coronacion.


1661-02-20 22:10   All of us to Sir W. Pen’s, where we had, and my Lady Batten, Mrs. Martha, and my wife, and other company, a good supper.

1661-02-20 13:50   All the morning at the office, dined at home and my brother Tom with me, who brought me a pair of fine slippers which he gave me.


1661-02-19 22:10   It raining hard and bitter cold (the first winter day we have yet had this winter), I took coach home and spent the evening in reading of a Latin play, the “Naufragium Joculare.” And so to bed.

1661-02-19 14:00   To my Lord’s and found him dined, and so I lost my dinner, but I staid and played with him and Mr. Child, &c., some things of four parts.

1661-02-19 12:30   The Comptroller tells me, he is sure that the King is not yet married, as it is said; nor that it is known who he will have.

1661-02-19 10:45 r But he says Blondeau will shortly come over, and then we shall have it better, and the best in the world.

1661-02-19 10:40 r We staid walking in the gallery; where we met with Mr. Slingsby, that was formerly a great friend of Mons. Blondeau, who showed me the stamps of the King’s new coyne; which is strange to see, how good they are in the stamp and bad in the money, for lack of skill to make them.

1661-02-19 10:10 r Who afterwards, with the Duke of York, my Lord Sandwich, and others, went into a private room to consult: and we were a little troubled that we were not called in with the rest. But I do believe it was upon something very private.

1661-02-19 09:55   By coach to Whitehall with Colonel Slingsby (carrying Mrs. Turner with us) and there he and I up into the house, where we met with Sir G. Carteret.


1661-02-18 23:10   It is much talked that the King is already married to the niece of the Prince de Ligne, and that he hath two sons already by her: which I am sorry to hear; but yet am gladder that it should be so, than that the Duke of York and his family should come to the crown.

1661-02-18 23:00   I got the whole company and Sir Wm. Pen home to my house, and there I did give them Rhenish wine and sugar, and continued together till it was late.

1661-02-18 15:20   My wife and I and Mrs. Martha Batten, my Valentine, to the Exchange, and there upon a payre of embroydered and six payre of plain white gloves I laid out 40s. upon her. Then we went to a mercer’s at the end of Lombard Street and there she bought a suit of Lutestring for herself.

1661-02-18 13:50   At the office all the morning, dined at home with a very good dinner, only my wife and I, which is not yet very usual.


1661-02-17 11:10   A most tedious, unreasonable, and impertinent sermon, by an Irish Doctor. His text was “Scatter them, O Lord, that delight in war.” Sir Wm. Batten and I very much angry with the parson.


1661-02-16 17:10   I dined with my Lord and then to the Theatre, where I saw “The Virgin Martyr,” a good but too sober a play for the company.

1661-02-16 11:50   I did also get him to sign a bill (which do make my heart merry) for 60l. to me, in consideration of my work extraordinary at sea this last voyage, which I hope to get paid.


1661-02-15 16:30   I found myself to be clear (as I think) 350l. in the world, besides my goods in my house and all things paid for.

1661-02-15 16:10   At the office all the morning, and in the afternoon at making up my accounts for my Lord tomorrow.


1661-02-14 22:15 r And also the great preparation for the King’s crowning is now much thought upon and talked of.

1661-02-14 22:00   The talk of the town now is, who the King is like to have for his Queen: and whether Lent shall be kept with the strictness of the King’s proclamation; which it is thought cannot be, because of the poor, who cannot buy fish.

1661-02-14 14:15 r The first time I ever carried my wife a-ship-board, as also my boy Wayneman, who hath all this day been called young Pepys, as Sir W. Pen’s boy young Pen.

1661-02-14 13:50 r All into the barge again, and so to Woolwich, on board the Rose-bush, Captain Brown’s ship, that is brother-in-law to Sir W. Batten, where we had a very fine dinner, dressed on shore, and great mirth and all things successfull.

1661-02-14 11:00 r We, with a great deal of company, went down by our barge to Deptford, and there only went to see how forward Mr. Pett’s yacht is.

1661-02-14 09:05 r So up I went and took Mrs. Martha for my Valentine (which I do only for complacency), and Sir W. Batten he go in the same manner to my wife, and so we were very merry.

1661-02-14 07:50   To Sir W. Batten’s, but would not go in till I asked whether they that opened the door was a man or a woman, and Mingo, who was there, answered a woman, which, with his tone, made me laugh.


1661-02-13 22:20   Here we sat late, and so home to bed, having got my Lady Batten to give me a spoonful of honey for my cold.

1661-02-13 18:20   My uncle Wight drank with us, and with him to Sir W. Batten’s, whither I sent for my wife, and we chose Valentines against tomorrow. My wife chose me, which did much please me; my Lady Batten Sir W. Pen, &c.

1661-02-13 13:40   Dined at home, and poor Mr. Wood with me, who after dinner would have borrowed money of me, but I would lend none.


1661-02-12 19:50 r Then Creed and I (the other being lost in the crowd) to drink a cup of ale at Temple Bar, and there we parted, and I (seeing my father and mother by the way) went home.

1661-02-12 17:00 r By coach to the Theatre, and there saw “The Scornfull Lady,” now done by a woman, which makes the play appear much better than ever it did to me.

1661-02-12 14:50 r The two others and I after a great dispute whither to go, we went by water to Salsbury Court play-house, where not liking to sit, we went out again.

1661-02-12 13:50   I and Mr. Pickering, Creed, and Captain Ferrers to the Leg in the Palace to dinner, where strange Pickering’s impertinences.


1661-02-11 16:50   With young Mr. Reeve home to his house, who did there show me many pretty pleasures in perspectives,1 that I have not seen before, and I did buy a little glass of him cost me 5s.

1661-02-11 14:40   To the Exchange, and took Mr. Warren with me to Mr. Kennard, the master joiner, at Whitehall, who was at a tavern, and there he and I to him, and agreed about getting some of my Lord’s deals on board tomorrow.


1661-02-10 20:20   My wife and I did please ourselves talking of our going into France, which I hope to effect this summer.

1661-02-10 17:30   Took physique all day, and, God forgive me, did spend it in reading of some little French romances.

1661-02-10 12:00   One came to ask for Mrs. Hunt that was here yesterday, and it seems is not come home yet, which makes us afraid of her.


1661-02-09 17:20   Creed and I to Whitefriars’ to the Play-house, and saw “The Mad Lover,” the first time I ever saw it acted, which I like pretty well.


1661-02-08 16:25 r How the poorest men do use their slaves best. How some rogues do live well, if they do invent to bring their masters in so much a week by their industry or theft; and then they are put to no other work at all. And theft there is counted no great crime at all.

1661-02-08 16:15 r At their redemption they pay so much for the water they drink at the public fountaynes, during their being slaves. How they are beat upon the soles of their feet and bellies at the liberty of their padron.

1661-02-08 16:00 r There we spent till four o’clock, telling stories of Algiers, and the manner of the life of slaves there. And truly Captn. Mootham and Mr. Dawes (who have been both slaves there) did make me acquainted with their condition there: as, how they eat nothing but bread and water.

1661-02-08 12:30   To the Exchange to meet Mr. Warren the timber merchant, but could not meet with him. Here I met with many sea commanders, and among others Captain Cuttle, and Curtis, and Mootham, and I, went to the Fleece Tavern to drink.


1661-02-07 16:20 r I dined with my Lord, and then with Mr. Shepley and Creed (who talked very high of France for a fine country) to the tavern, and then I home.

1661-02-07 11:20 r Among others, Mr. Creed and Captain Ferrers tell me the stories of my Lord Duke of Buckingham’s and my Lord’s falling out at Havre de Grace, at cards; they two and my Lord St. Alban’s playing.

1661-02-07 11:10 r He had dined at Havre de Grace on Monday last, and came to the Downs the next day, and lay at Canterbury that night; and so to Dartford, and thence this morning to White Hall. All my friends his servants well.

1661-02-07 10:50   After a walk to my Lord’s; where, while I and my Lady were in her chamber in talk, in comes my Lord from sea, to our great wonder.


1661-02-06 13:30   I had a dish of fish and a good hare, which was sent me the other day by Goodenough the plasterer.

1661-02-06 09:20   Called up by my Cozen Snow, who sat by me while I was trimmed, and then I drank with him, he desiring a courtesy for a friend, which I have done for him.


1661-02-05 17:10   I went by coach to the play-house at the Theatre, our coach in King Street breaking, and so took another. Here we saw Argalus and Parthenia, which I lately saw, but though pleasant for the dancing and singing, I do not find good for any wit or design therein.

1661-02-05 12:00   Into the Hall and there saw my Lord Treasurer go up to the Treasury Offices, and take possession thereof; and also saw the heads of Cromwell, Bradshaw, and Ireton, set up upon the further end of the Hall.

1661-02-05 10:20   I went to Will’s, and there found Shaw and Ashwell and another Bragrave (who knew my mother wash-maid to my Lady Veere), who by cursing and swearing made me weary of his company and so I went away.


1661-02-04 21:40   We sat late, talking with my Lady and others and Dr. Whistler, who I found good company and a very ingenious man.

1661-02-04 18:20   Home, and then with my wife to see Sir W. Batten, who could not be with us this day being ill, but we found him at cards.

1661-02-04 14:40 r Here I took pleasure to take the forfeits of the ladies who would not do their duty by kissing of them; among others a pretty lady, who I found afterwards to be wife to Sir W. Batten’s son.

1661-02-04 14:25 r The Comptroller begun some sports, among others the naming of people round and afterwards demanding questions of them that they are forced to answer their names to, which do make very good sport.

1661-02-04 14:10   I to the Dolphin where Sir William Pen and the Comptroller and several others were, men and women; and we had a very great and merry dinner.

1661-02-04 09:15   A hot debate about the business of paying off the Fleet, and how far we should join with the Commissioners of Parliament, which is now the great business of this month more to determine, and about which there is a great deal of difference between us.


1661-02-03 16:40   I am told how Sir Thomas Crew’s Pedro, with two of his countrymen, did last night kill one soldier of four that quarrelled with them in the street, about 10 o’clock. The other two are taken; but he is now hid at my Lord’s till night, that he do intend to make his escape away.

1661-02-03 14:15 r And how Sir Phillip Warwick’s lady did wonder to have Mr. Darcy send for several dozen bottles of Rhenish wine to her house, not knowing that the wine was his.

1661-02-03 14:10   To Mr. Fox’s, unbid; where I had a good dinner. Among other discourse, I observed one story, how my Lord of Northwich, at a public audience before the King of France, made the Duke of Anjou cry, by making ugly faces as he was stepping to the King, but undiscovered.

1661-02-03 12:15 r To White Hall; where I staid to hear the trumpets and kettle-drums, and then the other drums, which are much cried up, though I think it dull, vulgar musique.

1661-02-03 11:20   To Whitehall. In my way heard Mr. Thomas Fuller preach at the Savoy upon our forgiving of other men’s trespasses, showing among other things that we are to go to law never to revenge, but only to repayre, which I think a good distinction.

1661-02-03 09:10   This day I first begun to go forth in my coat and sword, as the manner now among gentlemen is.


1661-02-02 22:20   Comes Sir W. Pen, pretty merry, to sit with me and talk, which we did for an hour or two, and so good night, and I to bed.

1661-02-02 16:10   Home; where I found the parson and his wife gone. And by and by the rest of the company, very well pleased, and I too; it being the last dinner I intend to make a great while, it having now cost me almost 15l. in three dinners within this fortnight.

1661-02-02 13:30 r There dined here my uncle Wight and my aunt, my father and mother, and my brother Tom, Dr. Fairbrother and Mr. Mills, the parson, and his wife, who is a neighbour’s daughter of my uncle Robert’s, and knows my Aunt Wight and all her and my friends there; we had excellent company.

1661-02-02 11:30   Home, where all things in a hurry for dinner, a strange cook being come in the room of Slater, who could not come.

1661-02-02 07:05   To Mr. Moore, and with him to Sir Peter Ball, who proffers my uncle Robert much civility in letting him continue in the grounds which he had hired of Hetley who is now dead.


1661-02-01 22:10   So after a little music to bed, leaving my people up getting things ready against tomorrow’s dinner.

1661-02-01 15:40   After dinner into London and bought some books, and a belt, and had my sword new furbished.

1661-02-01 11:10   A full office all this morning, and busy about answering the Commissioners of Parliament to their letter, wherein they desire to borrow two clerks of ours, which we will not grant them.
