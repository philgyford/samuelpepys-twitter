1661-05-31 21:10   Great talk now how the Parliament intend to make a collection of free gifts to the King through the Kingdom; but I think it will not come to much.

1661-05-31 10:55 r I did talk to her so as did not indeed become me, but I could not help it, she being so unsufferably foolish and simple, so that my father, poor man, is become a very unhappy man.

1661-05-31 10:35 r But to my great grief I found my father and mother in a great deal of discontent one with another, and indeed my mother is grown now so pettish that I know not how my father is able to bear with it.

1661-05-31 10:30   I went to my father’s thinking to have met with my cozen John Holcroft, but he came not.


1661-05-30 22:00   This day, I hear, the Parliament have ordered a bill to be brought in for the restoring the Bishops to the House of Lords; which they had not done so soon but to spite Mr. Prin, who is every day so bitter against them in his discourse in the House.

1661-05-30 20:40   The Comptroller and I to the Coffee House, and there sat a great while talking of many things.

1661-05-30 11:00 r I took boat at Arundell stairs, and put in at Milford and there behind the doore of the stairs shit, there being a house of office there.

1661-05-30 10:30   To the Temple, and thence to Greatorex, who took me to Arundell-House, and there showed me some fine flowers in his garden, and all the fine statues in the gallery, which I formerly had seen, and is a brave sight.

1661-05-30 09:10   To the Wardrobe and there, with my Lord, went into his new barge to try her, and found her a good boat, and like my Lord’s contrivance of the door to come out round and not square as they used to do.


1661-05-29 17:20 r We took our leaves and away. In our way, we had great sport to try who should drive fastest, Sir W. Batten’s coach, or Sir W. Pen’s chariott, they having four, and we two horses, and we beat them. But it cost me the spoiling of my clothes and velvet coat with dirt.

1661-05-29 16:00 r All being done, we went to Mrs. Shipman’s, who is a great butter-woman, and I did see there the most of milk and cream, and the cleanest that ever I saw in my life.

1661-05-29 14:50 r But for as much I expected to give the name to the child, but did not (it being called John), I forbore then to give my plate till another time after a little more advice.

1661-05-29 14:35 r One passage of a lady that eat wafers with her dog did a little displease me. I did give the midwife 10s. and the nurse 5s. and the maid of the house 2s.

1661-05-29 14:20 r And there, before and after the christening; we were with the woman above in her chamber; but whether we carried ourselves well or ill, I know not; but I was directed by young Mrs. Batten.

1661-05-29 14:00 r To Mrs. Browne’s, where Sir W. Pen and I were godfathers, and Mrs. Jordan and Shipman godmothers to her boy.

1661-05-29 09:20 r Being come there heard Mr. Radcliffe, my former school fellow at Paul’s (who is yet a mere boy), preach upon “Nay, let him take all, since my Lord the King is returned,” &c. He reads all, and his sermon very simple, but I looked for new matter.

1661-05-29 07:10   Having made myself fine, and put six spoons and a porringer of silver in my pocket to give away today, Sir W. Pen and I took coach, and (the weather and ways being foul) went to Walthamstowe.


1661-05-28 14:40   To Cheapside about buying a piece of plate to give away tomorrow to Mrs. Browne’s child.

1661-05-28 10:50   To the Exchange about business, and there, by Mr. Rawlinson’s favour, got into a balcone over against the Exchange; and there saw the hangman burn, by vote of Parliament, two old acts, the one for constituting us a Commonwealth, and the others I have forgot.

1661-05-28 10:20   To the Wardrobe, and thence to a little alehouse hard by, to drink with John Bowles, who is now going to Hinchinbroke this day.


1661-05-27 22:10   Home and to bed.

1661-05-27 19:40 r The office done, I went with the Comptroller to the Coffee house, and there we discoursed of this, and I seem to be fond of him, and indeed I find I must carry fair with all as far as I see it safe, but I have got of him leave to have a little room from his lodgings to my house.

1661-05-27 17:20   To the office. Sir George Carteret did inquire into the naming of the maisters for this fleet, and was very angry that they were named as they are, and above all to see the maister of the Adventure turned out, who has been in her last.

1661-05-27 13:50 r There coming to us Captain Ferrers, this being the first day of his going abroad since his leap a week ago, which I was greatly glad to see.

1661-05-27 13:30   I went to Clerke’s at the Legg, and there I found both Mr. Pierces, Mr. Rolt, formerly too great a man to meet upon such even terms, and there we dined very merry.


1661-05-26 16:00 r Here I heard how Mrs. Browne, Sir W. Batten’s sister, is brought to bed, and I to be one of the godfathers, which I could not nor did deny.

1661-05-26 15:40   I to Sir W. Batten’s, where I have on purpose made myself a great stranger, only to get a high opinion a little more of myself in them.

1661-05-26 13:10   Dined with my wife alone at home pleasing myself in that my house do begin to look as if at last it would be in good order.


1661-05-25 18:10 r Homewards, and in my way bought “The Bondman” in Paul’s Churchyard, and so home, where I found all clean, and the hearth and range, as it is now enlarged, set up, which pleases me very much.

1661-05-25 17:30   To the Temple, where I staid and looked over a book or two at Playford’s, and then to the Theatre, where I saw a piece of “The Silent Woman,” which pleased me.


1661-05-24 20:40 r Then down to the kitchen to eat a bit of bread and butter, which I did, and there I took one of the maids by the chin, thinking her to be Susan, but it proved to be her sister, who is very like her.

1661-05-24 19:30   I went to the Wardrobe, where I found my Lord at supper, and therefore I walked a good while till he had done, and I went in to him, and there he looked over my accounts.

1661-05-24 12:10   At home all the morning making up my private accounts, and this is the first time that I do find myself to be clearly worth 500l. in money, besides all my goods in my house, &c.


1661-05-23 20:00   This day was kept a holy-day through the town; and it pleased me to see the little boys walk up and down in procession with their broom-staffs in their hands, as I had myself long ago gone.

1661-05-23 13:50 r Dr. Bates’s singularity in not rising up nor drinking the King’s nor other healths at the table was very much observed.

1661-05-23 13:10 r At table I had very good discourse with Mr. Ashmole, wherein he did assure me that frogs and many insects do often fall from the sky, ready formed.

1661-05-23 12:30 r Home by water, and there shifted myself into my black silk suit (the first day I have put it on this year), and so to my Lord Mayor’s by coach, with a great deal of honourable company, and great entertainment.

1661-05-23 10:25 r And spoke very many things, not so much to prove the Scripture false as that the time therein is not well computed nor understood.

1661-05-23 10:10   To the Rhenish wine house, and there came Jonas Moore, the mathematician, to us, and there he did by discourse make us fully believe that England and France were once the same continent, by very good arguments.


1661-05-22 22:10   Before I went to bed the barber came to trim me and wash me, and so to bed, in order to my being clean tomorrow.

1661-05-22 12:50   I and W. Howe by water to the Wardrobe, where my Lord and all the officers of the Wardrobe dined, and several other friends of my Lord, at a venison pasty. Before dinner, my Lady Wright and my Lady Jem. sang songs to the harpsicon.


1661-05-21 15:40   I went to my father’s, and there did give order about some clothes to be made, and did buy a new hat, cost between 20 and 30 shillings, at Mr. Holden’s.

1661-05-21 13:30   While we were upon the water, one of the greatest showers of rain fell that ever I saw.

1661-05-21 13:10 r And so took barge again, and were overtaken by the King in his barge, he having been down the river with his yacht this day for pleasure to try it; and, as I hear, Commissioner Pett’s do prove better than the Dutch one, and that that his brother built.

1661-05-21 12:20 r We took boat to Woolwich, where we staid and gave order for the fitting out of some more ships presently. And then to Deptford, where we staid and did the same.

1661-05-21 08:50   With Sir R. Slingsby (and Major Waters the deaf gentleman, his friend, for company’s sake) to the Victualling-office (the first time that I ever knew where it was), and there staid while he read a commission for enquiry into some of the King’s lands and houses thereabouts.


1661-05-20 16:40   I found Sir Williams both, choosing of masters for the new fleet of ships that is ordered to be set forth, and Pen seeming to be in an ugly humour, not willing to gratify one that I mentioned to be put in, did vex me.

1661-05-20 14:50   Mr. Creed came to me, and he and I to the Exchange, and so to an ordinary to dinner, and after dinner to the Mitre, and there sat drinking while it rained very much.


1661-05-19 18:10 r I took leave and supped at my father’s, where was my cozen Beck come lately out of the country. I am troubled to see my father so much decay of a suddain, as he do both in his seeing and hearing.

1661-05-19 15:10 r We sent for a doctor and chyrurgeon, but none to be found, till by-and-by by chance comes in Dr. Clerke, who is afeard of him.

1661-05-19 14:50 r With this, my Lord (who was in the little new room) come to us in amaze, and bid us carry him up, which, by our strength, we did, and so laid him in East’s bed, by the door; where he lay in great pain.

1661-05-19 14:45 r So we went down into the garden and dragged him to the bench, where he looked like a dead man, but could not stir; and, though he had broke nothing, yet his pain in his back was such as he could not endure.

1661-05-19 14:42 r I run to see what was become of him, and we found him crawled upon his knees, but could not rise.

1661-05-19 14:40 r With that thought I shut the doors, and W. Howe hindered him all we could; yet he opened them again, and, with a vault, leaps down into the garden: the greatest and most desperate frolic that ever I saw in my life.

1661-05-19 14:38 r Now it fell out so that the balcone windows were open, and he went to the rayle and made an offer to leap over, and asked what if he should leap over there. I told him I would give him 40l. if he did not go to sea.

1661-05-19 14:33 r But he swears that he would go, if he were sure never to come back again; and I, giving him some hopes, he grew so mad with joy that he fell a-dancing and leaping like a madman.

1661-05-19 14:30 r To my Lord’s, where we went and sat talking and laughing in the drawing-room a great while. All our talk about their going to sea this voyage, which Capt. Ferrers is in some doubt whether he shall go or no.

1661-05-19 13:40 r Capt. Ferrers and Mr. Howe and myself to Mr. Wilkinson’s at the Crown, and though he had no meat of his own, yet we happened to find our cook Mr. Robinson there, who had a dinner for himself and some friends, and so he did give us a very fine dinner.

1661-05-19 11:50 r Into the garden, and walked a turn or two, but found it not so fine a place as I always took it for by the outside.

1661-05-19 11:00   I walked towards Westminster, and seeing many people at York House, I went down and found them at mass, it being the Spanish ambassodors; and so I go into one of the gallerys, and there heard two masses done, I think, not in so much state as I have seen them heretofore.


1661-05-18 17:40   I home, where I staid all the afternoon in the garden reading “Faber Fortunae” with great pleasure.

1661-05-18 10:50 r So, I went ashore at Westminster; and to the Hall I went, where it was very pleasant to see the Hall in the condition it is now with the judges on the benches at the further end of it, which I had not seen all this term till now.

1661-05-18 09:35 r But upon, the start, the wager boats fell foul one of another, till at last one of them gives over, pretending foul play, and so the other row away alone, and all our sport lost.

1661-05-18 09:30 r So spying of Payne in a gully, I went into him, and there staid, thinking to have gone to Chelsy with them.

1661-05-18 09:15 r Being through bridge I found the Thames full of boats and gallys, and upon inquiry found that there was a wager to be run this morning.

1661-05-18 09:00   Towards Westminster, from the Towre, by water, and was fain to stand upon one of the piers about the bridge, before the men could drag their boat through the lock, and which they could not do till another was called to help them.


1661-05-17 22:20   Home to my musique, and my wife and I sat singing in my chamber a good while together, and then to bed.

1661-05-17 13:40   Lieutenant Lambert came to me, and to an ordinary, where to our dinner we had a fellow play well upon the bagpipes and whistle like a bird exceeding well, and I had a fancy to learn to whistle as he do, and did promise to come some other day and give him an angell to teach me.


1661-05-16 20:50 r And so we, with the rest of the servants in the hall, sat down and eat of the best cold meats that ever I eat on in all my life.

1661-05-16 19:40   Meeting Mr. Creed I took him by water to the Wardrobe with me, and there we found my Lord newly gone away with the Duke of Ormond and some others, whom he had had to the collation.

1661-05-16 17:30 r I give them very respectful answer and so went away to the Theatre, and there saw the latter end of “The Mayd’s Tragedy,” which I never saw before, and methinks it is too sad and melancholy.

1661-05-16 15:20 r Quite contrary to my expectations, they did treat me very civilly, telling me that what they had done was out of zeal to the King’s service, and that they would joyne with the governors of the chest with all their hearts, since they knew that there was any.

1661-05-16 14:50   I went in my velvet coat by water to the Savoy, and there, having staid a good while, I was called into the Lords.


1661-05-15 22:10   To bed, being in great fear because of the shavings which lay all up and down the house and cellar, for fear of fire.

1661-05-15 16:10   There came two men with an order from a Committee of Lords to demand some books of me out of the office, but I give them a surly answer, and they went away to complain which put me into some trouble with myself, but I resolve to go tomorrow myself to these Lords and answer them.

1661-05-15 14:20   Home and found all my joyner’s work now done, but only a small job or two, which please me very well.


1661-05-14 22:40 r Finding my head grow weak now-a-days if I come to drink wine, and therefore hope that I shall leave it off of myself, which I pray God I could do.

1661-05-14 21:50 r My uncle Wight, Mr. Talbot, and others were with us, and we were pretty merry.

1661-05-14 19:40   Mr. Shepley came to me for some money, and so he and I to the Mitre, and there we had good wine and a gammon of bacon.

1661-05-14 08:40   My Lord told me of his intention to get the Muster Master’s place for Mr. Pierce, the purser, who he has a mind to carry to sea with him, and spoke very slightingly of Mr. Creed, as that he had no opinion at all of him, but only he was forced to make use of him.


1661-05-13 20:10   The office being done I went home and took pleasure to see my work draw to an end.

1661-05-13 13:00   Mr. Creed and I went to the ordinary behind the Exchange, where we lately were, but I do not like it so well as I did.


1661-05-12 18:55 r I home, much wondering to see how things are altered with Mr. Creed, who, twelve months ago, might have been got to hang himself almost as soon as go to a drinking-house on a Sunday.

1661-05-12 18:30   Met with Mr. Creed, with whom I went and walked in Grayes-Inn-walks, and from thence to Islington, and there eat and drank at the house my father and we were wont of old to go to; and after that walked homeward, and parted in Smithfield.

1661-05-12 15:40   At the Savoy heard Dr. Fuller preach upon David’s words, “I will wait with patience all the days of my appointed time until my change comes;” but methought it was a poor dry sermon. And I am afeard my former high esteem of his preaching was more out of opinion than judgment.

1661-05-12 06:50 r I put in a vent (which Dr. Williams sent me yesterday) into the hole to keep it open till all the matter be come out, and so I question not that she will soon be well again.

1661-05-12 06:45   My wife had a very troublesome night this night and in great pain, but about the morning her swelling broke, and she was in great ease presently as she useth to be.


1661-05-11 20:50   Mr. Hater brought my last quarter’s salary, of which I was very glad, because I have lost my first bill for it, and so this morning was forced to get another signed by three of my fellow officers for it.

1661-05-11 20:20   Calling at my father’s, I went home, and there staid and saw my workmen follow their work, which this night is brought to a very good condition.

1661-05-11 11:10   I went to Graye’s Inne, and there to a barber’s, where I was trimmed, and had my hair cut, in which I am lately become a little curious, finding that the length of it do become me very much.

1661-05-11 09:30   I went by water with Payne (Mr. Moore being with me) to my Lord Chamberlain at Whitehall, and there spoke with my Lord, and he did accept of Payne for his waterman, as I had lately endeavoured to get him to be.


1661-05-10 18:40   Came Mr. Blackburn and Creed to see me, and I took them to the Dolphin, and there drank a great deal of Rhenish wine with them and so home.

1661-05-10 16:10   At the office all the morning, and the afternoon among my workmen with great pleasure, because being near an end of their work.

1661-05-10 14:30   Mr. Hater received for me the 225l. due upon Mr. Creed’s bill in which I am concerned so much, which do make me very glad.


1661-05-09 22:30 r By and by comes in my Lord, and so, after looking over my accounts, I returned home, being a dirty and dark walk. So to bed.

1661-05-09 21:50   I walked to the Wardrobe, being the first time I was there since my Lady came thither, who I found all alone, and so she showed me all the lodgings as they are now fitted, and they seem pretty pleasant.

1661-05-09 14:40   I meeting with Mr. Childe took him to the Swan Tavern in King Street, and there did give him a tankard of white wine and sugar.

1661-05-09 11:50   With my workmen all the morning, my wife being ill and in great pain with her old pain, which troubled me much because that my house is in this condition of dirt.


1661-05-08 22:20   I set down my journal of my late journey to this time, and so to bed. My wife not being well and I very angry with her for her coming hither in that condition.

1661-05-08 20:42 r But it vexed me to see how my uncle writes to me, as if he were not able to buy him one. But I intend tomorrow to send him one.

1661-05-08 20:40   I received a letter from my uncle, to beg an old fiddle of me for my Cozen Perkin, the miller, whose mill the wind hath lately broke down, and now he hath nothing to live by but fiddling, and he must needs have it against Whitsuntide to play to the country girls.

1661-05-08 19:10   Comes my wife not well from my father’s, having had a fore-tooth drawn out today, which do trouble me, and the more because I am now in the greatest of all my dirt.

1661-05-08 18:20   All this day I staid at home with my workmen without eating anything, and took much pleasure to see my work go forward.

1661-05-08 08:20   Came my brother John to take his leave of me, he being to return to Cambridge tomorrow, and after I had chid him for going with my Will the other day to Deptford with the principal officers, I did give him some good counsell and 20s. in money, and so he went away.


1661-05-07 22:10   To bed, having sent my Lord a letter tonight to excuse myself for not going with him tomorrow to the Hope, whither he is to go to see in what condition the fleet is in.

1661-05-07 18:10   Home and staid among my workmen all day, and took order for things for the finishing of their work.

1661-05-07 13:40 r He carried me to an ordinary by the Old Exchange, where we come too late, but we had very good cheer for our 18d. a-piece, and an excellent droll too, my host, and his wife so fine a woman; and sung and played so well that I staid a great while and drunk a great deal of wine.

1661-05-07 09:40   With Mr. Creed into London, to several places about his and my business, being much stopped in our way by the City traynebands, who go in much solemnity and pomp this day to muster before the King and the Duke, and shops in the City are shut up every where all this day.


1661-05-06 21:50   I hear tonight that the Duke of York’s son is this day dead, which I believe will please every body; and I hear that the Duke and his Lady themselves are not much troubled at it.

1661-05-06 21:20   I sent my wife to my father’s, and I went and sat till late with my Lady Batten, both the Sir Williams being gone this day to pay off some ships at Deptford.

1661-05-06 12:00 r We went on, thinking to be at home before the officers rose, but finding we could not we staid by the way and eat some cakes, and so home. Where I was much troubled to see no more work done in my absence than there was, but it could not be helped.

1661-05-06 04:55   Up by four o’clock and took coach. Mr. Creed rode, and left us that we know not whither he went.


1661-05-05 21:10 r To supper in the banquet house, and there my wife and I did talk high, she against and I for Mrs. Pierce (that she was a beauty), till we were both angry.

1661-05-05 15:40 r We walked into the garden, and there played the fool a great while, trying who of Mr. Creed or I could go best over the edge of an old fountain well, and I won a quart of sack of him.

1661-05-05 11:30   Mr. Creed and I went to the red-faced Parson’s church, and heard a good sermon of him, better than I looked for.


1661-05-04 22:15 r We lay at the Red Lyon, the best Inn, and lay in the room the King lately lay in.

1661-05-04 22:00 r So to supper, and to bed, being very merry about our discourse with the Drawers concerning the minister of the Town, with a red face and a girdle.

1661-05-04 17:00   Took coach, and so to Gilford, where we had time to see the Hospital, built by Archbishop Abbott, and the free school, and were civilly treated by the Mayster.


1661-05-03 22:20 r Here my wife and I lay in the room the Queen lately lay at her going into France.

1661-05-03 17:30 r We to Petersfield, having nothing more of trouble in all my journey, but the exceeding unmannerly and most epicure-like palate of Mr. Creed.

1661-05-03 13:10 r To the payhouse, and there paid off the ship, and so to a short dinner, and then took coach, leaving Mrs. Hater there to stay with her husband’s friends.

1661-05-03 07:50   Early to walk with Mr. Creed up and down the town, and it was in his and some others’ thoughts to have got me made free of the town, but the Mayor, it seems, unwilling, and so they could not do it.


1661-05-02 16:20 r Then we and our wives all to see the Montagu, which is a fine ship, and so to the town again by water, and then to see the room where the Duke of Buckingham was killed by Felton.

1661-05-02 15:40 r Back and brought them all to dinner with me, and treated them handsomely; and so after dinner by water to the Yard, and there we made the sale of the old provisions.

1661-05-02 11:10   Up, and Mr. Creed and I to walk round the town upon the walls. Then to our inn, and there all the officers of the Yard to see me with great respect, and I walked with them to the Dock and saw all the stores, and much pleased with the sight of the place.


1661-05-01 21:20 r Several officers of the Yard came to see us tonight, and merry we were, but troubled to have no better lodgings.

1661-05-01 13:50 r Then we set forth again, and so to Portsmouth, seeming to me to be a very pleasant and strong place; and we lay at the Red Lyon, where Haselrigge and Scott and Walton did hold their councill, when they were here, against Lambert and the Committee of Safety.

1661-05-01 09:00   Up early, and bated at Petersfield, in the room which the King lay in lately at his being there. Here very merry, and played us and our wives at bowls.
