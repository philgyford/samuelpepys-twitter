1660-01-31 22:00   I could find nothing in Mr Downing’s letter concerning my office; but I could discern that Hawly had a mind I would be Clerk of the Council.

1660-01-31 17:30   I found Mrs. Jem among the people below at work and she came up hot and merry, as if they had given her wine, at which I was troubled.

1660-01-31 15:10   To Westminster Hall, where all we clerks had orders to wait upon the Committee, at the Star Chamber that is to try Colonel Jones.

1660-01-31 11:00   Mr. Hawly newly come from shipboard from his master brought me a letter of direction what to do in his lawsuit with Squib about his house.

1660-01-31 09:40   I fell to my lute till 9 o’clock. Then to my Lord’s lodgings and set out a barrel of soap to be carried to Mrs. Ann.

1660-01-30 21:30   Spent a little time this night in knocking up nails for my hat and cloaks in my chamber.

1660-01-30 20:00   There seems now to be a general cease of talk, it being taken for granted that Monk do resolve to stand to the Parliament, and nothing else.

1660-01-30 16:30   I went and sat awhile and played at cards with Mrs. Jem, whose maid had newly got an ague and was ill thereupon.

1660-01-30 07:30   I fell a-singing of “Great, good, and just,” &c. and put myself in mind that this was the fatal day, ten years since, his Majesty died.

1660-01-29 20:30   By my father I understand that my uncle Fenner and my aunt were much pleased with our entertaining them.

1660-01-29 17:00   I spent the afternoon in casting up my accounts, and do find myself to be worth 40l. and more, which I did not think.

1660-01-28 14:30   I went to Heaven, where Luellin and I dined on a breast of mutton all alone, discoursing of the changes that we have seen.

1660-01-28 11:21   I went down and sent a porter to my house for my best fur cap, but he coming too late with it I did not present it to Mr. Downing.

1660-01-28 11:10   Mr. Downing took a very civil leave of me, beyond my expectation. I was afraid that he would have told me of removing me from my office.

1660-01-28 09:15   Mr. Downing told me that he was resolved to be gone for Holland this morning.

1660-01-28 08:30   I went to Mr. Downing and carried him three characters, and then to my office and wrote another, while Mr. Frost staid telling money.

1660-01-27 23:50   I fell a writing the characters for Mr. Downing, and I sat up till almost twelve writing, and wrote two of them.

1660-01-27 15:00   Coming home my wife told me that Mr. Hawly had been there to speak with me, and seemed angry that I had not been at the office that day.

1660-01-27 14:10   To Mr. G. Montagu’s house, and was forced to dine with him, and had a brave dinner and the greatest civility that ever I had from any man.

1660-01-26 23:00   The news this day is a letter that speaks absolutely Monk’s concurrence with this Parliament, and nothing else, which yet I hardly believe.

1660-01-26 21:20   I fell to writing of two characters for Mr. Downing, and carried them to him, and he did not like them but corrected them.

1660-01-26 15:20   We were as merry as I could frame myself to be in the company, W. Joyce talking after the old rate and drinking hard, vexed his father.

1660-01-26 13:41   …a dish of fowl, three pullets, two dozen larks in a dish; a great tart, a neat’s tongue, a dish of anchovies; a dish of prawns and cheese.

1660-01-26 13:30   To my Lord’s lodgings where my wife had got ready a very fine dinner. viz. a dish of marrow bones; a leg of mutton; a loin of veal;…

1660-01-25 23:00   To my Lord’s and got most things ready against tomorrow, and my wife was making of her tarts and larding of her pullets till eleven o’clock.

1660-01-25 18:20   Mr. Evans, my Lady Wright's butler, had me into his buttery, and gave me sack and a lesson on his lute, which he played very well.

1660-01-25 17:00   I called at Paul’s Churchyard, where I bought Buxtorf’s Hebrew Grammar; and read a declaration of the gentlemen of Northampton.

1660-01-25 14:40   I heard that in Cheapside there had been a gibbet set up, and the picture of Huson hung upon it in the middle of the street.

1660-01-25 14:00   By water to my Uncle White’s to dinner, where I met my father, where we alone had a fine jole of Ling to dinner.

1660-01-24 20:30   The Parliament gave order that the late Committee of Safety should come before them, and all their papers, and their model of Government.

1660-01-24 17:15   My father and I spoke privately in the little room to my sister Pall about stealing of things as my wife’s scissars and my maid’s book.

1660-01-24 14:55   Mr. Southerne, and Lambert, brought with them the declaration from the Parliament, wherein they declare for law and gospel, and for tythes.

1660-01-24 14:30   Mr. Lucy and several other gentlemen coming in after dinner, swearing and singing as if they were mad, only he singing very handsomely.

1660-01-24 14:15   There was pulling off Mrs. bride’s and Mr. bridegroom’s ribbons; with a great deal of fooling among them that I and my wife did not like.

1660-01-24 14:00   We found Mrs. Carrick very fine, and one Mr. Lucy, who called one another husband and wife, and after dinner a great deal of mad stir.

1660-01-24 11:30   Took my wife to Mr. Pierces, she in the way being exceedingly troubled with a pair of new pattens, and I vexed to go so slow, it being late.

1660-01-24 00:00   I met with Simons and Luellin, and went with them to Mr. Mount’s at the Cock Pit, where we had some rare pot venison, and ale to abundance.

1660-01-23 18:30   I paid Mrs. Michell, my bookseller, and back to Whitehall, and, going through to the Stone Gallery I fell into a ditch, it being very dark.

1660-01-23 15:40   I went out and paid Waters, and went to see Mrs. Jem, where I found my Lady Wright, but Scott was so drunk that he could not be seen.

1660-01-23 10:50   Came home and found my wife dressing of the girl’s head, by which she was made to look very pretty.

1660-01-23 10:00   Called out to carry 20l. to Mr. Downing, and finding Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, I took him to the Axe and gave him his morning draft.

1660-01-22 21:45   This day I began to put on buckles to my shoes, which I have bought yesterday of Mr. Wotton.

1660-01-22 17:15   To church to Mr. Herring, where a lazy poor sermon.

1660-01-22 15:00   My father shewed me a letter from Mr. Widdrington, of Christ’s College, wherein he do express very great kindness for my brother.

1660-01-22 12:55   By appointment my wife met me, and so to my father’s to dinner, where we had not been to my shame in a fortnight before.

1660-01-22 12:05   To Mr Messum’s. A sermon about the duty of all to give good example in our lives and conversation, which he himself was guilty of not doing.

1660-01-21 19:30   Poor Mr. Cook, that is like to be put out of his clerk’s place, came and railed at me for endeavouring to put him out and get myself in.

1660-01-21 10:40   To my office where nothing to do.

1660-01-21 09:10   To Mr. Downing who chid me because I did not give him notice of some of his guests failed him.

1660-01-20 21:40   This day three citizens of London went to meet Monk from the Common Council.

1660-01-20 17:30   To Westminster Hall where Mrs. Lane and the rest of the maids had their white scarfs, all having been at the burial of a young bookseller.

1660-01-20 15:15   I went to the Coffee Club where there was nothing done but choosing of a Committee for orders.

1660-01-20 14:30   By water with Mr. Maylard and Hales to the Swan in Fish Street at our colly feast, where we were very merry at our Jole of Ling.

1660-01-19 22:10   To bed.

1660-01-19 19:00   With all the Clerks of the Council, and they do all tell me that my name was mentioned the last night, but that nothing was done in it.

1660-01-19 14:50   To the French Ordinary, where Mr. Downing this day feasted Sir Arth. Haselrigge, and did stay to put him in mind of me.

1660-01-19 10:50   To Whitehall where I met with Sir Ant. Cooper and did give him some answer from my Lord and he did give us leave to keep the lodgings still.

1660-01-19 09:10   I feared that Mr. Downing’s doing of it was but only to ease himself of the salary which he gives me.

1660-01-19 08:56   I was a little stumbled, and could not tell what to do, whether to thank Mr. Downing or no; but by and by I did; but not very heartily.

1660-01-19 08:45   Mr. Downing told me that he had a kindness for me; and that was that he had got me to be one of the Clerks of the Council.

1660-01-18 20:45   The world is at a loss to think what Monk will do: the City saying that he will be for them, and the Parliament saying he will be for them.

1660-01-18 14:15   To Wilkinson’s, where we had a dinner for Mr. Talbot, Adams, Pinkny and his son, but his son did not come. Here we were very merry.

1660-01-17 15:40   Mr. Moore told me the reason of his melancholy was unkindness from Mrs. Jane after great expressions of love.

1660-01-17 10:00   At Kensington we understood how that my Lord Chesterfield had killed another gentleman about half an hour before, and was fled.

1660-01-17 09:00   I took Mr. Woodfine to Will’s and drank with him. Thence to the coach, where my wife was ready, and so we went towards Twickenham.

1660-01-17 01:00   I staid up till the bell-man came by just under my window, and cried, “Past one of the clock, and a cold, frosty, windy morning.”

1660-01-16 21:00   I played on my flageolet, and staid there till nine o’clock, very merry and drawn on with one song after another till it came to be so late.

1660-01-16 19:50   To the Green Dragon, on Lambeth Hill, and there we sang of all sorts of things, and I ventured with good success upon things at first sight.

1660-01-16 14:50   After dinner we had pretty good singing, and Hazard sung alone after the old fashion, which was very much cried up, but I did not like it.

1660-01-16 10:40   Mr. Downing did mention to me his going back into Holland, and did ask me whether I would go or no, but gave me little encouragement.

1660-01-16 09:10   I went to Mr. Crew’s, and he gave me direction to go to-morrow with Mr. Edward to Twickenham, and did talk to me concerning things of state.

1660-01-15 21:00   It being a cold day and a great snow my physic did not work so well as it should have done.

1660-01-15 12:50   My brother John came to me, and I corrected his Greek speech to say the Apposition, though I believe he was as well able to do it as myself.

1660-01-15 09:30   Having been exceedingly disturbed in the night with the barking of a dog that I could not sleep for an hour or two, I slept late.

1660-01-14 19:40   To the Coffee-house, and heard argument against Mr. Harrington’s assertion, that overbalance of propriety was the foundation of government.

1660-01-14 11:50   I met with Captain Holland, who told me that he hath brought his wife to my house, so I posted home and got a dish of meat for them.

1660-01-13 21:30   I went home and found my wife gone abroad to Mr. Hunt’s, and came in a little after me.

1660-01-13 19:10   To Mr. Vines, where he and I and Mr. Hudson played half-a-dozen things, there being there Dick’s wife and her sister.

1660-01-13 17:30   I went to Mrs. Jem, and found her up and merry, and that it did not prove the small-pox, but only the swine-pox.

1660-01-13 16:20   My wife was unwilling to let me go forth. I saw she followed me, and so I took her round through Whitehall, and so carried her home angry.

1660-01-13 10:10   To my office, where nothing to do. So to Will’s with Mr. Pinkney, who invited me to their feast at his Hall the next Monday.

1660-01-13 09:00   Mr. Fage told me that Monk’s letter that came to them by the sword-bearer was a cunning piece, and that which they did not much trust to.

1660-01-12 21:50   I went to bed, and in discourse broke to my wife what my thoughts were concerning my design of getting money by, &c.

1660-01-12 18:10   Finding my letters this day not gone by the carrier I new sealed them, but my brother Tom coming we fell into discourse.

1660-01-12 14:20   To the Half Moon, where I found the Captain and Mr. Billingsly, where we were merry, and had the man that plays so well on the Welsh harp.

1660-01-12 11:00   I drink my morning at Harper’s with Mr. Sheply and a seaman, and so to my office where Captain Holland appointed a meeting in the afternoon.

1660-01-11 19:50   I went to see Mrs. Jem, who was in bed, and now granted to have the small-pox.

1660-01-11 17:30   To Mr. Steven’s with a pair of silver snuffers, and bought a pair of shears to cut silver, and so homeward again.

1660-01-11 17:10   I went towards London, and in my way went in to see Crowly, who was now grown a very great loon and very tame.

1660-01-11 15:15   After a game at shittle-cock with Mr. Walgrave and Mr. Edward, I returned to my father, and went to an alehouse.

1660-01-11 11:30   Being at Will’s with Captain Barker, who hath paid me 300l. this morning, in comes my father, and with him I walked.

1660-01-10 21:10   I went home and wrote a letter, and went to Harper’s, and staid there till Tom carried it to the postboy at Whitehall.

1660-01-10 19:40   With Doling to Mother Lams, who told me how this day Scott was made Intelligencer.

1660-01-10 19:00   To the Coffee-house, where were a great confluence of gentlemen; viz Mr. Harrington, Poultny, Gold, Dr Petty; &c, where admirable discourse.

1660-01-10 17:10   To Westminster, overtaking Captain Okeshott in his silk cloak, whose sword got hold of many people in walking.

1660-01-10 14:45   Jenings and I into London (it being through heat of the sun a great thaw and dirty), and coming back drank a pint of wine at the Star.

1660-01-10 12:30   Into the Hall, and meeting the Quarter Master, Jenings, and Captain Rider, we four went to a cook’s to dinner.

1660-01-10 07:40   In my way met with Greatorex, and at an alehouse he showed me the first sphere of wire that ever he made, and indeed it was very pleasant.

1660-01-09 22:00   Mr. Hawly told me that I must pay all the money that I have, at which I was put to a great loss how I should get money to make up my cash.

1660-01-09 19:35   I heard how the nine officers that had their commissions taken away from them, were commanded to their farthest houses from London.

1660-01-09 18:15   To Mrs. Jem’s, and found her in bed, and she was afraid that it would prove the small-pox.

1660-01-09 17:30   Into the Hall, where I heard for certain that Monk was coming to London, and that Bradshaw’s lodgings were preparing for him.

1660-01-09 11:00   Scobel was called to the bar for entering in the journal for 1653: “This day his Excellence the Lord General Cromwell dissolved this House.”

1660-01-09 09:45   I found Muddiman a good scholar, an arch rogue; though he writes new books for the Parliament, he did declare he did it only to get money.

1660-01-09 08:55   I have been troubled with thoughts how to get money to pay them that I have borrowed money of, my money being in my uncle’s hands.

1660-01-08 13:15   To my father’s, where I found my wife, who was forced to dine there, we not having one coal of fire, and it being very hard frosty weather.

1660-01-08 11:45   To Mr. Gunning’s, where a good sermon, wherein he told us good authority for us to believe that Christ did follow his father’s trade.

1660-01-07 22:35   And so we went home, and put in at my Lord’s lodgings, where we staid late, eating of his turkey-pie, and reading of Quarles’ Emblems.

1660-01-07 20:20   I went to Dr. Whores, where I heard some symphony and songs of his own making, performed by Mr. May, Harding, and Mallard.

1660-01-07 18:45   A great deal of discourse with one of the Embassador's gentlemen concerning the difference between the zeal of the French and the Spaniard.

1660-01-07 17:30   A messenger from Mr. Downing came to fetch me, so I went and was forced to stay in expectation of the French Embassador, who at last came.

1660-01-07 12:45   I took Mrs. Turner, Theoph. Madame Morrice, and Joyce, home to my house, and I got a dish of steaks and a rabbit for them.

1660-01-06 21:00   To my cosen, where, after a good supper, we had a brave cake brought us, and in the choosing, Pall was Queen and Mr. Stradwick was King.

1660-01-06 16:35   I went to Westminster to Mr. Vines, where George and I fiddled a good while, Dick and his wife and her sister being there.

1660-01-06 13:15   Went to my cosen, and found them just sat down to dinner, which was good; only the venison pasty was palpable beef, which was not handsome.

1660-01-06 08:30   Mr. Sheply and I did eat our breakfast at Mrs. Harper’s, (my brother John being with me) upon a cold turkey-pie and a goose.

1660-01-05 20:56   Mr. Fage told me it is true the City had not time enough to do much, but they are resolved to shake off the soldiers.

1660-01-05 20:45   I left my wife playing at cards, and went with my lanthorn to Mr. Fage, to consult concerning my nose, who told me it was nothing but cold.

1660-01-05 20:00   My wife and I, it being a great frost, went to Mrs. Jem’s, in expectation to eat a sack-posset, but Mr. Edward not coming it was put off.

1660-01-05 19:11   Monk and Fairfax were commanded up to town, and the Prince’s lodgings are to be provided for Monk at Whitehall.

1660-01-05 19:00   The Parliament hath this night voted that the members that were discharged from sitting in the years 1648 and 49, were duly discharged.

1660-01-05 17:00   And so to my office again; where the Excise money was brought, and some of it told to soldiers.

1660-01-05 13:00   I dined with Mr. Sheply, at my Lord’s lodgings, upon his turkey-pie.

1660-01-04 23:00   Home and so to bed, but much troubled with my nose, which was much swelled.

1660-01-04 22:00   Home, and from thence to Mr. Hunt’s, and sat with them and Mr. Hawly at cards, and was much made of by them.

1660-01-04 18:45   Certain news that my Lord Lambert his forces were all forsaking him, and that he did now declare for the Parliament himself.

1660-01-04 15:05   To Shaw, but I found him at cards with Spicer and D. Vines, and could not get him along with me. I was vext at this.

1660-01-04 13:30   Some say that Lambert must yield up; others, that he is strong and the Fifth-monarchy-men stick to him if he declares for a free Parliament.

1660-01-04 12:10   It snowed hard all this morning, and was very cold, and my nose was much swelled with cold.

1660-01-04 10:20   I met with the Clerk and Quarter Master of my Lord’s troop, and took them to the Swan and gave them their morning’s draft.

1660-01-04 09:55   I went down into the Hall and to Will’s, where Hawly brought a piece of his Cheshire cheese, and we were merry with it.

1660-01-04 07:45   Came Mr. Vanly to me for his half-year’s rent, which I had not in the house, but took his man to the office and there paid him.

1660-01-03 22:15   I went home, and there found Mr. Hunt and his wife, and Mr. Hawly, who sat with me till ten at night at cards, and so broke up and to bed.

1660-01-03 17:45   The Parliament voted that vacancies, by the death of the old members, shall be filled up; but those that are living shall not be called in.

1660-01-03 17:30   To White Hall, where I understood that the Parliament had passed the act for indemnity to the soldiers and officers that would come in.

1660-01-03 13:00   Went home, where Mrs. Jem, her maid, Mr. Sheply, Hawly, and Moore dined with me on a piece of beef and cabbage, and a collar of brawn.

1660-01-03 11:15   I went to Westminster, where I found soldiers in my office to receive money, and paid it them.

1660-01-03 08:55   I went out, it being a great frost, and walked to Mrs. Turner’s to stop her from coming to see me to-day, because of Mrs. Jem’s coming.

1660-01-03 07:30   My wife had a very bad night of it through wind and cold.

1660-01-02 21:50   Having not eaten anything but bread and cheese, my wife cut me a slice of brawn which I received from my Lady; as good as ever I had any.

1660-01-02 21:10   I went home, and finding my wife gone to see Mrs. Hunt, I went to Will’s, and there sat with Mr. Ashwell talking and singing, and so home.

1660-01-02 13:15   Mr. Moore and I and another gentleman went out and drank a cup of ale in the new market, and I eat some bread and cheese for my dinner.

1660-01-02 11:20   Great talk that many places have declared for a free Parliament; it is believed they will be forced to fill up the House with old members.

1660-01-02 10:30   The House was to-day upon finishing the act for the Council of State, which they did; and were to sit again thereupon in the afternoon.

1660-01-02 09:25   I went to Mr. Crew’s and borrowed 10l. of Mr. Andrewes for my own use, and so went to my office, where there was nothing to do.

1660-01-02 08:45   I went to Mr. Sheply who was drawing of sack in the cellar, and told me that my Lord had given him order to give me the dozen of bottles.

1660-01-02 08:05   Before I went forth old East brought me a dozen of bottles of sack, and I gave him a shilling for his pains.

1660-01-01 19:30   Went with my wife to my father’s, and in going observed the great posts which the City have set up at the Conduit in Fleet-street.

1660-01-01 17:10   I staid at home all the afternoon, looking over my accounts.

1660-01-01 14:20   Dined at home in the garret, where my wife dressed the remains of a turkey, and in the doing of it she burned her hand.

1660-01-01 12:00   Went to Mr. Gunning’s chapel, where he made a very good sermon: “That in the fulness of time God sent his Son, made of a woman,” &c.

1660-01-01 10:28   My own private condition very handsome, and esteemed rich, but indeed very poor; besides my office, which at present is somewhat uncertain.

1660-01-01 10:17   The new Common Council of the City sent to Monk their sword-bearer, to acquaint him with their desires for a free and full Parliament.

1660-01-01 10:06   Blessed be God, at the end of the last year I was in very good health, without any sense of my old pain, but upon taking of cold.

1660-01-01 08:25   I rose, put on my suit with great skirts, having not lately worn any other clothes but them.
