1660-04-30 23:50   To bed very late with drink enough in my head.

1660-04-30 22:30   W. Howe got my velvet studying cap and drew some ale into mine too, that we made ourselves a great deal of mirth, but spoiled my clothes.

1660-04-30 22:10   W. Howe pulls out the spigot of the little vessel of ale that was there in the cabin and drew some into his mounteere.

1660-04-30 21:20   Mr. Sheply, W. Howe and I up to the Lieutenant’s cabin, where we drank, and I and W. Howe were very merry.

1660-04-30 19:40   Pleasant my Lord was with Mr Creed and Sheply who he puzzled about the meaning of the three holes he had cut over the chrystal of his watch.

1660-04-30 17:20   The Captain did give us such music upon the harp by a fellow that he keeps on board that I never expect to hear the like again.

1660-04-30 16:40   To boat again, and went to the Assistance, where we were treated very civilly by the Captain.

1660-04-30 15:25   We went to Fuller’s (the famous place for ale), but they have none but what was in the vat.

1660-04-30 15:00   We took boat and first went on shore, it being very pleasant in the fields; but a very pitiful town Deal is.

1660-04-30 14:45   W. Howe, Mr. Sheply and I got my Lord’s leave to go to see Captain Sparling.

1660-04-30 14:30   After dinner to ninepins, W. Howe and I against Mr. Creed and the Captain. We lost 5s. apiece to them.

1660-04-30 12:20   All the morning getting instructions ready for the Squadron of ships that are going to-day to the Streights.

1660-04-29 14:55   I walked a while upon the deck with the chyrurgeon and purser, and other officers of the ship, and they all pray for the King’s coming.

1660-04-29 11:40   A letter is come from the King to the House, which is locked up by the Council that it may be read in the open House when they meet again.

1660-04-29 11:00   All the young lords that were not in arms against the Parliament do now sit.

1660-04-28 21:50   After supper my Lord exceeding merry, and he and I and W. Howe to sing, and so to bed.

1660-04-28 16:40   I played at ninepins with Mr. Pickering, I and Mr. Pett against him and Ted Osgood, and won a crown apiece of him.

1660-04-27 23:10   Late reading my letters, my mind being much troubled to think that we should have any cause to fear any more disappointments therein.

1660-04-27 19:40   My Lord told me that the Presbyterians are deceived, for General Monk is certainly for the King’s interest.

1660-04-27 19:20   Mr. Moore fears the Cavaliers in the House will be so high, that the others will be forced to leave the House and fall in with General Monk.

1660-04-27 11:50   This morning Pim spent in my cabin, putting a great many ribbons to a suit.

1660-04-26 21:40   Some musique, where Mr. Pickering beginning to play a bass part upon the viall did it so like a fool that I was ashamed of him.

1660-04-26 18:20   Down with J. Goods into my Lord’s storeroom of wine, where it was very pleasant to observe the massy timbers that the ship is made of.

1660-04-26 17:10   I was writing of letters, among the rest one to W. Simons, Peter Luellin and Tom Doling which because it is somewhat merry I keep a copy of.

1660-04-26 15:20   My Lord told me how he did believe that the Cavaliers have now the upper hand clear of the Presbyterians.

1660-04-26 15:00   Twelve of the Lords chose my Lord of Manchester Speaker of the House of Lords and Sir Harbottle Grimstone, Speaker for the House of Commons.

1660-04-26 14:40   Came Mr. Donne back from London, who brought letters with him that signify the meeting of the Parliament yesterday.

1660-04-25 16:40   I gave the character my Lord, it being very handsomely done and a very good one in itself, but that not truly Alphabetical.

1660-04-25 14:10   Home, not a little contented to see how I am treated, and with what respect made a fellow to the best commanders in the Fleet.

1660-04-25 13:50   Dined to-day with Captain Clerke on board the Speaker (a very brave ship) where was the Vice-Admiral, Rear-Admiral, and other commanders.

1660-04-24 21:10   We had some more good musique and singing of “Turne Amaryllis,” as it is printed in the song book, with which my Lord was very much pleased.

1660-04-24 18:30   In the afternoon my Lord gave a great large character to write out, so I spent all the day about it.

1660-04-24 14:20   I went where there was many commanders, and pleasant we were on board the London, which hath a state-room much bigger than the Nazeby.

1660-04-23 21:40   My Lord fell to singing of a song made upon the Rump, with which he played himself well, to the tune of “The Blacksmith.”

1660-04-23 19:20   The first time that we had any sport among the seamen, and there was extraordinary good sport after my Lord had done playing at ninepins.

1660-04-23 12:10   Busy getting my packet ready for London, only for an hour or two had the Captain and Mr Sheply in my cabin at the barrel of pickled oysters.

1660-04-22 14:00   Several Londoners told us how the King’s Arms are every day set up in houses and churches.

1660-04-21 22:20   Late singing with W. Howe, and under the barber’s hands in the coach.

1660-04-21 16:40   The Captain treated me huge nobly, giving me a barrel of pickled oysters, and a bottle of wine, which was a very great favour.

1660-04-21 13:50   We heard how in many churches in London, and upon many signs there, and upon merchants’ ships in the river, they had set up the King’s arms.

1660-04-20 20:40   Mr. Edw. Montagu did go beyond sea when he was here first the other day, and I am apt to believe that he went to speak with the King.

1660-04-20 20:00   This evening my head ached exceedingly, which I impute to my sitting backwards in my cabin, otherwise than I am used to do.

1660-04-20 12:10   I was pleased to see what a command I have to have every one ready to come and go at my command.

1660-04-20 11:50   I was busy to get my window altered, and to have my table set as I would have it, which after it was done I was infinitely pleased with it.

1660-04-19 21:40   This day it has rained much, so that when I came to go to bed I found it wet through, so I was fain to wrap myself up in a dry sheet.

1660-04-19 17:10   A great deal of business all this day, and Burr being gone to shore without my leave did vex me much.

1660-04-19 12:45   At dinner news was brought us that my Lord was chosen at Dover.

1660-04-18 20:40   It is evident now that the General and the Council do resolve to make way for the King’s coming.

1660-04-18 20:20   The Lords do meet every day at my Lord of Manchester’s, and resolve to sit the first day of the Parliament.

1660-04-18 16:40   Dictating to Burr, who wrote above a dozen letters, by which I have made my mind more clear than I have had it yet since I came on board.

1660-04-18 11:00   Sir R. Stayner and as many of my Lord’s people as could be spared went to Dover to get things ready against to-morrow for the election.

1660-04-18 07:20   Mr. Edward Montagu on board, but what was the business of his coming and making no stay at all I cannot guess.

1660-04-17 22:55   So to sleep, every day bringing me a fresh sense of the pleasure of my present life.

1660-04-17 22:40   To bed, and shifting myself from top to toe, there being J. Goods and W. Howe sat late by my bedside talking.

1660-04-17 15:40   It was so clear that my Lord’s glass shewed us Calais very plain, and the cliffs were as plain to be seen as Kent.

1660-04-17 12:10   Getting ready commissions for the Vice-Admiral and the Rear-Admiral, wherein my Lord was careful to express the utmost of his own power.

1660-04-16 12:00   Giving out orders to the Commanders of the Fleet to discharge all supernumeraries that they had above the number that the Council had set.

1660-04-16 03:50   Mr. Cook waked me where I lay in the great cabin below, and I did give him his packet and directions for London. So to sleep again.

1660-04-15 18:20   I hear that since Lambert got out of the Tower, the Fanatiques had held up their heads high, but I hope all that will come to nothing.

1660-04-15 17:40   Mr. Cook came back from London with a packet which caused my Lord to be full of thoughts all day.

1660-04-15 13:00   My Lord told us that the University of Cambridge had a mind to choose him for their burgess, which he pleased himself with.

1660-04-15 07:10   Up early and was trimmed by the barber in the great cabin below.

1660-04-14 19:00   This day I heard that the Army had in general declared to stand by what the next Parliament shall do.

1660-04-14 16:40   My Lord had his freedom brought him by Captain Tiddiman of the port of Dover, by which he is capable of being elected for them.

1660-04-14 15:00   My Lord Lambert is got out of the Towers and there is 100l. proffered to whoever shall bring him forth to the Council of State.

1660-04-14 11:40   I saw our boat come with Mr. Pierce in it, who endeavouring to come on board us, had like to have been drowned had it not been for a rope.

1660-04-14 10:30   Drank a good morning draught with Mr. Sheply, which occasioned my thinking upon the happy life that I live now.

1660-04-14 09:50   What with the goodness of the bed and the rocking of the ship I slept till almost ten o’clock.

1660-04-14 01:50   It being very rainy, and the rain coming upon my bed, I went and lay with John Goods in the great cabin below.

1660-04-14 01:15   Writing letters to Mr. Downing about my business of continuing my office to myself, only Mr. Moore to execute it for me.

1660-04-13 17:00   I went up to the lieutenant’s cabin and there we broached a vessel of ale that we had sent for among us from Deal to-day.

1660-04-13 15:30   I set my own things in my cabin and chests in better order than hitherto, and set my papers in order.

1660-04-12 20:15   I sent a packet to London with several letters to my friends, as to my wife about my getting of money for her when she should need it.

1660-04-11 22:50   I staid the lieutenant late, shewing him my manner of keeping a journal. After that to bed.

1660-04-11 22:30   W. Howe and I at our viallins in my cabin, where Mr. Ibbott and the lieutenant were late.

1660-04-11 20:10   I am sensible that I have been a little too free to make mirth with the minister of our ship, he being a very sober and an upright man.

1660-04-11 19:40   My Lord confessed to me that he was not sure of his own Captain to be true to him, and that he did not like Captain Stokes.

1660-04-11 19:20   My Lord and I had a great deal of discourse about the Captains and his interest among them, and had his mind clear to bring in the King.

1660-04-11 17:15   All the news from London is that things go on further towards a King.

1660-04-11 16:30   Came a packet of letters from London directed to me, among the rest two from my wife, the first that I have since coming away from London.

1660-04-11 14:00   The wind was very high, so that a gentleman that was at dinner that came along with Sir John Bloys was forced to rise from table.

1660-04-10 20:50   As I was all alone in my cabin, in a melancholy fit playing on my viallin, my Lord and Sir R. Stayner came into the coach and supped there.

1660-04-10 13:35   Hither came the Vice-Admiral to us, and sat and talked and seemed a very good-natured man.

1660-04-10 13:20   This morning many or most of the commanders in the Fleet came on board and dined here.

1660-04-10 01:05   Balty took leave of me to go away to-morrow morning with Mr. Dickering. I lent Balty 15s. which he was to pay to my wife.

1660-04-09 21:10   This evening Mr. Sheply came on board, having escaped a very great danger upon a sand coming from Chatham.

1660-04-09 17:25   Great was the shout of guns from the castles and ships, and our answers, that I never heard yet so great rattling of guns.

1660-04-09 17:10   We came to the Goodwin, so to the Castles about Deal; where our Fleet lay, among whom we anchored.

1660-04-09 15:00   I first saw France and Calais, with which I was much pleased, though it was at a distance.

1660-04-09 14:40   We had a very fresh gale, which I brooked better than I thought I should be able to do.

1660-04-09 07:05   We having sailed all night, were come in sight of the North and South Forelands in the morning.

1660-04-08 21:00   We continued sailing when I went to bed, being somewhat ill again.

1660-04-08 20:15   Will Howe, the surgeon, parson, and Balty supped in the Lieutenant’s cabin and afterwards sat disputing extemporary prayers, very hot.

1660-04-08 16:40   We had a brave wind all the afternoon, and overtook two good merchantmen that overtook us yesterday, going to the East Indies.

1660-04-08 11:55   Set sail; in our way I see many vessels and masts, which are now the greatest guides for ships.

1660-04-07 17:15   This day Mr. Sheply went to Sheppy.

1660-04-07 17:00   Went to bed and got a caudle made me.

1660-04-07 16:40   After dinner, and all the afternoon I walked upon the deck to keep myself from being sick.

1660-04-07 12:00   My Lord sent for me down to eat some oysters, the best my Lord said that ever he ate in his life, though I have ate as good at Bardsey.

1660-04-07 09:10   The wind grew high, and we being among the sands lay at anchor; I began to be dizzy and squeamish.

1660-04-06 21:50   It being fine moonshine, I staid late walking upon the quarter-deck with Mr. Cuttance, learning of some sea terms.

1660-04-06 18:10   This afternoon I made even with my Lord to this day, and did give him all the money remaining in my hands.

1660-04-06 17:40   All the day with Balty walking and talking, we under sail as far as the Spitts.

1660-04-06 15:00   W. Howe and I to our viallins, the first time since we came on board.

1660-04-06 09:20   Came my brother-in-law Balty to see me, and to desire to be here with me as Reformado, which did much trouble me.

1660-04-05 20:50   Mr. Creed brought me 30l., which my Lord had ordered him to pay me upon account, and Captain Clerke brought me a noted caudle.

1660-04-05 18:30   Came in the evening to Lee roads and anchored.

1660-04-05 17:05   I spent all the afternoon upon the deck, it being very pleasant weather.

1660-04-05 12:15   We ready to set sail, which we did about noon.

1660-04-04 19:30   My Lord resolved to send the Captain of our ship to Waymouth and promote his being chosen there.

1660-04-04 17:10   The Commissioners came to-day, only to consult about a further reducement of the Fleet, and to pay them as fast as they can.

1660-04-04 13:05   I dined all alone to prevent company, which was exceeding great to-day, in my cabin.

1660-04-04 12:45   Mr. Blackburne told me that it was certain now that the King must of necessity come in.

1660-04-04 12:30   There come Colonel Thomson with the wooden leg, and General Pen, and dined with my Lord. 

1660-04-03 21:40   My heart exceeding heavy for not hearing of my dear wife and indeed I do not remember that ever my heart was so apprehensive of her absence.

1660-04-03 19:30   I took the Lieutenant of the Swiftsure, and Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, to my cabin, where we drank a bottle of wine.

1660-04-03 11:00   There come many merchants to get convoy to the Baltique, which a course was taken for.

1660-04-03 03:05   There was great knocking at my cabin, which with difficulty (so they say) waked me, but it was only for a packet, so went to my bed again.

1660-04-02 17:45   My cabin is but little, but very convenient, having one window to the sea and another to the deck, and a good bed.

1660-04-02 17:30   After dinner I went in one of the boats with my boy before my Lord, and made shift before night to get my cabin in pretty good order.

1660-04-02 11:15   Comes Mr. Ed. Pickering, like a coxcomb. He tells me that the King will come in, but that Monk did resolve to have the doing of it himself.

1660-04-02 08:45   Mr. Creed was troubled to hear that he could not go along with my Lord, for he had already got his things thither, thinking to stay there.

1660-04-02 08:20   Great concourse of commanders here this morning to take leave of my Lord upon his going into the Nazeby.

1660-04-01 22:20   I made a commission for Captain Wilgness, of the Bear, to-night, which got me 30s. So after writing a while I went to bed.

1660-04-01 16:30   Captain Guy come on board, who tells me that the King will come in, and the soldiers at Dunkirk do drink the King’s health in the streets.

1660-04-01 14:00   My Lord did give me a list of the ships that were to be set out. He hath made it his care to put by as much of the Anabaptists as he can.
