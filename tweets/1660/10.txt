1660-10-31 23:30   My wife has been so ill of late of her old pain that I have not known her this fortnight almost, which is a pain to me.

1660-10-31 23:13   This month I conclude with my mind very heavy for the greatness of my late expenses, insomuch that I do not think that I have above 150l.

1660-10-31 23:10   Sir W. Pen is to ride to Sir W. Batten’s house to-morrow, and would have me go with him, so I up late getting together my things to ride in.

1660-10-31 16:30   I hear that the Queen is landed at Dover, and will be here on November 2nd.

1660-10-31 12:05   I spoke of it to the Comptroller and the principal officers, who are all unwilling to meddle in anything that may anger my Lady Davis.

1660-10-31 11:50   Much troubled all this morning in my mind about the business of my walk on the leads.

1660-10-30 20:40   I am told Mr. Davis’s people have broken open the bolt of my chamber door that goes upon the leads, which did trouble me more and more.

1660-10-30 18:30   We did read over the King’s declaration in matters of religion, which is very well penned, I think to the satisfaction of most people.

1660-10-30 17:10   To ease my mind, I went to the Cockpit all alone, and there saw a very fine play called “The Tamer Tamed;” very well acted.

1660-10-29 20:20   I was told my Lady Davis is now come to our next lodgings, and has locked up the leads door from me, which puts me into a great disquiet.

1660-10-29 15:30   Went with my Lady Pickering to her lodging, a poor one in Blackfryars, where she never invited me to go in, which methought was strange.

1660-10-29 11:00   We had a good place to see the pageants which were many, and I believe good, for such kind of things, but in themselves but poor and absurd.

1660-10-29 08:10   I up early, it being my Lord Mayor’s day, and neglecting my office I went to the Wardrobe, where I met my Lady Sandwich and the children.

1660-10-28 15:40   To White Hall chappell. Mr. Hill did take us into the King’s closet and there we did stay all service-time which I did think a great honour.

1660-10-28 14:20   I dined with my Lady, and my young Lord, and Mr. Sidney, who was sent for from Twickenham to see my Lord Mayor’s show to-morrow.

1660-10-27 19:20   I called at Paul’s Churchyard and bought Alsted’s Encyclopaedia, which cost me 38s.

1660-10-27 18:30   I went by chance by my new Lord Mayor’s house (Sir Richard Browne), by Goldsmith’s Hall, which is now fitting, and indeed is a pretty house.

1660-10-27 18:10   In London and Westminster all this day paying of money and buying of things for my house.

1660-10-26 20:10   I bought a book of the Life of our Queen, which I read at home to my wife; but it was so sillily writ, that we did nothing but laugh at it.

1660-10-26 15:40   I saw the Duke de Soissons go with a very great deal of state: his own coach all red velvet covered with gold lace, and drawn by six barbes.

1660-10-26 14:10   My father is mightily pleased with my ordering of my house.

1660-10-26 13:50   My father and Dr. Thomas Pepys dined at my house, the last of whom I did almost fox with Margate ale.

1660-10-25 18:30   All day at home doing something in order to the fitting of my house.

1660-10-24 22:10   Home, where I found a box of Carpenter’s tools sent by my cozen, Tho. Pepys, which I had bespoke of him for to employ myself with sometimes.

1660-10-24 15:30   Mr. Greatorex did show me the lamp-glasses, which carry the light a great way, good to read in bed by, and I intend to have one of them.

1660-10-24 12:50   Capt. Murford did put 3l. into my hands for a friendship I had done him. I bade him keep it till he has enough to buy my wife a necklace.

1660-10-24 09:37   We were friends again as we are always.

1660-10-24 09:25   I took occasion to be angry with my wife about her putting up of half a crown in a paper box, which she had forgot where she had lain it.

1660-10-24 09:10   I lay and slept long to-day.

1660-10-23 20:50   I found Mr. Spong to be as ingenious a man as I met with in my life, and cannot admire him enough, he being so plain and illiterate a man.

1660-10-23 20:30   We looked over many instruments of Mr. Spong's, especially his wooden jack in his chimney, which goes with the smoke, which is very pretty.

1660-10-23 16:10   I took my Lord’s picture, and carried it to Mr. de Cretz to be copied.

1660-10-23 14:40   Petit having a design to reform the universities, and to institute schools for the learning of languages, which I know will come to nothing.

1660-10-23 14:10   Catan Stirpin told me that her mistress was lately dead of the small pox, and that herself was now married to Monsieur Petit.

1660-10-23 13:20   I took my brother Ashwell and his cozen Sam. Ashwell and Mr. Mallard to the Leg and gave them a dish of meat for dinner and paid for it.

1660-10-23 10:00   I met the judges riding on horseback to Westminster Hall, it being the first day of the term, the first time I ever saw any such solemnity.

1660-10-23 06:40   Mr. Sheply going to put up his pistols into the holsters, one of them flew off, and it pleased God that it did us no hurt.

1660-10-23 06:20   I went to bed with Mr. Sheply in his chamber, but could hardly get any sleep all night, the bed being ill made and he a bad bedfellow.

1660-10-22 21:10   I got leave to have my Lord's picture, that was done by Lilly, copied, and talking of religion, I found him to be a perfect Sceptic.

1660-10-22 14:30   To my Lord’s, where I found all preparing for my Lord’s going to sea to fetch the Queen tomorrow.

1660-10-21 22:10   This day or two my wife has been troubled with her boils in the old place, which do much trouble her.

1660-10-21 17:50   So home, where I found my boy, but he had found the way home well enough, of which I was glad.

1660-10-21 14:40   From the Crown to the Abbey to look for my boy, but he was gone thence, and so he being a novice I was at a loss what was become of him.

1660-10-21 14:15   George Vines carried me to his turret where there is Cooke’s head set up for a traytor and Harrison’s on the other side of Westminster Hall.

1660-10-21 14:00   We went to Price’s by the Hall back door, but there being no drink to be had we went away, and so to the Crown in the Palace Yard.

1660-10-20 15:45   A bloody week this and the last have been, there being ten hanged, drawn, and quartered.

1660-10-20 15:30   Calling at Crowe’s, in Saint Bartholomew’s, I saw the limbs of some of our new traitors set upon Aldersgate, which was a sad sight to see.

1660-10-20 14:10   I dined with my Lord and Lady; when he was very merry, and did talk very high how he would have a French cook, and a master of his horse.

1660-10-20 10:30   Going into my cellar I stepped into a heap of turds by which I found that Mr. Turner’s house of office is full and comes into my cellar.

1660-10-20 10:10   One came to me to advise with me where to make me a window into my cellar in lieu of one which Sir W. Batten had stopped up.

1660-10-19 23:40   I sat up late to make up my accounts for my Lord. I found him to be above 80l. in my debt, which is a good sight, and I bless God for it.

1660-10-19 12:50   This morning Hacker and Axtell were hanged and quartered, as the rest are.

1660-10-19 11:40   My dining-room was finished with green serge hanging and gilt leather, which is very handsome.

1660-10-18 16:32   Because my wife did not send the doves in the best cage, The. Turner sent them back again with a scornful letter, with which I was angry.

1660-10-18 16:20   I did find that The. Turner hath sent for a pair of doves that my wife had promised her.

1660-10-18 14:15   By her high discourse I found Mrs. Blackburne to be a very high dame and a costly one.

1660-10-18 14:00   To Mr. Blackburne, where I met my wife and my Will’s father and mother (the first time that ever I saw them), where we had a fine dinner.

1660-10-18 10:50   To my father’s, and did give orders for a pair of black baize linings to be made for my breeches against to-morrow morning, which was done.

1660-10-18 10:00   It being expected that Colonel Hacker and Axtell should die, I went to Newgate, but found they were reprieved till to-morrow.

1660-10-17 19:10   My wife and I went to put up my books in order in closet, and I to give her her books.

1660-10-17 16:30   Home again, where I finding Mrs. The. Turner and her aunt Duke I would not be seen but walked in the garden till they were gone.

1660-10-17 12:50   Their great design was to get me concerned in a business about a vessel of theirs, in which I promise to do them all the service I can.

1660-10-17 12:20   To the Feathers in Fish Street, where I was invited by Captain Cuttance to dinner, a dinner made by Mr. Dawes and his brother.

1660-10-16 18:00   My Lord seemed to be in a melancholy humour, which, I was told by W. Howe, was for that he had lately lost a great deal of money at cards.

1660-10-16 15:50   By the way reading of the other two stories that are in the book that I read last night, which I do not like so well as it.

1660-10-16 15:20   With Mr. Moore to the Cockpit, where, understanding that “Wit without money” was acted, I would not stay, but went home by water.

1660-10-16 01:00   To sleep, which I did not very well do, because my wife having a stopping in her nose she snored much, which I never did hear her do before.

1660-10-15 23:00   I read “The Fruitless Precaution” till I had made an end of it, and do find it the best writ tale that ever I read in my life.

1660-10-15 14:30   I met with Sir W. Batten and Pen, who made up a list of such ships as are fit to be kept out for the winter guard, the rest to be paid off.

1660-10-15 12:20   This morning Mr. Carew was hanged and quartered at Charing Cross; but his quarters, by a great favour, are not to be hanged up.

1660-10-14 21:10   We went home through the rain by water in a sculler, having borrowed some coats of Mr. Sheply.

1660-10-14 11:35   I observed, how the Duke of York and Mrs. Palmer did talk to one another very wantonly through the hangings.

1660-10-14 11:20   To White Hall chappell, where one Dr. Crofts made an indifferent sermon, and after it an anthem, ill sung, which made the King laugh.

1660-10-13 14:10   I was angry with my wife for her things lying about, and in my passion kicked the little fine basket, and broke it, which troubled me.

1660-10-13 13:20   To my Lord’s, and took Captain Cuttance and Mr. Sheply to the Sun Tavern, and did give them some oysters.

1660-10-13 10:50   It is said, that Maj.-gen. Harrison said that he was sure to come shortly at the right hand of Christ to judge them that now had judged him.

1660-10-13 10:35   Major-general Harrison was presently cut down, and his head and heart shown to the people, at which there was great shouts of joy.

1660-10-13 10:00   To Charing Cross, to see Major-general Harrison hanged, drawn, and quartered, he looking as cheerful as any man could do in that condition.

1660-10-12 19:45   My Lady Sandwich do give me good assurance of my uncle’s resolution to make me his heir.

1660-10-12 19:30   Found my Lady Sandwich at supper, so she made me sit down all alone with her, and after supper staid and talked with her.

1660-10-12 18:20   Mr. Cooke told me that my Lady Sandwich is come to town to-day, whereupon I went to Westminster to see her.

1660-10-12 13:50   With Sir W. Batten and the rest of the officers to a venison pasty of his at the Dolphin, where dined very noble company.

1660-10-11 18:10   We met with Mr. Salisbury, who took Mr. Creed and me to the Cockpitt to see “The Moore of Venice,” which was well done.

1660-10-11 15:36   I liked one round thing going within all with a pair of stairs round; round which being laid at an angle of 45 deg, do carry up the water.

1660-10-11 15:30   To walk in St. James’s Park, where we observed the several engines at work to draw up water, with which sight I was very much pleased.

1660-10-11 13:40   Mr. Creed and I to the Leg in King Street, to dinner, where he and I and my Will had a good udder to dinner.

1660-10-11 10:20   I met with Mr. Creed, and with him and Mr. Blackburne to the Rhenish wine house, where we sat drinking of healths a great while.

1660-10-10 16:00   In the afternoon with the upholster seeing him do things to my mind, and to my content he did fit my chamber and my wife’s.

1660-10-10 00:00   I found my wife in bed, and our chambers hung to-day by the upholster, but not being well done I was fretted, and so in a discontent to bed.

1660-10-09 12:50   About noon we dined together, and were very merry at table telling of tales.

1660-10-09 11:35   In our way had a great deal of merry discourse, and find Sir W. Pen to be a merry fellow and pretty good natured, and sings bawdy songs.

1660-10-09 11:20   With Sir W. Pen to Redriffe by water, and from thence walked over the fields to Deptford (the first pleasant walk I have had a great while).

1660-10-09 09:25   I saw in my Lord's chamber his picture, well done; and am with child till I get it copied out, which I hope to do when he is gone to sea.

1660-10-09 09:10   With Sir W. Pen to White Hall, where I went to my Lord, and found him in bed not well.

1660-10-08 20:50   Mr. Moore staid and supped with me till almost 9 at night. We love one another’s discourse so that we cannot part when we do meet.

1660-10-08 16:30   Calling at several places about business, at my father’s about gilded leather for my dining room, at Mr. Crew’s about money.

1660-10-07 15:45   A poor cold sermon of Dr. Lamb’s, in his habit, and so all ended, and by my troth a pitiful sorry devotion that these men pay.

1660-10-07 15:30   To the Abbey, where I heard them read the church-service, but very ridiculously, that indeed I do not in myself like it at all.

1660-10-07 11:20   I heard Dr. Spurstow preach before the King a poor dry sermon; but a very good anthem of Captn. Cooke’s afterwards.

1660-10-07 09:50   To White Hall on foot, calling at my father’s to change my long black cloak for a short one (long cloaks being now quite out).

1660-10-06 21:40   My Lord not coming in before 9 at night I staid no longer for him, but went back again home and so to bed.

1660-10-06 15:10   To Whitehall, where I was to give my Lord an account of the fleet in order to the choosing of a fleet fit for him to take to sea.

1660-10-06 14:20   Mr. Creed brought me some books from Holland, well bound books, which I thought he did intend to give me, but I found that I must pay him.

1660-10-06 10:10   Col. Slingsby and I at the office getting a catch ready for the Prince de Ligne to carry his things away, who is now going home again.

1660-10-05 18:45   I am in great joy to see my house likely once again to be clean.

1660-10-05 18:10   All the afternoon at home to see my painters make an end of their work, which they did to-day to my content.

1660-10-04 21:20   I met with Mr. Pierce and his wife, took them home and did give them good wine, ale, and anchovies, and staid them till night, and so adieu.

1660-10-04 15:50   Lieut. Lambert and I did look upon my Lord’s model, and he told me many things in a ship that I desired to understand.

1660-10-04 14:30   To my Lord’s, where we took Mr. Sheply and Wm. Howe to the Raindeer, and had some oysters, which were good, the first I have eat this year.

1660-10-04 12:12   Lord! at the Bishops’ going out, how people did most of them look upon them as strange creatures, and few with any kind of love or respect.

1660-10-04 12:00   I saw the Bishops of Winchester, Bangor, Rochester, Bath and Wells, and Salisbury, all in their habits, in King Henry Seventh’s chappell.

1660-10-04 11:30   I and Lieut. Lambert to Westminster Abbey, where we saw Dr. Frewen translated to the Archbishoprick of York.

1660-10-03 14:40   After dinner my Lord did discourse with me, and advise about some way to get himself some money to make up for all his great expenses.

1660-10-03 11:20   To my Lord’s, who sent a great iron chest to White Hall; I saw it carried into the King’s closet, where I saw most incomparable pictures.

1660-10-03 10:30   I heard the Duke speak of a great design that he has, of sending a venture to some parts of Africa to dig for gold ore there.

1660-10-03 10:10   To White Hall, where a meeting about the Winter Guard, but we determined of nothing.

1660-10-02 21:40   Home, where my wife tells me what she has bought to-day, namely, a bed and furniture for her chamber, with which very pleased I went to bed.

1660-10-02 20:10   To Major Hart, who is just going out of town to-morrow, and made much of me, and did give me the oaths of supremacy and allegiance.

1660-10-02 19:30   To my father’s, and discoursed with him about Tom, and did give my advice to take him home again, which I think he will do in prudence.

1660-10-02 18:20   At the Abbey I found a thin congregation. So I see that religion is but a humour, and so the esteem of it passeth as other things do.

1660-10-02 17:40   At Will’s I met with Mr. Spicer, and with him to the Abbey to see them at vespers.

1660-10-02 13:00   I took Captain Clerk to the Leg in King Street, and did give him a dish or two of meat, and his purser, for his old kindness to me on board.

1660-10-02 09:10   My brother Tom told me that for his lying out of doors a day and a night my father had forbade him to come any more into his house.

1660-10-01 20:30   My layings out upon my house in furniture are so great that I shall not be able to go through them without breaking one of my bags of 100l.

1660-10-01 18:20   The Commissioners are very busy disbanding of the army, which they say do cause great robbing.

1660-10-01 14:50   After dinner my father and I advised about hangings for my rooms, which are now almost fit to be hung, the painters beginning their work.

1660-10-01 08:00   Early to my Lord to Whitehall, and there he did give me some work to do for him, and so with all haste to the office.
