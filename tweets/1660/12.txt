1660-12-31 22:20   Home and to bed.

1660-12-31 21:20   There was a Frenchman with one eye that was going my way, so he and I hired the coach between us and he set me down in Fenchurch Street.

1660-12-31 20:50   My boy taking a cat home with him from my Lord’s, which Sarah had given him for my wife, we being much troubled with mice.

1660-12-31 18:00   I went to my Lord’s, where I found him private at cards with my Lord Lauderdale and some persons of honour.

1660-12-31 17:22   My expectation being too great the play did not please me as otherwise I believe it would; my having a book I believe did spoil it a little.

1660-12-31 17:10   In Paul’s Church-yard I bought the play of “Henry the Fourth,” and so went to the new Theatre and saw it acted.

1660-12-30 16:10   I to the Abby and walked there, seeing the great confusion of people that come there to hear the organs.

1660-12-30 15:20   Mr. Child and I spent some time at the lute, and so promising to prick me some lessons to my theorbo he went away to see Henry Laws.

1660-12-30 12:40   To my Lord’s. There I found Mr. Shepley, in his Venetian cap, taking physique in his chamber, and with him I sat till dinner.

1660-12-29 21:10   I home with my father, he telling me what bad wives both my cozen Joyces make to their husbands, which I much wondered at.

1660-12-29 13:20   To Sir W. Pen, who offering me a barrel of oysters I took them home to my house (having a good piece of roast beef at the fire for dinner).

1660-12-28 22:10   At my lute, with great pleasure, and so to bed with great content.

1660-12-28 12:10   Office day. There all the morning.

1660-12-28 07:20   I was pretty well, only got cold, and so had pain in pissing, as I used to have.

1660-12-28 03:10   I was very ill — I think with eating and drinking too much — and so I was forced to call the maid. I vomited in the bason, and so to sleep.

1660-12-27 15:00   With my wife to Sir W. Batten’s to dinner, where much and good company.

1660-12-27 10:40   I staid in the garden talking with my Lord, who do show me his love and do communicate his mind in things to me, which is my great content.

1660-12-26 14:20   At table, my Lady Sandwich did tell me how much fault was laid upon Dr. Frazer and the rest of the Doctors, for the death of the Princess!

1660-12-26 11:00   To the office (being soundly washed going through the bridge) to Sir Wm. Batten and Pen (the last of whom took physic to-day).

1660-12-26 00:00   I, before and after supper, to my lute and Fuller’s History, at which I staid all alone in my chamber, and so to bed.

1660-12-25 15:50   To church again, my wife and I, where we had a dull sermon of a stranger, which made me sleep.

1660-12-25 14:00   Home to dinner, where my wife and I and my brother Tom, to a good shoulder of mutton and a chicken.

1660-12-25 09:10   Very much pleased to see my house once more clear of workmen and to be clean, and indeed it is so, far better than it was.

1660-12-24 22:00   With the painters, making an end of my house and the arch before my door, and so this night I was rid of them and all other work.

1660-12-24 19:20   This day the Princess Royal died at Whitehall.

1660-12-23 14:00   I found my wife and maid had made shift to spit a great turkey, but not at all roasted, and so I was fain to stay till two o’clock.

1660-12-23 11:30   To Church, where our pew all covered with rosemary and baize. A stranger made a dull sermon.

1660-12-22 22:00   I home (found my house clear of the workmen and their work ended), my head troubled with wine, and I very merry went to bed.

1660-12-22 21:40   Sir W. Pen so overcome with wine that he could hardly go; I was forced to lead him through the streets and he was in a merry and kind mood.

1660-12-22 15:40   We had a very fine dinner, good musique, and a great deal of wine.

1660-12-22 12:10   To the Sun tavern, to a dinner of Captn. Teddimans, my Lord Inchiquin, Sir W. Pen, Captn. Cuttance, Mr. Lawrence, and other good company.

1660-12-22 11:50   All the morning with my painters, who will make an end of all this day I hope.

1660-12-21 20:10   My aunt at Brampton has voided a great stone and cannot possibly live long. My uncle is pretty well, but full of pain still.

1660-12-21 19:40   I walked through the dirt to Whitehall to see whether my Lord be come to town, and I found him come and at supper, and I supped with him.

1660-12-21 14:05   The Princess Royal hath married herself to young Jermyn, which is worse than the Duke of York’s marrying the Chancellor’s daughter.

1660-12-21 13:50   To my Lady’s, and dined with her: she told me how dangerously ill the Princess Royal is and that this morning she was said to be dead.

1660-12-20 19:00   All day at home with my workmen, that I may get all done before Christmas.

1660-12-20 14:20   I hear that the Princess Royal has the small pox.

1660-12-19 20:10   This night Mr. Gauden sent me a great chine of beef and half a dozen of tongues.

1660-12-19 15:50   At noon I went and dined with my Lady at Whitehall, and so back again to the office, and after that home to my workmen.

1660-12-18 19:30   All day at home, without stirring at all, looking after my workmen.

1660-12-17 20:20   This day my parlour is gilded, which do please me well.

1660-12-17 16:00   Both Sir Williams tell us that the Assurance is got up, without much damage to her body, only to the goods that she hath within her.

1660-12-16 20:40   Staid with my Lady talking of the Duke of York and his lady, the Chancellor’s daughter, between whom all is agreed and he will marry her.

1660-12-16 18:10   I learnt a pretty trick to try whether a woman be a maid or no, by a string going round her head to meet at the end of her nose.

1660-12-16 16:00   Beale took us into the Guard in Scotland Yard, and showed us Major-General Overton. I heard him deny that he is guilty of any such things.

1660-12-16 14:50   I was surprised with the news of a plot against the King’s person and my Lord Monk’s; there are about forty taken up on suspicion.

1660-12-15 18:40   We had three eels that my wife and I bought this morning of a man, that cried them about, for our dinner, and that was all I did to-day.

1660-12-14 20:20   To the Coffee House where we had very good discourse concerning insects and their having a generative faculty as well as other creatures.

1660-12-13 17:30   All the day long looking upon my workmen who this day began to paint my parlour.

1660-12-13 13:10   To my Lady Batten’s, where were Sir John Lawson and Captain Holmes. We dined and had very good red wine of my Lady’s own making in England.

1660-12-12 22:10   Home and to bed, reading myself asleep, while the wench sat mending my breeches by my bedside.

1660-12-12 20:10   To my Lady Batten, and sat an hour or two, and talked with her daughter and people in the absence of her father and mother and my wife.

1660-12-12 14:30   My father did offer me six pieces of gold, in lieu of six pounds that he borrowed of me, but it went against me to take it of him.

1660-12-11 16:50   Mr. Moore has persuaded me to put out 250l. for 50l. per annum for eight years, and I think I shall do it.

1660-12-11 16:30   Mr. Moore and I to a tavern near my house, and there we drank and discoursed of ways how to put out a little money to the best advantage.

1660-12-11 10:30   I did the first office of a justice of Peace to examine a seaman thereupon, but could find no reason to commit him.

1660-12-11 09:40   Captain Stoakes is very melancholy, and being in search for some clothes and money of his, which he says he hath lost out of his cabin.

1660-12-11 09:00   The Assurance lies there (poor ship, that I have been twice merry in) under water, only the upper deck may be seen and the masts.

1660-12-11 07:30   Though the weather was very bad and the wind high, yet my Lady Batten and her maid and we two did go by our barge to Woolwich.

1660-12-10 21:40   To ease my mind did cast up how my cash stands. I do find as near as I can that I am worth in money clear 240l., for which God be praised.

1660-12-10 20:50   Home and found my wife at my Lady Batten’s, and have made a bargain to go see the ship sunk at Woolwich.

1660-12-10 19:10   To the Coffee House in Cornhill, the first time I was there. I found much pleasure in it, through the diversity of company and discourse.

1660-12-10 15:34   Sir Chas. Barkley swearing that he and others had lain with the Lord Chancellor’s daughter often, which all believe to be a lie.

1660-12-10 15:22   The marriage is likely to be the ruin of Mr. Davis and my Lord Barkley, who have carried themselves so high against the Chancellor.

1660-12-10 15:10   It is expected that the Duke will marry the Lord Chancellor’s daughter at last.

1660-12-10 07:00   It being a very fine, bright, moonshine morning I walked twenty turns in Cornhill from Gracious Street corner to the Stockes and back again.

1660-12-09 19:10   So to my father’s, where I sat while they were at supper, and I found my mother below stairs and pretty well.

1660-12-09 17:40   Infinite of talk of all kind of things with my Lady, especially of beauty of men and women, with which she seems to be pleased to talk of.

1660-12-09 11:50   I went to chappell, and sat in Mr. Blagrave’s pew, and there did sing my part along with another before the King, and with much ease.

1660-12-09 06:40   Sir W. Batten told me the ill news from Woolwich, that the Assurance was by a gust of wind sunk down to the bottom. Twenty men drowned.

1660-12-08 21:40   I went to bed, having drunk so much wine that my head was troubled, and the wind, I observed, was rose exceedingly before I went to bed.

1660-12-08 15:30   We had a lovely chine of beef and other good things very complete and drank a great deal of wine and her daughter played upon the virginals.

1660-12-08 14:00   I went to dinner with my wife and Mr. and Mrs. Pierce the Surgeon to Mr. Pierce, the Purser who does live very plentifully and finely.

1660-12-08 11:10   I went along with Sir W. Pen by water to the office, and there with Mr. Huchinson we did find that we were in no mistake.

1660-12-08 10:00   Sir G. Carteret and Sir W. Pen were in a great fear that we had committed a great error of 100,000l in our account gone into the Parliament.

1660-12-08 00:00   I fell a-reading Fuller’s History of Abbys, and my wife in Great Cyrus till twelve at night, and so to bed.

1660-12-07 15:50   To the Privy Seal, where I signed a deadly number of pardons, which do trouble me to get nothing by.

1660-12-07 14:10   I dined with my Lady, there being Laud the page’s mother there, and seemed to have been a very pretty woman and of good discourse.

1660-12-06 23:15   I took occasion to go up and to bed in a pet.

1660-12-06 23:00   I found my girl knocking at the door, her mistress having sent her out for some trivial business, which did vex me when I came in.

1660-12-06 22:40   A waterman did tell how once he carried a lady from Putney, and she bade him lie down by her, which he did, and did give her content.

1660-12-06 20:40   One Mr. Pierce, an army man, did make us the best sport for songs and stories in a Scotch tone (which he do very well) that ever I heard.

1660-12-06 18:10   To Parliament Stairs, and there at an alehouse to Doling, Simond, Luellin, Mr. Mount and several others.

1660-12-06 16:30   My Lord tells me his mind as to his enlarging his family, &c., and desiring me to look him out a Master of the Horse and other servants.

1660-12-06 16:00   My Lord told me of his going to-morrow to settle the militia in Huntingdonshire, and did desire me to lay up a box of some rich jewels.

1660-12-06 13:20   Mr. Moore and I alone to the Leg in King Street, and dined together on a neat’s tongue and udder.

1660-12-05 19:20   I found my mother still ill of the stone, and had just newly voided one, which she had let drop into the chimney, and looked to shew it me.

1660-12-05 17:00   The humours of the country gentleman and the French doctor very well done, but the rest but very poorly, and Sir J. Falstaffe as bad as any.

1660-12-05 14:40   I dined at home, and after dinner I went to the new Theatre and there I saw “The Merry Wives of Windsor” acted.

1660-12-05 09:50   I wrote the proposal fair for Sir. G. Carteret to show to the King, and so it is to go to the Parliament.

1660-12-05 08:30   The Proposal which I wrote the last night I showed to the officers this morning, was well liked of.

1660-12-05 01:00   I did carry our design to Sir W. Batten, where I found some gentlemen with him playing at cards, and there I staid looking upon them.

1660-12-04 18:25   Which do trouble me that a man of so great courage as he was, should have that dishonour, though otherwise he might deserve it enough.

1660-12-04 18:10   The Parliament voted that Oliver, Ireton, Bradshaw, &c. should be taken up out of their graves, and drawn to the gallows, and there hanged.

1660-12-04 14:30   After dinner Sir Tho. and my Lady to the Playhouse to see “The Silent Woman.”

1660-12-04 11:20   This he do like, and we returned to Sir G. Carteret’s chamber, and we did draw up this design in order to be presented to the Parliament.

1660-12-04 11:05   We did open to the Duke our project of stopping the charge of the fleet by paying them in hand one moyety, and the other four months hence.

1660-12-04 09:40   To Whitehall to Sir G. Carteret’s chamber, where all the officers met, and so we went up to the Duke of York and he took us into his closet.

1660-12-03 23:00   I fell a reading ‘Cornelianum dolium’ till 11 o’clock at night with great pleasure, and after that to bed.

1660-12-03 18:35   They both found me under the barber’s hand; but I had a bottle of good sack in the house, and so made them very welcome.

1660-12-03 18:20   To the office till night, and so home, and then come Mr. Davis, of Deptford, and Mons. L’Impertinent, who is to go to Ireland to-morrow.

1660-12-03 13:50   After office home to dinner, where come in my cozen Snow by chance, and I had a very good capon to dinner.

1660-12-03 06:00   This morning I took a resolution to rise early in the morning, and so I rose by candle, which I have not done all this winter.

1660-12-02 22:40   After sermon took Tom Fuller’s Church History and read over Henry the 8th’s life in it, and so to supper and to bed.

1660-12-02 13:30   My wife and I to a leg of mutton, the sawce of which being made sweet, I was angry at it, and eat none, but only dined upon the marrow bone.

1660-12-02 08:00   My head not very well, and my body out of order by last night’s drinking, which is my great folly.

1660-12-01 22:40   After a pint of wine I went home, my brains somewhat troubled with so much wine, and after a letter or two by the post I went to bed.

1660-12-01 18:20   So to Paul’s Churchyard, and there I took the little man at Mr. Kirton’s and Mr. Shepley to Ringstead’s at the Star.

1660-12-01 16:30   They tell us how a Scotch knight was killed basely at the Fleece in Covent Garden, where there had been a great many formerly killed.

1660-12-01 15:10   Mr. Pinkney took us to the tavern, and gave us a pint of wine, and there fell into our company old Mr. Flower and another gentleman.

1660-12-01 11:50   To my Lord’s, and did give up my audit of his accounts, which I had been then two days about, and was well received by my Lord.

1660-12-01 11:20   I went to my Lord St. Albans lodgings, and found him in bed, talking to a priest that leaned along over the side of the bed.

1660-12-01 09:10   Observing some things to be laid up not as they should be by the girl, I took a broom and basted her till she cried extremely.
