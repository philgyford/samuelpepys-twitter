1660-12-31 17:22 My expectation being too great the play did not please me as otherwise I believe it would; my having a book I believe did spoil it a little.

1660-12-21 14:05 The Princess Royal hath married herself to young Jermyn, which is worse than the Duke of York’s marrying the Chancellor’s daughter.

1660-12-21 13:50 To my Lady’s, and dined with her: she told me how dangerously ill the Princess Royal is and that this morning she was said to be dead.

1660-12-16 14:50 I was surprised with the news of a plot against the King’s person and my Lord Monk’s; there are about forty taken up on suspicion.

1660-12-15 18:40 We had three eels that my wife and I bought this morning of a man, that cried them about, for our dinner, and that was all I did to-day.

1660-12-14 20:20 To the Coffee House where we had very good discourse concerning insects and their having a generative faculty as well as other creatures.

1660-12-10 19:10 To the Coffee House in Cornhill, the first time I was there. I found much pleasure in it, through the diversity of company and discourse.

1660-12-10 15:34 Sir Chas. Barkley swearing that he and others had lain with the Lord Chancellor’s daughter often, which all believe to be a lie.

1660-12-10 15:22 The marriage is likely to be the ruin of Mr. Davis and my Lord Barkley, who have carried themselves so high against the Chancellor.

1660-12-10 15:10 It is expected that the Duke will marry the Lord Chancellor’s daughter at last.

1660-12-10 07:00 It being a very fine, bright, moonshine morning I walked twenty turns in Cornhill from Gracious Street corner to the Stockes and back again.

1660-12-05 08:30 The Proposal which I wrote the last night I showed to the officers this morning, was well liked of.

1660-12-05 01:00 I did carry our design to Sir W. Batten, where I found some gentlemen with him playing at cards, and there I staid looking upon them.

1660-12-04 18:25 Which do trouble me that a man of so great courage as he was, should have that dishonour, though otherwise he might deserve it enough.

1660-12-04 18:10 The Parliament voted that Oliver, Ireton, Bradshaw, &c. should be taken up out of their graves, and drawn to the gallows, and there hanged.

1660-12-03 06:00 This morning I took a resolution to rise early in the morning, and so I rose by candle, which I have not done all this winter.

1660-12-02 22:40 After sermon took Tom Fuller’s Church History and read over Henry the 8th’s life in it, and so to supper and to bed.

1660-12-02 13:30 My wife and I to a leg of mutton, the sawce of which being made sweet, I was angry at it, and eat none, but only dined upon the marrow bone.

1660-12-02 08:00 My head not very well, and my body out of order by last night’s drinking, which is my great folly.

1660-12-01 22:40 After a pint of wine I went home, my brains somewhat troubled with so much wine, and after a letter or two by the post I went to bed.
