1660-08-31 22:40   Blessed be God all things continue well with and for me. I pray God fit me for a change of my fortune.

1660-08-31 16:30   I agreed to let my house quite out of my hands to Mr. Dalton for 41l.

1660-08-31 14:20   To my Lord again, who told me that he is ordered to go suddenly to sea, and did give me some orders to be drawing up against his going.

1660-08-30 15:30   This the first day that ever I saw my wife wear black patches since we were married!

1660-08-30 15:10   My wife went to Mr. Pierce’s wife’s child’s christening, and was urged to be godmother, but I advised her before-hand not to do it.

1660-08-30 13:50   At Westminster Hall I met with Mr. Paget the lawyer, and dined with him at Heaven.

1660-08-30 11:40   To White Hall, where I met with the Act of Indemnity (so long talked of), with the Act of Rate for Pole-money, and for judicial proceedings.

1660-08-30 07:50   We found all well below stairs, but the boy in a plight of seeming sorrow; but he is the most cunning rogue that ever I met with of his age.

1660-08-29 23:32   But the wench went down and got a candle lighted, and finding the boy in bed, and locking the doors fast, we slept well.

1660-08-29 23:21   The noise was the boy, we did believe, got in a desperate mood out of his bed to do himself or William some mischief.

1660-08-29 23:10   After we were all a-bed, the wench called us to listen of a sudden, which put my wife into such a fright that she shook every joint of her.

1660-08-29 20:50   Home, and find that my wife had found out more of the boy’s stealing 6s., and hid it in the house of office, at which my heart was troubled.

1660-08-29 20:20   I sent for my boy’s father and had his promise that if I will send home his boy, he will take him notwithstanding his indenture.

1660-08-29 12:30   I found my wife had discovered my boy Will’s theft and a great deal more than we imagined, at which I was vexed and intend to put him away.

1660-08-29 11:10   To the Church, where we took another view of the place where we had resolved to build a gallery, and have set men about doing it.

1660-08-29 08:50   My wife and I examined my boy Will about his stealing of things, but he denied all with the greatest subtlety and confidence in the world.

1660-08-28 22:15   I fear my boy Will is a thief and has stole some money of mine, particularly a letter that Mr. Jenkins did leave the last week.

1660-08-28 21:30   This day I heard my poor mother had then two days been very ill, and I fear she will not last long.

1660-08-28 20:40   I carried home 80l. from the Privy Seal, by coach, and at night spent a little more time with my wife about her music with great content.

1660-08-28 14:00   At home looking over my papers and books and house as to the fitting of it to my mind.

1660-08-28 10:50   Some time I spent this morning beginning to teach my wife some scale in music, and found her apt beyond imagination.

1660-08-28 06:50   I did receive Major Hart with wine and anchovies, which made me so dry that I was ill with them all night.

1660-08-27 11:36   I did give Ely half a crown because I saw that he was ready to cry to see that he could not be entertained by me here.

1660-08-27 11:25   These things came up to-day in our smack, and my boy Ely came along with them, and came after office was done to see me.

1660-08-27 11:05   Comes another with a brave Turkey carpet and a jar of olives from Captain Cuttance, and a pair of turtle-doves from John Burr to my wife.

1660-08-27 10:50   Comes one with a vessel of Northdown ale from Mr. Pierce, the purser, to me.

1660-08-26 22:50   In the garden and on the leads at night, and so to supper and to bed.

1660-08-26 11:40   With Sir W. Pen to the church, where we are placed in the highest pew of all, where a stranger preached a dry and tedious long sermon.

1660-08-25 22:40   This night W. Hewer brought me home from Mr. Pim’s my velvet coat and cap, the first that ever I had. So to bed.

1660-08-25 19:20   To Westminster Hall for a new half-shirt of Mrs. Lane, and so home by water.

1660-08-25 14:20   There coming to us Mr. Fowler the apothecary (the judge’s son) with a book of lute lessons which his father had left there for me.

1660-08-25 13:50   I took Mr. Turner and Mr. Moore to the Leg, and did give them a dinner, and then to the Sun Tavern, and did give Mr. Turner a glass of wine.

1660-08-25 10:20   Mr. Turner and I by coach from to Whitehall to Sir G. Carteret, where we there made up an estimate of the debts of the Navy for the Council.

1660-08-24 22:30   Into Paul’s Churchyard and bought Barkley’s Argenis in Latin, and so home and to bed.

1660-08-24 21:45   I found Dr. T. Pepys a weak man, and speaks the worst French that ever I heard of one that had been so long beyond sea.

1660-08-24 21:30   My father came in, and Dr. T. Pepys, who talked with me in French about looking out for a place for him.

1660-08-24 20:50   By land to my father’s, where I found my mother not very well. I did give her a pint of sack.

1660-08-24 12:40   With them to dinner at a tavern in Thames Street, where they were invited to a roasted haunch of venison and other very good victuals.

1660-08-24 11:30   With Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen to the church to find out a place where to build a gallery, and did find one which is to be done speedily.

1660-08-23 17:50   I met with W. Symons, T. Doling, and Mr. Booth, and with them to the Dogg, where we eat a musk melon, and were very merry.

1660-08-23 14:00   To Westminster Hall, where I met with my father Bowyer, and Mr. Spicer, and them I took to the Leg, and did give them a dish or two of meat.

1660-08-23 08:10   By water to Doctors’ Commons to Dr. Walker, to give him my Lord’s papers to view over concerning his being empowered to be Vice-Admiral.

1660-08-22 16:40   Mr. G. Montagu told me how there was like to be many factions between Marquis Ormond, General Monk, and the Lord Roberts, about Ireland.

1660-08-22 14:10   Mr. Hater and I to the office about doing something more as to the debts of the Navy than I had done yesterday.

1660-08-21 20:45   Gen. Monk is made Lieutenant of Ireland, which my Lord Roberts (made Deputy) do not like of, to be Deputy to any man but the King himself.

1660-08-21 20:30   It being post-night, I wrote to my Lord to give him notice that all things are well.

1660-08-21 15:40   I called on Mr. Pim, and found my velvet coat (the first that ever I had) done, and a velvet mantle, which I took to the Privy Seal Office.

1660-08-21 14:20   I to Westminster Hall, where there dined one Mr. Hickeman, an Oxford man, who spoke very much against the height of the now old clergy.

1660-08-20 22:50   Many of my things are quite spoilt with mould by reason of lying so long a shipboard, and my cabin being not tight.

1660-08-20 22:10   I went home, where I found all my things come home from sea (sent by desire by Mr. Dun), of which I was glad.

1660-08-20 20:55   Saw my Lord Chancellor come into his Great Hall, where wonderful how much company there was to expect him at a Seal.

1660-08-20 20:40   With W. Hewer by coach to Worcester House, where I light, sending him home with the 100l. that I received to-day.

1660-08-20 19:20   I went all alone to drink at Mr. Harper’s, where I found Mrs. Crisp’s daughter, with whom and her friends I staid and drank.

1660-08-20 12:00   I went to the House of Lords, and there staid all the morning, seeing their manner of sitting on woolpacks, &c., which I never did before.

1660-08-19 22:10   My wife and I went and walked in the garden, and so home to bed.

1660-08-19 16:40   I went up to put my papers in order, and finding my wife’s clothes lie carelessly laid up, I was angry with her, which I was troubled for.

1660-08-19 14:30   After dinner my wife went and fetched the little puppies to us, which are very pretty ones.

1660-08-19 13:45   The lace being of a light colour, and the lace all silver, my wife's new petticoat makes no great show.

1660-08-19 13:30   My wife had on her new petticoat that she bought yesterday, which indeed is a very fine cloth and a fine lace.

1660-08-19 11:20   Sir W. Batten, Pen, and myself, went to church to demand a pew, which could not be given us, but we are resolved to have one built.

1660-08-19 07:50   My wife tells me that the bitch has whelped four young ones and is well after it, my wife having had a fear that she would die thereof.

1660-08-18 22:40   Home by coach, and after being trimmed, leaving my wife to look after her little bitch, which was just now a-whelping, I to bed.

1660-08-18 17:50   After the play done, we three went to drink, and by Captain Ferrers’ means, Kinaston and another that acted Archas, came and drank with us.

1660-08-18 16:40   One Kinaston, a boy, acted the Duke’s sister, but made the loveliest lady that ever I saw in my life, only her voice not very good.

1660-08-18 15:20   Capt. Ferrers took me and Creed to the Cockpitt play, the first that I have had time to see since my coming from sea, “The Loyall Subject”.

1660-08-18 10:20   My father has persuaded my wife to buy a most fine cloth of 26s. a yard, and a rich lace, at which I was troubled, but I could not be angry.

1660-08-18 09:30   I took my wife towards Westminster by water, and landed her at Whitefriars, with 5l. to buy her a petticoat.

1660-08-17 21:20   This night I saw Mr. Creed show many the strangest evasions to shift off his drink I ever saw in my life.

1660-08-17 20:30   To Mr. Pim, the tailor’s, who took us to the Half Moon, and there did give us great store of wine and anchovies, and would pay for them all.

1660-08-17 13:50   Home to dinner where Mr. Unthanke, my wife’s tailor, dined with us, we having nothing but a dish of sheep’s trotters.

1660-08-16 14:30   Mr. Madge took me with him and Capt. Cooke and other masters of music to an ordinary at Charing Cross where we dined, all paying their club.

1660-08-16 07:25   My Lord speaking that it was not the salary of any place that did make a man rich, but the opportunity of getting money while in the place.

1660-08-16 07:10   My Lord (all things being ready) carried me by coach to Mr. Crew’s, where he took leave, and went into the coach, and so for Hinchinbroke.

1660-08-15 21:20   To my Lord’s, and he did give me direction about his business in his absence, he intending to go into the country to-morrow morning.

1660-08-15 20:30   To Westminster Hall, where I staid at Mrs. Michell’s, and with her and her husband sent for some drink, and drank with them.

1660-08-15 14:25   The King do tire all his people that are about him with early rising since he came.

1660-08-15 14:10   To White Hall, where I found the King gone this morning by 5 of the clock to see a Dutch pleasure-boat below bridge, where he dines.

1660-08-14 22:10   Home with my wife by water, where I made good sport with having the girl and the boy to comb my head, before I went to bed, in the kitchen.

1660-08-14 15:00   Captain Cuttance of the Speedwell brought me a firkin of butter for my wife, which is very welcome.

1660-08-14 14:45   I did also make even with Mr. Fairbrother for my degree of Master of Arts, which cost me about 9l. 16s.

1660-08-14 14:30   My father, after dinner, takes leave, after I had given him 40s. for the last half year for my brother John at Cambridge.

1660-08-14 13:40   Home by water to the Tower, where my father, Mr. Fairbrother, and Cooke dined with me.

1660-08-14 10:20   To the Privy Seal, and thence to my Lord’s, where Mr. Pim, the tailor, and I agreed upon making me a velvet coat.

1660-08-13 21:50   Home by coach, and took my 100l. that I had formerly left at Mr. Rawlinson’s, which is the first that ever I was master of at once.

1660-08-13 21:10   I to my Lord’s; where he told me that he would suddenly go into the country, and so did commend the business of his sea commission to me.

1660-08-13 20:30   My father and Creed and I to the old Rhenish Winehouse, and talked and drank till night.

1660-08-13 09:10   A sitting day at our office.

1660-08-12 17:40   I took Mrs. Lane to my house, where I was exceeding free in dallying with her, and she not unfree to take it.

1660-08-12 16:00   Meeting Mrs. Lane of Westminster Hall, I took her to my Lord’s, and did give her a bottle of wine in the garden.

1660-08-12 11:50   After sermon a brave anthem of Captain Cooke’s, which he himself sung, and the King was well pleased with it.

1660-08-12 11:30   To White Hall Chappell, where Mr. Calamy preached, and made a good sermon upon these words “To whom much is given, of him much is required.”

1660-08-11 22:35   W. Hewer did give me a good reason for his being out; but I thought it a good occasion to let him know that I do expect his being at home.

1660-08-11 22:20   I was vexed that W. Hewer was out of doors till ten at night but was satisfied again when my wife told me that he wept because I was angry.

1660-08-11 20:20   Home, and then sent for the barber, and was trimmed in the kitchen, the first time that ever I was so.

1660-08-11 07:00   I rose to-day without any pain, which makes me think that my pain yesterday was nothing but from my drinking too much the day before.

1660-08-10 20:45   Never since I was a man in the world was I ever so great a stranger to public affairs as now I am.

1660-08-10 20:30   For this month or two it is not imaginable how busy my head has been.

1660-08-10 18:00   I to my Lord’s, and went home, taking my lute with me. It had been all this while since I came from sea at my Lord’s for him to play on.

1660-08-10 16:45   Crow beat the other by above two miles.

1660-08-10 16:30   To Hide Park, and saw a fine foot-race three times round the Park between an Irishman and Crow, that was once my Lord Claypoole’s footman.

1660-08-10 14:40   I went and dined at home, and after dinner with great pain in my back I went by water to Whitehall to the Privy Seal.

1660-08-10 07:30   I rose with much pain and to the office.

1660-08-10 06:10   I had a great deal of pain all night, and a great loosing upon me so that I could not sleep.

1660-08-09 21:30   I, having my head full of drink from having drunk so much Rhenish wine in the morning, and more in the afternoon, came home and so to bed.

1660-08-09 18:10   To Mrs. Blackburne, who did treat my wife and me with a great deal of civility, and did give us a fine collation of collar of beef, &c.

1660-08-09 14:20   To my office of Privy Seal, and, having signed some things, to the Leg in King Street, and, sending for my wife, we dined there very merry.

1660-08-09 10:00   We were very merry, and judge Advocate did give Captain Hayward his Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy.

1660-08-09 09:10   To the Rhenish Wine-house, and Captain Hayward of the Plymouth, who is ordered to carry my Lord Winchelsea, Embassador to Constantinople.

1660-08-09 07:00   We lay there all night very pleasantly, I taking my pleasure with my wife in the morning, the first time after her being eased of her pain.

1660-08-08 22:30   My wife and I went to Mrs. Hunt’s, who would needs have us to lie at her house, and would not let us go home to-night.

1660-08-08 16:25   Coll. Dillon there, a very merry and witty companion, but methinks they live in a gaudy but very poor condition.

1660-08-08 16:10   To Mr. Butler’s to see his daughters, the first time that ever we made a visit to them. We found them very pretty.

1660-08-08 00:00   Found my wife pretty well again, and so to bed.

1660-08-07 20:10   Sam. Hartlibb staying long I left the coach and walked back again before on foot (a very pleasant walk) to Kensington, where I drank.

1660-08-07 18:40   Sam. Hartlibb, took me by coach to Kensington, to my Lord of Holland’s; I staid in the coach while he went in about his business.

1660-08-07 13:30   Come Sam. Hartlibb and his brother-in-law, to request my promise of a ship for them to Holland, which I had promised to get for them.

1660-08-06 23:15   Mr. Man offered me 1000l. for my office of Clerk of the Acts, which made my mouth water; but I dare not take it till I speak with my Lord.

1660-08-06 23:00   To Whitehall at the Privy Seal all the afternoon, and at night with Mr. Man to Mr. Rawlinson’s in Fenchurch Street.

1660-08-06 13:40   Home to dinner all alone, my wife being ill in pain a-bed, which I was troubled at, and not a little impatient.

1660-08-05 20:50   I got a Gravesend boat, that was come up to fetch some bread, and got them to carry me to the bridge, and so home, where I found my wife.

1660-08-05 20:00   To Westminster stairs, where I saw a fray between Mynheer Clinke, a Dutchman, and a waterman, which made good sport.

1660-08-05 18:20   To see W. Howe at Mr. Pierces, where I staid singing of songs and psalms an hour or two, and were very pleasant with Mrs. Pierce and him.

1660-08-05 15:30   After dinner to St. Margaret’s, where the first time I ever heard Common Prayer in that Church.

1660-08-05 10:10   My wife being much in pain, I went to Dr. Williams, in Holborn, and he did give me an ointment which I sent home by my boy, and a plaister.

1660-08-04 22:20   To bed, having not time to write letters, and indeed having so many to write to all places that I have no heart to go about them.

1660-08-04 22:00   Mrs. Shaw did die yesterday and her husband so sick that he is not like to live.

1660-08-04 21:30   I found my wife still in pain.

1660-08-04 20:50   It being very rainy, and it thundering and lightning exceedingly, I took coach, taking Monsieur L’Impertinent as far as the Savoy.

1660-08-04 18:20   I went and bespoke some linen of Betty Lane in the Hall, and after that to the Trumpet, where I sat and talked with her, &c.

1660-08-04 14:30   So to a Committee of Parliament (Sir Hen. Finch, Chairman), to give them an answer to an order of theirs.

1660-08-03 14:00   Dr. Clerke’s to dinner: I was taken with his lady, a comely, proper woman, though not handsome; a woman of the best language I ever heard.

1660-08-03 10:45   Up betimes, and after the barber had done with me, then to the office, where I and Sir William Pen only did meet and despatch business.

1660-08-02 19:00   When I came home I found my wife not very well of her old pain in the lip of her chose, which she had when we were married first.

1660-08-02 18:40   With my money home by coach.

1660-08-02 18:10   My heart rejoiced for God’s blessing to me, to give me this advantage by chance, there being of this 40l. about 10l. due to me.

1660-08-02 17:50   To the office of Privy Seal, where I stayed all the afternoon, and received about 40l. for yesterday and to-day.

1660-08-02 13:40   Dined with Mr. Blackburne at his house with his friends, where we were very well treated and merry.

1660-08-01 21:20   Bought a Lobster, and met with Winter and Mr. Delabarr, and there with a piece of sturgeon of theirs we went to the Sun Tavern and ate them.

1660-08-01 19:45   After I had signed all, I went with Dick Scobell and Luellin to drink at a bottle beer house in the Strand.

1660-08-01 12:50   Mr. Harper did advise me to act myself at the Privy Seal, but I told him I could not, because I had other business to take up my time.

1660-08-01 12:00   I took Mr. Harper to the Leg in King Street, and did give him his dinner.

1660-08-01 06:10   Up very early, and by water to Whitehall to my Lord’s, and there to my Lord’s lodging (Wm. Howe being now ill of the gout at Mr. Pierce’s).
