1660-08-31 14:20 To my Lord again, who told me that he is ordered to go suddenly to sea, and did give me some orders to be drawing up against his going.

1660-08-30 15:30 This the first day that ever I saw my wife wear black patches since we were married!

1660-08-30 15:10 My wife went to Mr. Pierce’s wife’s child’s christening, and was urged to be godmother, but I advised her before-hand not to do it.

1660-08-30 13:50 At Westminster Hall I met with Mr. Paget the lawyer, and dined with him at Heaven. 

1660-08-30 11:40 To White Hall, where I met with the Act of Indemnity (so long talked of), with the Act of Rate for Pole-money, and for judicial proceedings.

1660-08-30 07:50 We found all well below stairs, but the boy in a plight of seeming sorrow; but he is the most cunning rogue that ever I met with of his age.

1660-08-29 23:32 But the wench went down and got a candle lighted, and finding the boy in bed, and locking the doors fast, we slept well.

1660-08-29 23:21 The noise was the boy, we did believe, got in a desperate mood out of his bed to do himself or William some mischief.

1660-08-29 23:10 After we were all a-bed, the wench called us to listen of a sudden, which put my wife into such a fright that she shook every joint of her.

1660-08-29 20:50 Home, and find that my wife had found out more of the boy’s stealing 6s., and hid it in the house of office, at which my heart was troubled.

1660-08-29 12:30 I found my wife had discovered my boy Will’s theft and a great deal more than we imagined, at which I was vexed and intend to put him away.

1660-08-28 22:15 I fear my boy Will is a thief and has stole some money of mine, particularly a letter that Mr. Jenkins did leave the last week.

1660-08-28 21:30 This day I heard my poor mother had then two days been very ill, and I fear she will not last long.

1660-08-28 20:40 I carried home 80l. from the Privy Seal, by coach, and at night spent a little more time with my wife about her music with great content.

1660-08-19 16:40 I went up to put my papers in order, and finding my wife’s clothes lie carelessly laid up, I was angry with her, which I was troubled for.

1660-08-19 14:30 After dinner my wife went and fetched the little puppies to us, which are very pretty ones.

1660-08-19 13:45 The lace being of a light colour, and the lace all silver, my wife's new petticoat makes no great show.

1660-08-11 22:35 W. Hewer did give me a good reason for his being out; but I thought it a good occasion to let him know that I do expect his being at home.

1660-08-11 22:20 I was vexed that W. Hewer was out of doors till ten at night but was satisfied again when my wife told me that he wept because I was angry.

1660-08-11 20:20 Home, and then sent for the barber, and was trimmed in the kitchen, the first time that ever I was so.

1660-08-11 07:00 I rose to-day without any pain, which makes me think that my pain yesterday was nothing but from my drinking too much the day before.

1660-08-10 20:45 Never since I was a man in the world was I ever so great a stranger to public affairs as now I am.

1660-08-07 18:40 Sam. Hartlibb, took me by coach to Kensington, to my Lord of Holland’s; I staid in the coach while he went in about his business.

1660-08-07 13:30 Come Sam. Hartlibb and his brother-in-law, to request my promise of a ship for them to Holland, which I had promised to get for them.

1660-08-06 23:15 Mr. Man offered me 1000l. for my office of Clerk of the Acts, which made my mouth water; but I dare not take it till I speak with my Lord.

1660-08-06 23:00 To Whitehall at the Privy Seal all the afternoon, and at night with Mr. Man to Mr. Rawlinson’s in Fenchurch Street.
