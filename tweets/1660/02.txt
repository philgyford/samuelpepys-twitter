1660-02-16 19:10 By having but 3d. in my pocket made shift to spend no more, whereas if I had had more I had spent more. It is an advantage to carry little.

1660-02-11 23:05 At one end of the street you would think there was a whole lane of fire, so hot we were fain to keep on the further side merely for heat.

1660-02-11 22:45 The butchers at the May Pole in the Strand rang a peal with their knives when they were going to sacrifice their rump.

1660-02-11 22:05 In Cheapside there was a great many bonfires, and Bow bells and all the bells in all the churches as we went home were a-ringing.

1660-02-11 20:30 I saw many people give the soldiers drink and money, and all along in the streets cried, “God bless them!” and extraordinary good words. 

1660-02-11 18:50 Many in the House press for new oaths to be put upon men; whereas we have cause to be sorry for the oaths we have already taken and broken.

1660-02-11 14:45 We took coach to Guildhall, where the Hall was full of people expecting Monk and Lord Mayor to come thither, and all very joyfull.

1660-02-10 18:45 I went into London to Mr. Fage about the cancer in my mouth, which begins to grow dangerous, who gave me something for it.

1660-02-10 17:40 I went home, vexed about this business.

1660-02-10 17:10 Squib proved clearly by his patent that the house and office did belong to him. Our lawyer made some kind of opposition, but to no purpose.

1660-02-10 16:30 To the Exchequer, where I heard all the afternoon a great many causes before the Barons.

1660-02-10 11:15 I got money of Mr. Hawly to pay the lawyer and found Mr. Lenard, one of the Clerks, and took him to the Swan and gave him his morning draft.

1660-02-10 10:00 To the Exchequer, and there I made affidavit that Mr. Downing was gone into Holland by order of the Council of State.

1660-02-09 20:50 I went home and got some ahlum to my mouth, where I have the beginnings of a cancer, and had also a plaster to my boil underneath my chin.

1660-02-09 11:20 Monk is gone to secure some of the Common-council of the City, who did vote that they would not pay any taxes till the House was filled up.

1660-02-09 06:45 I heard the soldiers very busy, getting their horses ready where they lay at Hilton’s, but I knew not their meaning in so doing.

1660-02-08 22:15 Went to bed with my head not well by my too much drinking to-day, and I had a boil under my chin which troubled me cruelly.

1660-02-08 21:05 I went away homewards, and in Fleet Street, received a great jostle from a man that had a mind to take the wall, which I could not help.

1660-02-08 17:45 My father shewed me a base angry letter that he had received from my uncle Robert about my brother John, at which my father was very sad.

1660-02-08 15:10 Sending a porter with the bottles to the Temple I called upon Mrs. Jem, who was frighted till I came to tell her that her mother was well.

1660-02-07 20:50 Boys do now cry “Kiss my Parliament, instead of “Kiss my arse,” so great a contempt is the Rump come to among all the good and bad.

1660-02-07 20:10 A picture at the Exchange of a pair of buttocks shooting of a turd into Lawson’s mouth, and over it was wrote “The thanks of the house.”

1660-02-07 19:00 My Lord St. John is for a free Parliament, and he is very great with Monk, who hath now the absolute command and power to do any thing.

1660-02-07 15:10 I found a letter from my Lord in character, which I construed. I advised with Mr. Crew about it, it concerning my Lord’s coming up to Town.

1660-02-07 14:30 I saw Monk’s soldiers abuse all the Quakers, that were at a meeting-place, and indeed the soldiers did use them roughly and were to blame.

1660-02-07 11:10 To Paul's School, where he that made the speech did show a book which Mr. Crumlum had lately got, which is of the Founder’s own writing.

1660-02-06 22:20 I went to Will’s, where I staid at cards till 10 o’clock, losing half a crown, and so home to bed.

1660-02-06 16:30 To Mrs. Ann, and she and I had a very high bout, I rattled her up, she being in her bed, but she becoming more cool, we parted good friends.

1660-02-06 09:30 To Westminster, where we found the soldiers all set in the Palace Yard, to make way for General Monk to come to the House.

1660-02-05 20:40 A drum came by, beating of a strange manner of beat, which my wife and I wondered at, what the meaning of it should be.

1660-02-05 16:15 In Mrs. Turner’s pew my wife took up a good black hood and kept it. A stranger preached a poor sermon.

1660-02-05 12:00 After sermon I could not find my wife, who promised to be at the gate against my coming out, and waited there a great while.

1660-02-05 11:30 To Mr. Gunning, where a stranger preached a good honest sermon upon “What manner of love is this that we should be called the sons of God.”

1660-02-04 22:16 This day my wife killed her turkeys, that came out of Zealand, and could not get her m’d Jane by no means at any time to kill anything.

1660-02-04 16:50 Swan shewed us a ballad to the tune of Mardike which was most incomparably wrote, but the song proved but silly, so I did not write it out. 

1660-02-04 16:10 Met with an acquaintance of Solicitor Ellis in the walks, and went and drank, where I ate some bread and butter, having ate nothing all day.

1660-02-04 12:30 The Parliament this morning voted the House to be made up four hundred forthwith.

1660-02-04 09:45 In the morning at my lute an hour, and so to my office, where I staid expecting to have Mr. Squib come to me, but he did not.

1660-02-03 21:10 I went to see Mrs. Ann, who began very high about a flock bed I sent her, but I took her down. Here I played at cards till 9 o’clock.

1660-02-03 17:15 We went to the park, where Theoph. outran my wife and another poor woman, that laid a pot of ale with me that she would outrun her.

1660-02-03 16:10 In Monk's passing through the town he had many calls to him for a free Parliament, but little other welcome.

1660-02-03 14:45 To my house where we dined, but with a great deal of patience, for the mutton came in raw, and so we were fain to stay the stewing of it.

1660-02-03 13:25 We went walking all over White Hall, whither General Monk was newly come, and saw all his forces march by in good plight and stout officers.

1660-02-03 13:00 We went and bespoke a shoulder of mutton at Wilkinson’s to be roasted as well as it could be done, and sent a bottle of wine to my house.

1660-02-03 10:45 To Whitehall, where in the guard-chamber I saw about thirty or forty ‘prentices of the City, who were brought prisoners hither.

1660-02-03 09:10 To St. James’s Park, and walked there to my place for my flageolet and then played a little, it being a most pleasant morning and sunshine.

1660-02-03 08:30 Drank my morning draft at Harper’s, and was told there that the soldiers were all quiet upon promise of pay.

1660-02-02 23:50 We went to a sport called, selling of a horse for a dish of eggs and herrings, and sat talking there and then parted. Home and to bed.

1660-02-02 19:50 James the soldier came, who told us how they had been all day and night upon their guard at St. James’s.

1660-02-02 18:10 I went home, and changing my stockings and shoes, I having left off my great skirt suit, and put on my white suit with silver lace coat.

1660-02-02 17:00 A drum was heard to beat a march coming towards them, and they proved to be of the same mind; and so they made a great deal of joy.

1660-02-02 16:48 We did see the foot face the horse and beat them back, and stood bawling and calling in the street for a free Parliament and money.

1660-02-02 16:37 I took my money and went to Mrs. Johnson, and giving her my money to lay up, Doling and I went up stairs to a window, and looked out.

1660-02-02 08:50 To my office, where I found all the officers of the regiments in town, waiting to receive money that their soldiers might go out of town.

1660-02-01 22:15 Came home, where I found Mr. Hunt and his wife who staid and sat with me till 10 and so good night.

1660-02-01 21:00 I went to Will’s and staid like a fool there and played at cards till 9 o’clock.

1660-02-01 17:45 I took some bedding to send to Mrs. Ann for her to lie in now she hath her fits of the ague. 

1660-02-01 17:15 Colonel Fitch went to the Parliament, and commanded what money could be got for them, and all the rest of the soldiers, who made a mutiny.

1660-02-01 09:15 Went to my office where afterwards the old man brought me my letters from the carrier.
