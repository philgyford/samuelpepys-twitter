1660-02-29 20:10   My cosen Norton gave me a brave cup of metheglin, the first I ever drank.

1660-02-29 09:40   I drank at Will’s with Mr. Moore, who told me how my Lord is chosen General at Sea by the Council, and that it is thought that Monk will be joined with him therein.

1660-02-28 20:25 r I was indeed a little vexed with Mr. Sheply, but said nothing, about his breaking open of my study at my house, merely to give him the key of the stair door at my Lord’s, which lock he might better have broke than mine.

1660-02-28 20:15   Home, where I found Mr. Sheply, almost drunk, come to see me, afterwards Mr. Spong comes, with whom I went up and played with him a Duo or two.

1660-02-28 15:00   We met with Mr. Pierce, and he took us to the Greyhound Tavern, and gave us a pint of wine, and as the rest of the seamen do, talked very high again of my Lord.

1660-02-28 13:10   Shifted myself, and so to Mr. Crew’s, and then to Sir Harry Wright’s, where I found my Lord at dinner, who called for me in, and was glad to see me.

1660-02-28 12:20 r At Paul’s I light, Mr. Blayton holding my horse, where I found Dr. Reynolds in the pulpit, and General Monk there, who was to have a great entertainment at Grocers’ Hall.

1660-02-28 11:50   We found the shops all shut, and the militia of the red regiment in arms at the Old Exchange, among whom I found and spoke to Nich. Osborne, who told me that it was a thanksgiving-day through the City for the return of the Parliament.

1660-02-28 09:30 r To horse, and for London through the forest, where we found the way good, but only in one path, which we kept as if we had rode through a canal all the way.

1660-02-28 06:05 r Had some red herrings to our breakfast, while my boot-heel was a-mending, by the same token the boy left the hole as big as it was before.

1660-02-27 22:10 r The road pretty good, but the weather rainy to Epping, where we sat and played a game at cards, and after supper, and some merry talk with a plain bold maid of the house, we went to bed.

1660-02-27 16:24 r So we went to our Inn, and after eating of something, and kissed the daughter of the house, she being very pretty, we took leave.

1660-02-27 15:48 r They brought me a draft of their drink in a brown bowl, tipt with silver, which I drank off, and at the bottom was a picture of the Virgin and the child in her arms, done in silver.

1660-02-27 15:20 r We went to our Inn, and after eating of something, and kissed the daughter of the house, she being very pretty, we took leave.

1660-02-27 13:10 r My landlord carried us through a very old hospital or almshouse, where forty poor people was maintained; and over the chimney in the mantelpiece was an inscription in brass: “Orate pre anima Thomae Bird,” &c.; and the poor box also was on the same chimney-piece.

1660-02-27 11:27 r He took us into the cellar, where we drank most admirable drink, a health to the King. I played on my flageolette, there being an excellent echo. He showed us excellent pictures; two especially, those of the four Evangelists and Henry VIII. I gave the man 2s. for his trouble.

1660-02-27 10:30 r We took the master of the house to show us Audley End House, who took us on foot through the park, and so to the house, where the housekeeper showed us all the house, in which the stateliness of the ceilings, chimney-pieces, and form of the whole was exceedingly worth seeing.

1660-02-27 08:50 r I took my leave of my father, whom I left in bed, and the same of my brother John, to whom I gave 10s. Mr. Blayton and I took horse and straight to Saffron Walden, where at the White Hart, we set up our horses.

1660-02-26 23:10 r I took leave of all my friends, and so to my Inn, where I bade good night to my father, and John went to bed, but I staid up a little while, playing the fool with the lass of the house at the door of the chamber, and so to bed.

1660-02-26 20:30 r My father, Mr. Zanchy, and I to my Cosen Angier to supper, where I caused two bottles of wine to be carried from the Rose Tavern; that was drunk up, and I had not the wit to let them know at table that it was I that paid for them, and so I lost my thanks for them.

1660-02-26 19:20 r To my lodging, where we found my father and Mr. Pierce at the door, and I took them both and Mr. Blayton to the Rose Tavern, and there gave them a quart or two of wine, not telling them that we had been there before.

1660-02-26 17:35 r Sanchy and I to the Rose Tavern, where we sat and drank till sermon done, and then Mr. Pechell came to us, and we three sat drinking the King’s and his whole family’s health till it began to be dark.

1660-02-26 15:15 r After a cup of drink I went to Magdalene College to get the certificate of the College for my brother’s entrance there, that he might save his year.

1660-02-26 14:40 r I found Mr. Pierce at our Inn, who told us that he had lost his journey, for my Lord was gone from Hinchingbroke to London on Thursday last, at which I was a little put to a stand.

1660-02-26 11:30 r He took us to Botolph’s Church, where we heard Mr. Nicholas, of Queen’s College, who I knew in my time to be Tripos, with great applause, upon this text, “For thy commandments are broad.”

1660-02-26 10:00 r My father and I went out in the morning, and walked out in the fields behind King’s College, and in King’s College Chapel Yard, where we met with Mr. Fairbrother,

1660-02-25 22:32 r To my Inn, where I found my father in his chamber, and after some discourse, and he well satisfied with this day’s work, we went to bed, my brother lying with me, his things not being come by the carrier that he could not lie in the College.

1660-02-25 21:15 r In their discourse I could find that there was nothing at all left of the old preciseness in their discourse, specially on Saturday nights. And Mr. Zanchy told me that there was no such thing now-a-days among them at any time.

1660-02-25 21:10 r I and Mr. Zanchy went to Magdalene College, where a very handsome supper at Mr. Hill’s chambers, I suppose upon a club among them.

1660-02-25 17:30 r Mr. Fairbrother, my Cozen Angier, and Mr. Zanchy, whom I met at Mr. Merton’s shop (where I bought ‘Elenchus Motuum’, having given my former to Mr. Downing when he was here), to the Three Tuns, where we drank pretty hard and many healths to the King, &c.

1660-02-25 11:30 r I went to Magdalene College, to Mr. Hill, with whom I found Mr. Zanchy, Burton, and Hollins, and was exceeding civilly received by them.

1660-02-25 10:15 r After dressing myself, my father, brother, and I to Mr. Widdrington, at Christ’s College, who received us very civilly, and caused my brother to be admitted, while my father, he, and I, sat talking.

1660-02-25 07:50 r I lay with Mr. Pierce who we left here the next morning upon his going to Hinchingbroke to speak with my Lord before his going to London, and we two come to Cambridge.

1660-02-24 20:30 r Then up again and as far as Foulmer, within six miles of Cambridge, my mare being almost tired: here we lay at the Chequer, playing at cards till supper, which was a breast of veal roasted.

1660-02-24 12:20 r About Ware we overtook Mr. Blayton, brother-in-law to Dick Vines, who went thenceforwards with us, and at Puckeridge we baited, where we had a loin of mutton fried, and were very merry, but the way exceeding bad from Ware thither.

1660-02-24 07:10   I rose very early, and taking horse at Scotland Yard, at Mr. Garthwayt’s stable, I rode to Mr. Pierces, who rose, and in a quarter of an hour, leaving his wife in bed (with whom Mr. Lucy methought was very free as she lay in bed), we both mounted, and so set forth.

1660-02-23 21:50 r At Mrs. Michell’s shop staid talking a great while with her and my Chaplain, Mr. Mumford, and drank a pot or two of ale on a wager that Mr. Prin is not of the Council.

1660-02-23 17:30   To Westminster Hall, where, after the House rose, I met with Mr. Crew, who told me that my Lord was chosen by 73 voices, to be one of the Council of State. Mr. Pierpoint had the most, 101, and himself the next, too.

1660-02-23 12:40   With Mr. Fuller home to my house, where he dined with me, and he told my wife and me a great many stories of his adversities, since these troubles, in being forced to travel in the Catholic countries, &c.

1660-02-23 08:10   My birthday, now twenty-seven years.

1660-02-22 22:03   I observed this day how abominably Barebone’s windows are broke again last night.

1660-02-22 20:10   To supper, where my Uncle Fenner and my Aunt, The. Turner, and Joyce, at a brave leg of veal roasted, and were very merry against John’s going to Cambridge.

1660-02-22 16:45   I met with Will. Simons and Mr. Mabbot at Marsh’s, who told me how the House had this day voted that the gates of the City should be set up at the cost of the State. And that Major-General Brown’s being proclaimed a traitor be made void, and several other things of that nature.

1660-02-22 15:20   To Mrs. Jemimah, who now hath her instrument about her neck, and indeed is infinitely, altered, and holds her head upright.

1660-02-22 13:35   To my father’s to dinner, where nothing but a small dish of powdered beef and dish of carrots; they being all busy to get things ready for my brother John to go tomorrow.

1660-02-22 11:50   Walking in the Hall, I saw Major-General Brown, who had a long time been banished by the Rump, but now with his beard overgrown, he comes abroad and sat in the House.

1660-02-22 11:00   To my office and to Will’s, where Mr. Pierce found me out, and told me that he would go with me to Cambridge, where Colonel Ayre’s regiment, to which he was surgeon, lieth.

1660-02-21 19:40 r Here out of the window it was a most pleasant sight to see the City from one end to the other with a glory about it, so high was the light of the bonfires, and so thick round the City, and the bells rang everywhere.

1660-02-21 17:12 r Here we had variety of brave Italian and Spanish songs, and a canon for eight voices, which Mr. Lock had lately made on these words: “Domine salvum fac Regem,” an admirable thing.

1660-02-21 16:10 r To the Coffee House, till Captain Taylor came to us, who told us, that the House had voted the gates of the City to be made up again, and the members of the City that are in prison to be set at liberty; and that Sir G. Booth’s case be brought into the House tomorrow.

1660-02-21 13:30 r Mr. Crew advised me to send for my Lord forthwith, and told me that there is no question that, if he will, he may now be employed again; and that the House do intend to do nothing more than to issue writs, and to settle a foundation for a free Parliament.

1660-02-21 12:34 r Mr. Crew very joyful told me that the House had made General Monk, General of all the Forces in England, Scotland, and Ireland; and that upon Monk’s desire, for the service that Lawson had lately done in pulling down the Committee of Safety, he had the command of the Sea.

1660-02-21 10:30 r Mr. Prin came with an old basket-hilt sword on, and had a great many great shouts upon his going into the Hall.

1660-02-21 10:20 r They came to the House and went in one after another, and at last the Speaker came. But it is very strange that this could be carried so private, that the other members of the House heard nothing of all this, till they found them in the House.

1660-02-21 10:10 r So I to Westminster Hall, and in Chancery Row I saw about twenty of them who had been at White Hall with General Monk, who came thither this morning, and made a speech to them, and recommended to them a Commonwealth, and against Charles Stuart.

1660-02-21 08:40   Going out I saw many soldiers going towards Westminster, and was told that they were going to admit the secluded members again.

1660-02-20 20:40 r After a small debate upon the question whether learned or unlearned subjects are the best the Club broke up very poorly, and I do not think they will meet any more.

1660-02-20 19:30   Simons and I to the Coffee Club, where nothing to do only I heard Mr. Harrington, and my Lord of Dorset and another Lord, talking of getting another place as the Cockpit, and they did believe it would come to something.

1660-02-20 16:30   To Westminster Hall, where I met with Chetwind, Simons, and Gregory. And with them to Marsh’s at Whitehall to drink, and staid there a pretty while reading a pamphlet well writ and directed to General Monk in praise of the form of monarchy which was settled here before the wars.

1660-02-19 21:28   So home, and it raining my wife got my mother’s French mantle and my brother John’s hat, and so we went all along home and to bed.

1660-02-19 20:50   To Mrs. Turner where her brother, Mr. Edward Pepys, was there, and I sat a great while talking of public business of the times with him. So to supper to my Father’s, all supper talking of John’s going to Cambridge.

1660-02-19 17:20   I brought my wife to Mr. Mossum’s to hear him, and indeed he made a very good sermon, but only too eloquent for a pulpit. Here Mr. L’Impertinent helped me to a seat.

1660-02-19 16:00 r That there is great likelihood that the secluded members will come in, and so Mr. Crew and my Lord are likely to be great men, at which I was very glad.

1660-02-19 12:14   Mr. Moore told me the discourse that happened between the secluded members and members of the House. The secluded said that they did not intend by coming in to express revenge upon these men, but only to meet and dissolve themselves and only to issue writs for a free Parliament.

1660-02-19 11:30   To Mr. Gunning’s and heard an excellent sermon, and speaking of the character that the Scripture gives of Ann the mother of the blessed Virgin, he did there speak largely in commendation of widowhood, and not as we do to marry two or three wives or husbands, one after another.

1660-02-18 21:10   This day two soldiers were hanged in the Strand for their late mutiny at Somerset-house.

1660-02-18 20:20   With Mr. Wotton to an alehouse and drank while he told me a great many stories of comedies that he had formerly seen acted, and the names of the principal actors, and gave me a very good account of it.

1660-02-18 14:30   Home to dinner, and then went to my Lord’s lodgings to my turret there and took away most of my books, and sent them home by my maid.

1660-02-18 10:44   Looker, a famous gardener, told a strange passage in good earnest, how formerly Mr. Eglin did in his company put his finger, which being sore had a black case over it, into a woman’s belly, and left his case within her; which Mr. Eglin blushed but did not deny it.

1660-02-18 08:50   A great while at my vial and voice, learning to sing “Fly boy, fly boy,” without book.

1660-02-17 21:50   This day we are invited to my uncle Fenner’s wedding feast, but went not, this being the 27th year.

1660-02-17 20:10 r Mons. L’Impertinent and I to Harper’s, and there drank a cup or two to the King, and to his fair sister Frances good health, of whom we had much discourse of her not being much the worse for the small pox, which she had this last summer.

1660-02-17 19:02 r Mr. Hunt told me how Monk had sent for all his goods that he had here into the City; and that some of the members of the House had laid in firing into their lodgings at White Hall for a good while, so that we are at a great stand to think what will become of things.

1660-02-17 18:40   To Westminster Hall, where I heard that some of the members of the House were gone to meet with some of the secluded members and General Monk in the City.

1660-02-17 17:35   I wrote a letter to Mr. Downing about his business and gave it Mr. Hawly, and so went to Mr. Gunning’s to his weekly fast, and after sermon, meeting there with Monsieur L’Impertinent, we went and walked in the park till it was dark.

1660-02-17 11:50   I went into my study and did up my accounts, and found that I am about; 40l. beforehand in the world, and that is all.

1660-02-17 10:30   Came Mr. Hills the instrument maker, and I consulted with him about the altering my lute and my viall.

1660-02-16 19:20 r I by having but 3d. in my pocket made shift to spend no more, whereas if I had had more I had spent more as the rest did, so that I see it is an advantage to a man to carry little in his pocket.

1660-02-16 19:00 r In came Mr. Wade and his friend Capt. Moyse (who told us of his hopes to get an estate merely for his name’s sake), and here we staid, I winning a quart of sack of Shaw that one trencherfull that was sent us was all lamb and he that it was veal.

1660-02-16 13:40 r Here I met with Osborne and with Shaw and Spicer, and we went to the Sun Tavern in expectation of a dinner, where we had sent us only two trenchers-full of meat, at which we were very merry.

1660-02-16 10:40   To my office, where I wrote by the carrier to my Lord and sealed my letter at Will’s, and gave it old East to carry it to the carrier’s, and to take up a box of china oranges and two little barrels of scallops at my house, which Captain Cuttance sent to me for my Lord.

1660-02-15 21:45   No news today, but all quiet to see what the Parliament will do about the issuing of the writs tomorrow for filling up of the House, according to Monk’s desire.

1660-02-15 15:12   To Hering the merchant about my Lord’s Worcester money and back to Paul’s Churchyard, where I staid reading in Fuller’s History of the Church of England an hour or two.

1660-02-15 13:40   To Mr. Crew’s, where the dining room being full, Mr. Walgrave and I dined below in the buttery by ourselves upon a good dish of buttered salmon.

1660-02-15 10:00   With Mr. Hill of Worcestershire to Will’s, where I gave him a letter to Nan Pepys, and some merry pamphlets against the Rump to carry to her into the country.

1660-02-14 21:50   To Will’s, where like a fool I staid and lost 6d. at cards.

1660-02-14 17:11   Parliament hath changed the oath so much talked of to a promise; among other qualifications for the members to be chosen, one is that no man, nor the son of any man that hath been in arms during the life of the father, shall be capable of being chosen to sit in Parliament.

1660-02-14 11:00   To Westminster Hall, there being many new remonstrances and declarations from many counties to Monk and the City, and one coming from the North from Sir Thomas Fairfax.

1660-02-14 09:35   Called out in the morning by Mr. Moore, whose voice my wife hearing in my dressing-chamber with me, got herself ready, and came down and challenged him for her valentine, this being the day.

1660-02-13 16:50   At my father’s I staid a while, while my mother sent her maid Bess to Cheapside for some herbs to make a water for my mouth.

1660-02-13 15:00   I went to Playford’s, and for two books that I had and 6s. 6d. to boot I had my great book of songs which he sells always for 14s.

1660-02-13 12:20   To my office till noon, thence home to dinner, my mouth being very bad of the cancer and my left leg beginning to be sore again.

1660-02-12 22:00   So to bed, where my wife and I had some high words upon my telling her that I would fling the dog which her brother gave her out of window if he pissed the house any more.

1660-02-12 18:45   Home, and being near home we missed our maid, and were at a great loss and went back a great way to find her, but when we could not see her we went homewards and found her there, got before us which we wondered at greatly.

1660-02-12 17:10 r To my father’s, where Charles Glascocke was overjoyed to see how things are now; who told me the boys had last night broke Barebone’s windows.

1660-02-12 16:04 r To Mr. Turner’s, where I found my wife, Mr. Edw. Pepys, and Roger and Mr. Armiger being there, to whom I gave as good an account of things as I could.

1660-02-12 14:20 r But not knowing how to see Monk we went and walked half a hour in Moorfields, which were full of people, it being so fine a day.

1660-02-12 13:30   I heard that Monk had been at Paul’s in the morning, and the people had shouted much at his coming out of the church. In the afternoon he was at a church in Broad-street, whereabout he do lodge.

1660-02-12 12:45   At noon came according to my invitation my cos. Thos. Pepys and his partner and dined with me, but before dinner we went and took a walk round the park, it being a most pleasant day as ever I saw.

1660-02-12 10:00   I heard that Sir Arth. Haselrigge was newly gone into the City to Monk, and that Monk’s wife removed from White Hall last night.

1660-02-11 23:05 r Indeed it was past imagination, both the greatness and the suddenness of it. At one end of the street you would think there was a whole lane of fire, and so hot that we were fain to keep still on the further side merely for heat.

1660-02-11 22:25 r The butchers at the May Pole in the Strand rang a peal with their knives when they were going to sacrifice their rump. On Ludgate Hill there was one turning of the spit that had a rump tied upon it, and another basting of it.

1660-02-11 22:20 r The number of bonfires, there being fourteen between St. Dunstan’s and Temple Bar, and at Strand Bridge I could at one view tell thirty-one fires. In King-street seven or eight; and all along burning, and roasting, and drinking for rumps.

1660-02-11 21:15 r In Cheapside there was a great many bonfires, and Bow bells and all the bells in all the churches as we went home were a-ringing. The common joy that was every where to be seen!

1660-02-11 20:10 r I saw many people give the soldiers drink and money, and all along in the streets cried, “God bless them!” and extraordinary good words.

1660-02-11 19:04 r The Parliament had sent Scott and Robinson to Monk this afternoon, but he would not hear them. And that the Mayor and Aldermen had offered him their own houses for himself and his officers; and that his soldiers would lack for nothing.

1660-02-11 18:50 r The late petition of the fanatique people presented by Barebone, for the imposing of an oath upon all sorts of people, was received by the House with thanks.

1660-02-11 18:40 r Lambert and Vane are now in town, contrary to the vote of Parliament. That there were many in the House that do press for new oaths to be put upon men; whereas we have more cause to be sorry for the many oaths that we have already taken and broken.

1660-02-11 17:35 r I went alone to Guildhall to see whether Monk was come again or no, and met with him coming out of the chamber where he had been with the Mayor and Aldermen, but such a shout I never heard in all my life, crying out, “God bless your Excellence.”

1660-02-11 17:04 r We stayed a great while, and at last meeting with a friend of his we went to the 3 Tun tavern and drank half a pint of wine, and not liking the wine we went to an alehouse, where we met with company of this third man’s acquaintance, and there we drank a little.

1660-02-11 15:10 r We took coach for the City to Guildhall, where the Hall was full of people expecting Monk and Lord Mayor to come thither, and all very joyfull.

1660-02-11 14:30 r At last, within Temple Bar, we found a pullet ready roasted, and there we dined.

1660-02-11 14:00 r I met with Mr. Chetwind, who had not dined no more than myself, and so we went toward London, in our way calling at two or three shops, but could have no dinner.

1660-02-11 13:25 r I saw the Speaker reading of the letter; and after it was read, Sir A. Haselrigge came out very angry, and Billing standing at the door, took him by the arm, and cried, “Thou man, will thy beast carry thee no longer? thou must fall!”

1660-02-11 13:15   I walked in the Hall, where I heard the news of a letter from Monk, who was now gone into the City, and did resolve to stand for the sudden filling up of the House, and it was very strange how the countenance of men in the Hall was all changed with joy in half an hour’s time.

1660-02-11 11:55   I lay long abed, and then to my office, where I read all the morning my Spanish book of Rome.

1660-02-10 20:30 r The City look mighty blank, and cannot tell what in the world to do; the Parliament having this day ordered that the Common-council sit no more; but that new ones be chosen according to what qualifications they shall give them.

1660-02-10 19:10 r He also told me what Monk had done in the City, how he had pulled down the most part of the gates and chains that they could break down, and that he was now gone back to White Hall.

1660-02-10 18:45   With Mr. Moore went into London to Mr. Fage about the cancer in my mouth, which begins to grow dangerous, who gave me something for it.

1660-02-10 17:40 r Our lawyer made some kind of opposition, but to no purpose, and so the cause was found against us, and the foreman of the jury brought in 10l. damages, which the whole Court cried shame of, and so he cried 12d. Thence I went home, vexed about this business.

1660-02-10 17:10   To the Exchequer, where I heard all the afternoon a great many causes before the Barons; in the end came ours, and Squib proved clearly by his patent that the house and office did now belong to him.

1660-02-10 16:30   To my office, where I got money of Mr. Hawly to pay the lawyer, and there found Mr. Lenard, one of the Clerks of the Council, and took him to the Swan and gave him his morning draft.

1660-02-10 11:15   I got money of Mr. Hawly to pay the lawyer and found Mr. Lenard, one of the Clerks, and took him to the Swan and gave him his morning draft.

1660-02-10 10:00   To the Exchequer, where the Barons were hearing of causes, and there I made affidavit that Mr. Downing was gone into Holland by order of the Council of State, and this affidavit I gave to Mr. Stevens our lawyer.

1660-02-09 20:50   I went home and got some ahlum to my mouth, where I have the beginnings of a cancer, and had also a plaster to my boil underneath my chin.

1660-02-09 19:10   I called at Mr. Harper’s, who told me how Monk had this day clapt up many of the Common-council, and that the Parliament had voted that he should pull down their gates and portcullisses, their posts and their chains, which he do intend to do, and do lie in the City all night.

1660-02-09 14:35   Swan and I to a drinking-house near Temple Bar, where while he wrote I played on my flageolet till a dish of poached eggs was got ready for us, which we eat.

1660-02-09 12:30   I wrote to my Lord after I had been at the Upper Bench, where Sir Robert Pye this morning came to desire his discharge from the Tower; but it could not be granted.

1660-02-09 11:20   I understand how Monk is gone into London with his army; and I met with Mr. Fage, who told me that he do believe that Monk is gone to secure some of the Common-council of the City, who were very high, and did vote that they would not pay any taxes till the House was filled up.

1660-02-09 06:45   Before I was out of my bed, I heard the soldiers very busy, getting their horses ready where they lay at Hilton’s, but I knew not then their meaning in so doing.

1660-02-08 22:15   Went to bed with my head not well by my too much drinking today, and I had a boil under my chin which troubled me cruelly.

1660-02-08 21:05   I went away homewards, and in Fleet Street, received a great jostle from a man that had a mind to take the wall, which I could not help.

1660-02-08 17:45   To my father’s, where he showed me a base angry letter that he had newly received from my uncle Robert about my brother John, at which my father was very sad, but I comforted him and wrote an answer.

1660-02-08 15:10   Sending a porter with the hamper of bottles to the Temple I called in my way upon Mrs. Jem, who was much frighted till I came to tell her that her mother was well.

1660-02-08 13:40   At home my wife’s brother brought her a pretty black dog which I liked very well, and went away again.

1660-02-08 09:30   I was called on by Mr. Fossan, my fellow pupil at Cambridge, and I took him to the Swan in the Palace yard, and drank together our morning draft.

1660-02-08 08:00   A little practice on my flageolet, and afterwards walking in my yard to see my stock of pigeons, which begin now with the spring to breed very fast.

1660-02-07 20:50 r Boys do now cry “Kiss my Parliament, instead of “Kiss my arse,” so great and general a contempt is the Rump come to among all the good and bad.

1660-02-07 20:10 r Mr. Moore told me of a picture hung up at the Exchange of a great pair of buttocks shooting of a turd into Lawson’s mouth, and over it was wrote “The thanks of the house.”

1660-02-07 19:00   Mr. Crew told me that my Lord St. John is for a free Parliament, and that he is very great with Monk, who hath now the absolute command and power to do any thing that he hath a mind to do.

1660-02-07 15:40   Home, where I found a letter from my Lord in character, which I construed. I went to Mr. Crew and advised with him about it, it being concerning my Lord’s coming up to Town, which he desires upon my advice the last week in my letter.

1660-02-07 14:30   To the Hall, where in the Palace I saw Monk’s soldiers abuse Billing and all the Quakers, that were at a meeting-place there, and indeed the soldiers did use them very roughly and were to blame.

1660-02-07 12:50 r After all the speeches, in which my brother John came off as well as any of the rest, I went straight home and dined.

1660-02-07 11:10 r To school, where he that made the speech for the seventh form in praise of the founder, did show a book which Mr. Crumlum had lately got, which is believed to be of the Founder’s own writing.

1660-02-07 10:40   I went to Paul’s School, but it being too soon, went and drank my morning draft with my cozen Tom Pepys the turner, and saw his house and shop.

1660-02-06 22:20   I went to Will’s, where I staid at cards till 10 o’clock, losing half a crown, and so home to bed.

1660-02-06 16:30   I to Mrs. Ann, and Mrs. Jem being gone out of the chamber she and I had a very high bout, I rattled her up, she being in her bed, but she becoming more cool, we parted pretty good friends.

1660-02-06 13:20   My father dined with me upon my turkey that was brought from Denmark, and after dinner he and I to the Bull Head Tavern, where we drank half a pint of wine and so parted.

1660-02-06 11:10 r To the Hall, where I stood upon the steps and saw Monk go by, he making observance to the judges as he went along.

1660-02-06 09:30   To Westminster and walked with Mr. Crew thither, where we found the soldiers all set in the Palace Yard, to make way for General Monk to come to the House.

1660-02-05 21:40   Before going to bed I staid writing of this day its passages, while a drum came by, beating of a strange manner of beat, now and then a single stroke, which my wife and I wondered at, what the meaning of it should be.

1660-02-05 16:20 r At church I saw Dick Cumberland newly come out of the country from his living, but did not speak to him.

1660-02-05 16:15 r To their church, and in Mrs. Turner’s pew my wife took up a good black hood and kept it. A stranger preached a poor sermon, and so read over the whole book of the story of Tobit.

1660-02-05 13:25 r I went to my house and finding my wife gone I returned and called at the Chequers, thinking to dine at the ordinary with Mr. Chetwind and Mr. Thomas, but they not being there I went to my father and found her there, and there I dined.

1660-02-05 12:00 r After sermon I could not find my wife, who promised to be at the gate against my coming out, and waited there a great while.

1660-02-05 11:30   To Mr. Gunning, where a stranger, an old man, preached a good honest sermon upon “What manner of love is this that we should be called the sons of God.”

1660-02-04 22:16   This day my wife killed her turkeys that Mr. Sheply gave her, that came out of Zealand with my Lord, and could not get her m’d Jane by no means at any time to kill anything.

1660-02-04 22:07   All the news today is, that the Parliament this morning voted the House to be made up four hundred forthwith.

1660-02-04 22:05   I went home and wrote letters into the country by the post, and then played awhile on my lute, and so done, to supper and then to bed.

1660-02-04 18:20   I met with Spicer, Washington, and D. Vines in Lincoln’s Inn Court, and they were buying of a hanging jack to roast birds on of a fellow that was there selling of some.

1660-02-04 16:50   Swan showed us a ballad to the tune of Mardike which was most incomparably wrote in a printed hand, which I borrowed of him, but the song proved but silly, and so I did not write it out.

1660-02-04 16:10   We met with an acquaintance of Solicitor Ellis in the walks, and went and drank, where I ate some bread and butter, having ate nothing all day, while they were by chance discoursing of Marriot, the great eater, so that I was, I remember, ashamed to eat what I would have done.

1660-02-04 09:45   In the morning at my lute an hour, and so to my office, where I staid expecting to have Mr. Squib come to me, but he did not.

1660-02-03 21:10   I went to see Mrs. Ann, who began very high about a flock bed I sent her, but I took her down. Here I played at cards till 9 o’clock.

1660-02-03 17:20 r I returned, and it growing dark I and they went to take a turn in the park, where Theoph. (who was sent for to us to dinner) outran my wife and another poor woman, that laid a pot of ale with me that she would outrun her.

1660-02-03 16:25 r I saw how unwilling some of the old soldiers were yet to go out of town without their money, and swore if they had it not in three days they would do them more mischief in the country than if they had staid here; and that is very likely, the country being all discontented.

1660-02-03 16:10   I went to hear news, but only found that the Parliament House was most of them with Monk at White Hall, and that in his passing through the town he had many calls to him for a free Parliament, but little other welcome.

1660-02-03 14:45 r To my house where we dined, but with a great deal of patience, for the mutton came in raw, and so we were fain to stay the stewing of it.

1660-02-03 13:25 r Mrs. Turner and I and Joyce went walking all over White Hall, whither General Monk was newly come, and we saw all his forces march by in very good plight and stout officers.

1660-02-03 13:00 r We went and bespoke a shoulder of mutton at Wilkinson’s to be roasted as well as it could be done, and sent a bottle of wine home to my house.

1660-02-03 12:40 r With my cozen Roger Pepys, it being term time, we took him out of the Hall to Priors, the Rhenish wine-house, and there had a pint or two of wine and a dish of anchovies, and bespoke three or four dozen bottles of wine for him against his wedding.

1660-02-03 12:10   Mrs. Turner came to speak with me, and Joyce, and I took them and showed them the manner of the Houses sitting, the doorkeeper very civilly opening the door for us.

1660-02-03 10:45   To Whitehall, where in the guard-chamber I saw about thirty or forty ’prentices of the City, who were taken at twelve o’clock last night and brought prisoners hither.

1660-02-03 09:10   To St. James’s Park, and walked there to my place for my flageolet and then played a little, it being a most pleasant morning and sunshine.

1660-02-03 08:30   Drank my morning draft at Harper’s, and was told there that the soldiers were all quiet upon promise of pay.

1660-02-02 23:50 r After all this we went to a sport called selling of a horse for a dish of eggs and herrings, and sat talking there till almost twelve o’clock and then parted, they were to go as far as Aldgate.

1660-02-02 19:50 r James the soldier came, who told us how they had been all day and night upon their guard at St. James’s, and that through the whole town they did resolve to stand to what they had began, and that tomorrow he did believe they would go into the City, and be received there.

1660-02-02 18:10 r I took my money, and went home on foot and laying up my money, and changing my stockings and shoes, I this day having left off my great skirt suit, and put on my white suit with silver lace coat, and went over to Harper’s.

1660-02-02 17:00 r By and by a drum was heard to beat a march coming towards them, and they got all ready again and faced them, and they proved to be of the same mind with them; and so they made a great deal of joy to see one another.

1660-02-02 16:37 r I took my money and went to Mrs. Johnson, my Lord’s sempstress, and giving her my money to lay up, Doling and I went up stairs to a window, and see the foot face the horse and beat them back, and stood bawling and calling in the street for a free Parliament and money.

1660-02-02 16:15   After I had received the money we went to the Bridge Tavern and drank a quart of wine and so back by water, landing Mr. Calthrop’s man at the Temple and we went homewards but over against Somerset House, hearing the noise of guns, we landed and found the Strand full of soldiers.

1660-02-02 08:50   Drank at Harper’s with Doling, and so to my office, where I found all the officers of the regiments in town, waiting to receive money that their soldiers might go out of town, and what was in the Exchequer they had.

1660-02-01 22:15   I went to Will’s and staid like a fool there and played at cards till 9 o’clock and so came home, where I found Mr. Hunt and his wife who staid and sat with me till 10 and so good night.

1660-02-01 17:45   I took some bedding to send to Mrs. Ann for her to lie in now she hath her fits of the ague.

1660-02-01 17:15 r Colonel Fitch went to the Parliament, and commanded what money could be got, to be got against tomorrow for them, and all the rest of the soldiers in town, who in all places made a mutiny this day, and do agree together.

1660-02-01 17:00   Took Gammer East, and James the porter, a soldier, to my Lord’s lodgings, who told me how they were drawn into the field today, and that they were ordered to march away tomorrow to make room for General Monk.

1660-02-01 15:15   To Mrs. Jem and spoke with Madam Scott and her husband who did promise to have the thing for her neck done this week.

1660-02-01 13:30   I went to the Hall and there met with Mr. Swan and went with him to Mr. Downing’s Counsellor, who did put me in very little hopes about the business between Mr. Downing and Squib, and told me that Squib would carry it against him, at which I was much troubled.

1660-02-01 12:40   I went home and dined with my wife on pease porridge and nothing else.

1660-02-01 09:15   Went to my office where afterwards the old man brought me my letters from the carrier.
