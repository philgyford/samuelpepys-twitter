1660-02-29 20:10   My cosen Norton gave me a brave cup of metheglin, the first I ever drank. 

1660-02-29 09:40   Mr. Moore told me how my Lord is chosen General at Sea by the Council, and that it is thought that Monk will be joined with him therein.

1660-02-28 20:15   Home, where I found Mr. Sheply, almost drunk, come to see me, afterwards Mr. Spong comes, with whom I went up and played with him a Duo.

1660-02-28 13:10   To Mr. Crew’s, and then to Sir Harry Wright’s, where I found my Lord at dinner, who called for me in, and was glad to see me.

1660-02-28 11:55   I found and spoke to Nich. Osborne, who told me that it was a thanksgiving-day through the City for the return of the Parliament.

1660-02-28 11:40   We found the shops all shut, and the militia of the red regiment in arms at the Old Exchange. 

1660-02-28 09:30   For London through the forest, where we found the way good, but only in one path, which we kept as if we had rode through a canal.

1660-02-28 06:05   Had some red herrings to our breakfast, while my boot-heel was a-mending, by the same token the boy left the hole as big as it was before.

1660-02-27 20:40   The road pretty good, but the weather rainy to Eping, where we sat and played a game at cards.

1660-02-27 15:20   We went to our Inn, and after eating of something, and kissed the daughter of the house, she being very pretty, we took leave.

1660-02-27 13:10   My landlord carried us through a very old almshouse, where forty poor people was maintained; a very old foundation.

1660-02-27 12:00   He shewed us excellent pictures; two especially, those of the four Evangelists and Henry VIII. After that I gave the man 2s for his trouble.

1660-02-27 10:30   We took the master of the house to shew us Audley End House, in which the form of the whole was exceedingly worth seeing.

1660-02-27 09:00   Mr. Blayton and I took horse and straight to Saffron Walden, where at the White Hart, we set up our horses.

1660-02-27 04:10   Up, and after I was ready, took my leave of my father, whom I left in bed, and the same of my brother John, to whom I gave 10s.

1660-02-26 23:10   I bade good night to my father, but I staid up a little while, playing the fool with the lass of the house at the door of the chamber.

1660-02-26 20:30   I caused two bottles of wine to be carried; and I had not the wit to let them know it was I that paid for them, and so I lost my thanks.

1660-02-26 19:00   I took my father, and Mr. Pierce, and Mr. Blayton to the Rose Tavern, and gave them wine, not telling them that we had been there before.

1660-02-26 17:35   To the Rose Tavern, where we sat and drank, and then Mr. Pechell came to us, and we sat drinking the King’s and his whole family’s health.

1660-02-26 15:15   I went to Magdalene College to get the certificate of the College for my brother’s entrance there, that he might save his year.

1660-02-26 14:40   Found Mr. Pierce at our Inn, who told us that my Lord was gone from Hinchingbroke to London, at which I was a little put to a stand. 

1660-02-26 11:30   We heard Mr. Nicholas, of Queen’s College, who I knew in my time to be Tripos, with great applause, upon “For thy commandments are broad.”

1660-02-26 10:00   My father and I walked out in the fields behind King’s College, and we met with Mr. Fairbrother, who took us to Botolph’s Church.

1660-02-25 21:15   In their discourse I could find that there was nothing at all left of the old preciseness in their discourse, specially on Saturday nights.

1660-02-25 21:00   I and Mr. Zanchy went to Magdalene College, where a very handsome supper at Mr. Hill’s chambers, I suppose upon a club among them.

1660-02-25 17:30   Mr. Fairbrother, my Cozen Angier, and Mr. Zanchy, to the Three Tuns, where we drank pretty hard and many healths to the King, &c.

1660-02-25 11:30   I went to Magdalene College, to Mr. Hill, with whom I found Mr. Zanchy, Burton, and Hollins, and was exceeding civilly received by them.

1660-02-25 10:15   My father, brother, and I to Mr. Widdririgton, at Christ’s College, who received us very civilly, and caused my brother to be admitted.

1660-02-25 07:50   We two come to Cambridge. To the Falcon, in the Petty Cury, where we found my father and brother very well.

1660-02-24 20:30   We lay at the Chequer, playing at cards till supper, which was a breast of veal roasted.

1660-02-24 16:30   Up again and as far as Foulmer, within six miles of Cambridge, my mare being almost tired.

1660-02-24 12:20   About Ware we overtook Mr. Blayton, brother-in-law to Dick Vines, who went thenceforwards with us, and at Puckeridge we baited.

1660-02-24 07:10   Taking horse at Scotland Yard, I rode to Mr. Pierces, who rose, and in a quarter of an hour, we both mounted, and so set forth.

1660-02-23 21:50   At Mrs. Michell’s shop staid talking a while with her and Mr. Mumford and drank a pot of ale on a wager that Mr. Prin is not of the Council.

1660-02-23 17:30   Mr. Crew told me my Lord was chosen by 73 voices to be one of the Council of State. Mr. Pierpoint had the most, 101, and himself the next.

1660-02-23 12:40   Mr. Fuller told my wife and me many stories of his adversities, since these troubles, in being forced to travel in the Catholic countries.

1660-02-23 08:10   My birthday, now twenty-seven years.

1660-02-22 20:10   To supper, where my Uncle Fenner and Aunt, The., and Joyce at a brave leg of veal roasted, and were merry against John’s going to Cambridge.

1660-02-22 15:20   To Mrs. Jemimah, who now hath her instrument about her neck, and indeed is infinitely, altered, and holds her head upright.

1660-02-22 11:50   I saw Major-General Brown, who had been banished by the Rump, but now with his beard overgrown, he comes abroad and sat in the House.

1660-02-22 11:00   Mr. Pierce found me out, and told me that he would go with me to Cambridge, where Colonel Ayre’s regiment, to which he was surgeon, lieth. 

1660-02-21 20:40   It was a most pleasant sight to see the City from one end to the other with a glory about it, so high was the light of the bonfires.

1660-02-21 16:10   The House has voted the gates of the City to be made up again, and the members of the City that are in prison to be set at liberty.

1660-02-21 13:45   The House do intend to do nothing more than to issue writs, and to settle a foundation for a free Parliament.

1660-02-21 13:30   Mr. Crew advised me to send for my Lord forthwith, and told me that there is no question that, if he will, he may now be employed again.

1660-02-21 13:10   The House had made General Monk, General of all the Forces in England, Scotland, and Ireland.

1660-02-21 10:30   Mr. Prin came with an old basket-hilt sword on, and had a great many great shouts upon his going into the Hall.

1660-02-21 10:10   General Monk, who came to White Hall this morning, made a speech to them and recommended to them a Commonwealth, and against Charles Stuart.

1660-02-21 08:40   Going out I saw many soldiers going towards Westminster, and was told that they were going to admit the secluded members again.

1660-02-20 20:40   After a debate upon whether learned or unlearned subjects are the best the Club broke up poorly, and I do not think they will meet any more.

1660-02-20 19:10   To the Coffee Club. I heard Mr. Harrington talking of getting another place as the Cockpit, and they did believe it would come to something.

1660-02-20 16:30   Reading a pamphlet well writ and directed to General Monk, in praise of the form of monarchy which was settled here before the wars.

1660-02-19 20:40   So home, and it raining my wife got my mother’s French mantle and my brother John’s hat, and so we went all along home and to bed.

1660-02-19 18:10   To Mrs. Turner where her brother, Mr. Edward Pepys, was there, and I sat a great while talking of public business of the times with him.

1660-02-19 16:00   Home, and brought my wife to Mr. Mossum’s to hear him, and indeed he made a very good sermon, but only too eloquent for a pulpit.

1660-02-19 11:30   Mr. Gunning did speak largely in commendation of widowhood, and not as we do to marry two or three wives or husbands, one after another.

1660-02-18 21:10   This day two soldiers were hanged in the Strand for their late mutiny at Somerset-house.

1660-02-18 20:20   With Mr. Wotton to an alehouse and drank while he told me many great stories of comedies that he had formerly seen acted.

1660-02-18 14:30   Home to dinner, and then went to my Lord’s lodgings to my turret there and took away most of my books, and sent them home by my maid.

1660-02-18 08:50   A great while at my vial and voice, learning to sing “Fly boy, fly boy,” without book.

1660-02-17 21:50   This day we are invited to my uncle Fenner’s wedding feast, but went not, this being the 27th year.

1660-02-17 11:50   I went into my study and did up my accounts, and found that I am about; 40l. beforehand in the world, and that is all. 

1660-02-17 10:30   Came Mr. Hills the instrument maker, and I consulted with him about the altering my lute and my viall.

1660-02-16 19:10   By having but 3d. in my pocket made shift to spend no more, whereas if I had had more I had spent more. It is an advantage to carry little.

1660-02-16 13:51   I winning a quart of sack of Shaw that one trencherfull that was sent us was all lamb and he that it was veal.

1660-02-16 13:40   I met with Osborne, Shaw and Spicer and we went to the Sun in expectation of a dinner, where we had sent us only two trenchers-full of meat.

1660-02-16 10:40   I wrote to my Lord, and gave it old East to carry it to the carrier's, and to take up a box of china oranges and two barrels of scallops.

1660-02-15 21:45   All quiet to see what the Parliament will do about the issuing of the writs for filling up of the House, according to Monk’s desire.

1660-02-15 13:40   To Mr. Crew’s, where the dining room being full, Mr. Walgrave and I dined below in the buttery by ourselves upon a dish of buttered salmon.

1660-02-15 10:00   With Mr. Hill to Will’s, where I gave him a letter to Nan Pepys, and some merry pamphlets against the Rump to carry to her into the country.

1660-02-14 21:50   To Will’s, where like a fool I staid and lost 6d. at cards.

1660-02-14 09:35   Called out by Mr. Moore, whose voice my wife hearing in my dressing-chamber, came down and challenged him for her valentine.

1660-02-13 15:00   I went to Playford’s, and for two books that I had and 6s. 6d. to boot I had my great book of songs which he sells always for 14s.

1660-02-13 12:20   To my office till noon, thence home to dinner, my mouth being very bad of the cancer and my left leg beginning to be sore again.

1660-02-12 22:00   My wife and I had some high words upon my telling her that I would fling the dog out at the window if he pissed the house any more.

1660-02-12 19:20   Charles Glascocke was overjoyed to see how things are now; who told me the boys had last night broke Barebone’s windows.

1660-02-12 12:15   Before dinner we went and took a walk round the park, it being a most pleasant day as ever I saw.

1660-02-12 10:00   I heard that Sir Arth. Haselrigge was newly gone into the City to Monk, and that Monk’s wife removed from White Hall last night.

1660-02-11 23:05   At one end of the street you would think there was a whole lane of fire, so hot we were fain to keep on the further side merely for heat.

1660-02-11 22:45   The butchers at the May Pole in the Strand rang a peal with their knives when they were going to sacrifice their rump.

1660-02-11 22:31   All along burning, and roasting, and drinking for rumps. There being rumps tied upon sticks and carried up and down.

1660-02-11 22:20   The number of bonfires, there being fourteen between St. Dunstan’s and Temple Bar, and at Strand Bridge I could tell thirty-one fires.

1660-02-11 22:05   In Cheapside there was a great many bonfires, and Bow bells and all the bells in all the churches as we went home were a-ringing.

1660-02-11 20:30   I saw many people give the soldiers drink and money, and all along in the streets cried, “God bless them!” and extraordinary good words. 

1660-02-11 18:50   Many in the House press for new oaths to be put upon men; whereas we have cause to be sorry for the oaths we have already taken and broken.

1660-02-11 14:45   We took coach to Guildhall, where the Hall was full of people expecting Monk and Lord Mayor to come thither, and all very joyfull.

1660-02-11 13:26   At last, within Temple Bar, we found a pullet ready roasted, and there we dined. 

1660-02-11 13:15   I met with Mr. Chetwind who had dined no more than myself and we went toward London, calling at two or three shops but could have no dinner.

1660-02-11 12:40   Sir A. Haselrigge came out angry and Billing took him by the arm and cried, “Thou man, will thy beast carry thee no longer? thou must fall!”

1660-02-11 12:05   I heard the news of a letter from Monk, who was now gone into the City again, and did resolve to stand for the filling up of the House.

1660-02-10 20:30   Parliament has ordered that the Common-council sit no more; but that new ones be chosen according to qualifications they shall give them.

1660-02-10 19:10   Monk has pulled down the most part of the gates and chains that they could break down, and he is now gone back to White Hall.

1660-02-10 18:45   I went into London to Mr. Fage about the cancer in my mouth, which begins to grow dangerous, who gave me something for it.

1660-02-10 17:40   I went home, vexed about this business.

1660-02-10 17:10   Squib proved clearly by his patent that the house and office did belong to him. Our lawyer made some kind of opposition, but to no purpose.

1660-02-10 16:30   To the Exchequer, where I heard all the afternoon a great many causes before the Barons.

1660-02-10 11:15   I got money of Mr. Hawly to pay the lawyer and found Mr. Lenard, one of the Clerks, and took him to the Swan and gave him his morning draft.

1660-02-10 10:00   To the Exchequer, and there I made affidavit that Mr. Downing was gone into Holland by order of the Council of State.

1660-02-09 20:50   I went home and got some ahlum to my mouth, where I have the beginnings of a cancer, and had also a plaster to my boil underneath my chin.

1660-02-09 19:10   The Parliament voted that Monk should pull down the Common-council's gates and portcullisses, which he do intend to do.

1660-02-09 14:35   Swan and I to a drinking-house near Temple Bar, where while he wrote I played on my flageolet till a dish of poached eggs was got ready.

1660-02-09 12:30   I wrote to my Lord after I had been at the Upper Bench. Sir Robert Pye came to desire his discharge from the Tower; it could not be granted.

1660-02-09 11:20   Monk is gone to secure some of the Common-council of the City, who did vote that they would not pay any taxes till the House was filled up.

1660-02-09 06:45   I heard the soldiers very busy, getting their horses ready where they lay at Hilton’s, but I knew not their meaning in so doing.

1660-02-08 22:15   Went to bed with my head not well by my too much drinking to-day, and I had a boil under my chin which troubled me cruelly.

1660-02-08 21:05   I went away homewards, and in Fleet Street, received a great jostle from a man that had a mind to take the wall, which I could not help.

1660-02-08 17:45   My father shewed me a base angry letter that he had received from my uncle Robert about my brother John, at which my father was very sad.

1660-02-08 15:10   Sending a porter with the bottles to the Temple I called upon Mrs. Jem, who was frighted till I came to tell her that her mother was well.

1660-02-08 13:40   At home my wife’s brother brought her a pretty black dog which I liked very well, and went away again.

1660-02-08 09:30   I was called on by Mr. Fossan, my fellow pupil at Cambridge. I took him to the Swan in the Palace yard and drank together our morning draft.

1660-02-08 08:00   A little practice on my flageolet, and afterwards in my yard to see my stock of pigeons, which begin now with the spring to breed very fast.

1660-02-07 20:50   Boys do now cry “Kiss my Parliament, instead of “Kiss my arse,” so great a contempt is the Rump come to among all the good and bad.

1660-02-07 20:10   A picture at the Exchange of a pair of buttocks shooting of a turd into Lawson’s mouth, and over it was wrote “The thanks of the house.”

1660-02-07 19:00   My Lord St. John is for a free Parliament, and he is very great with Monk, who hath now the absolute command and power to do any thing.

1660-02-07 15:10   I found a letter from my Lord in character, which I construed. I advised with Mr. Crew about it, it concerning my Lord’s coming up to Town.

1660-02-07 14:30   I saw Monk’s soldiers abuse all the Quakers, that were at a meeting-place, and indeed the soldiers did use them roughly and were to blame.

1660-02-07 11:10   To Paul's School, where he that made the speech did show a book which Mr. Crumlum had lately got, which is of the Founder’s own writing.

1660-02-06 22:20   I went to Will’s, where I staid at cards till 10 o’clock, losing half a crown, and so home to bed.

1660-02-06 16:30   To Mrs. Ann, and she and I had a very high bout, I rattled her up, she being in her bed, but she becoming more cool, we parted good friends.

1660-02-06 13:20   My father dined with me upon my turkey that was brought from Denmark, and after dinner he and I to the Bull Head Tavern.

1660-02-06 11:10   To to the Hall, where I stood upon the steps and saw Monk go by, he making observance to the judges as he went along. 

1660-02-06 09:30   To Westminster, where we found the soldiers all set in the Palace Yard, to make way for General Monk to come to the House.

1660-02-05 20:40   A drum came by, beating of a strange manner of beat, which my wife and I wondered at, what the meaning of it should be.

1660-02-05 16:15   In Mrs. Turner’s pew my wife took up a good black hood and kept it. A stranger preached a poor sermon.

1660-02-05 12:00   After sermon I could not find my wife, who promised to be at the gate against my coming out, and waited there a great while.

1660-02-05 11:30   To Mr. Gunning, where a stranger preached a good honest sermon upon “What manner of love is this that we should be called the sons of God.”

1660-02-04 22:16   This day my wife killed her turkeys, that came out of Zealand, and could not get her m’d Jane by no means at any time to kill anything.

1660-02-04 22:05   I went home and wrote letters into the country by the post, and then played awhile on my lute, and so done, to supper and then to bed.

1660-02-04 18:20   I met with Spicer, Washington, and D. Vines in Lincoln’s Inn Court, and they were buying of a hanging jack to roast birds on.

1660-02-04 16:50   Swan shewed us a ballad to the tune of Mardike which was most incomparably wrote, but the song proved but silly, so I did not write it out. 

1660-02-04 16:10   Met with an acquaintance of Solicitor Ellis in the walks, and went and drank, where I ate some bread and butter, having ate nothing all day.

1660-02-04 12:30   The Parliament this morning voted the House to be made up four hundred forthwith.

1660-02-04 09:45   In the morning at my lute an hour, and so to my office, where I staid expecting to have Mr. Squib come to me, but he did not.

1660-02-03 21:10   I went to see Mrs. Ann, who began very high about a flock bed I sent her, but I took her down. Here I played at cards till 9 o’clock.

1660-02-03 17:15   We went to the park, where Theoph. outran my wife and another poor woman, that laid a pot of ale with me that she would outrun her.

1660-02-03 16:10   In Monk's passing through the town he had many calls to him for a free Parliament, but little other welcome.

1660-02-03 14:45   To my house where we dined, but with a great deal of patience, for the mutton came in raw, and so we were fain to stay the stewing of it.

1660-02-03 13:25   We went walking all over White Hall, whither General Monk was newly come, and saw all his forces march by in good plight and stout officers.

1660-02-03 13:00   We went and bespoke a shoulder of mutton at Wilkinson’s to be roasted as well as it could be done, and sent a bottle of wine to my house.

1660-02-03 12:40   We took my cozen Roger Pepys to Priors and there bespoke three or four dozen bottles of wine for him against his wedding.

1660-02-03 12:10   I took Mrs. Turner and Joyce, and shewed them the manner of the Houses sitting, the doorkeeper very civilly opening the door for us.

1660-02-03 10:45   To Whitehall, where in the guard-chamber I saw about thirty or forty ‘prentices of the City, who were brought prisoners hither.

1660-02-03 09:10   To St. James’s Park, and walked there to my place for my flageolet and then played a little, it being a most pleasant morning and sunshine.

1660-02-03 08:30   Drank my morning draft at Harper’s, and was told there that the soldiers were all quiet upon promise of pay.

1660-02-02 23:50   We went to a sport called, selling of a horse for a dish of eggs and herrings, and sat talking there and then parted. Home and to bed.

1660-02-02 19:50   James the soldier came, who told us how they had been all day and night upon their guard at St. James’s.

1660-02-02 18:10   I went home, and changing my stockings and shoes, I having left off my great skirt suit, and put on my white suit with silver lace coat.

1660-02-02 17:00   A drum was heard to beat a march coming towards them, and they proved to be of the same mind; and so they made a great deal of joy.

1660-02-02 16:48   We did see the foot face the horse and beat them back, and stood bawling and calling in the street for a free Parliament and money.

1660-02-02 16:37   I took my money and went to Mrs. Johnson, and giving her my money to lay up, Doling and I went up stairs to a window, and looked out.

1660-02-02 16:26   Over against Somerset House, hearing the noise of guns, we landed and found the Strand full of soldiers.

1660-02-02 16:15   We went to the Bridge Tavern and drank a quart of wine and so back by water, landing Mr. Calthrop’s man at the Temple and we went homewards.

1660-02-02 08:50   To my office, where I found all the officers of the regiments in town, waiting to receive money that their soldiers might go out of town.

1660-02-01 22:15   Came home, where I found Mr. Hunt and his wife who staid and sat with me till 10 and so good night.

1660-02-01 21:00   I went to Will’s and staid like a fool there and played at cards till 9 o’clock.
