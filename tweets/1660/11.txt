1660-11-30 23:55   I went up and sat till twelve at night again to make an end of my Lord’s accounts, as I did the last night.

1660-11-30 20:20   I sent for Mr. Hater, and broke the other barrel of oysters with him, and did afterwards sit down discoursing of sea terms to learn of him.

1660-11-30 12:00   I having two barrels of oysters at home I caused one of them and some wine to be brought to the office, and there the Officers did eat them.

1660-11-30 00:00   In a great ease of mind and spirit I fell about the auditing of Mr. Shepley’s accounts with my Lord, till I began to doze, and so to bed.

1660-11-29 08:41   Mr. Davis did seem ready to have it stopt, and did tell me how thieves did attempt to rob his house last night, which do make us all afraid.

1660-11-29 08:30   Seeing a great deal of foul water come into my parlour from under the partition between me and Mr. Davis, I did step thither to him.

1660-11-28 21:50   Among the officers do hear that they may have our salaries allowed by the Treasurer, which do make me very glad, and praise God for it.

1660-11-28 12:00   With Mr. Shepley and Pinkney to the Sun, and did give them a glass of wine and a peck of oysters for joy of my getting this money.

1660-11-28 11:10   To my Lord’s, where Major Hart did pay me; 23l. 14s. 9d., due to me upon my pay in my Lord’s troop at the time of our disbanding.

1660-11-27 23:00   I do remember I did leave my boy Waineman at Whitehall with order to stay there for me, at which I was troubled, but the boy came home well.

1660-11-27 17:20   Mr. Moore told me how the House had this day voted the King to have all the Excise for ever.

1660-11-27 14:00   To my Lord’s, where I found my wife, and she and I dined with him and my Lady, and my Lord did show us great respect.

1660-11-27 10:40   In King Street there was a falling out between a drayman and my Lord Chesterfield’s coachman, and one of his footmen killed.

1660-11-27 10:00   I found my Lord gone to the Wardrobe, whither he do now go every other morning, and do resolve to understand and look after the business.

1660-11-26 21:50   Home, there hear that my Lady Batten had given my wife a visit (the first that ever she made her), which pleased me exceedingly.

1660-11-26 19:40   The Comptroller and I to the Mitre to a glass of wine, when we fell into a discourse of poetry.

1660-11-26 13:30   To it all the morning, and dined at home where my father dined with me, who seems to take pleasure to have a son that is neat in his house.

1660-11-25 19:30   I went home, where I had a letter brought me from my Lord to get a ship ready to carry the Queen’s things over to France.

1660-11-25 17:00   To my father’s to see my mother who is troubled much with the stone.

1660-11-25 15:20   After dinner I went and ranged about to many churches, among the rest to the Temple, where I heard Dr. Wilkins a little.

1660-11-24 22:10   I fell to entering these two good songs of Mr. Lawes, “Helpe, helpe, O helpe,” and “O God of Heaven and Hell” in my song book.

1660-11-24 15:20   I to Mr. de Cretz and did take away my Lord’s picture, and I paid 3l. 10s. for it and the frame, and am well pleased with it and the price.

1660-11-24 13:40   I dined with my lady, there being Mr. Child and Mrs. Borfett, who are never absent at dinner there, under pretence of a wooing.

1660-11-23 11:00   Capt. Straughan did talk what he is able to advise the King for good husbandry in his ships. I do believe that he is a knowing man.

1660-11-22 17:10   I to the new playhouse and saw part of the “Traitor,” a very good Tragedy; Mr. Moon did act the Traitor very well.

1660-11-22 15:20   To Mr. Fox’s again, where many gentlemen dined with us, and most princely dinner, all provided for me and my friends.

1660-11-22 14:25   My wife standing near the Princess Henrietta with two or three black patches on, and well dressed, did seem to me much handsomer than she.

1660-11-22 14:14   The Princess Henrietta's dressing of herself with her hair frized short up to her ears, did make her seem so much the less to me.

1660-11-22 14:03   The Princess Henrietta is very pretty, but much below my expectation.

1660-11-22 13:52   The Princess of Orange I had often seen before.

1660-11-22 13:41   The Queen a very little plain old woman, and nothing more in her presence in any respect nor garb than any ordinary woman.

1660-11-22 13:30   Mr. Fox got my wife placed behind the Queen’s chair, and I got into the crowd. By and by the Queen and the two Princesses came to dinner.

1660-11-22 13:15   Mr. Fox came in presently and did receive us with a great deal of respect; and then did take my wife and I to the Queen’s presence-chamber.

1660-11-22 13:00   To Mr. Fox’s, where we found an alderman of London paying 1500l. in gold for the King, which was the most gold that ever I saw in my life.

1660-11-22 12:30   My wife and I walked to the Old Exchange, and there she bought her a white whisk and put it on, and I a pair of gloves.

1660-11-21 23:10   I sent for the barber, who staid so long with me that he was locked into the house, and we were fain to call up Griffith, to let him out.

1660-11-21 20:12   I took much pleasure to have the neighbours come forth into the yard to hear me.

1660-11-21 20:00   To my viallin (the first time that I have played on it since I came to this house) in my dining room, and afterwards to my lute.

1660-11-21 11:30   My wife went home, and I to Pope’s Head, and bought me an aggate hafted knife, which cost me 5s.

1660-11-21 10:50   My wife and I went to Paternoster Row, and there we bought some green watered moyre for a morning wastecoate.

1660-11-21 09:10   My cozen Thomas Pepys, the turner, sent me a cupp of lignum vitae for a token.

1660-11-20 18:10   Home, where I found the house in a washing pickle, and my wife in a joyful condition when I told her that she is to see the Queen.

1660-11-20 14:30   I saw the first time one Moone, said to be the best actor in the world, and indeed it is the finest play-house that ever was in England.

1660-11-20 13:00   To the new Play-house near Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields (formerly Gibbon’s tennis-court), where the play of “Beggar’s Bush” was newly begun.

1660-11-20 10:45   My Lord did commit the viewing of these accounts to me, which was a great joy to me to see that he do look upon me as one to put trust in.

1660-11-20 10:30   I staid with my Lord and Mr. Shepley, looking over my Lord’s accounts and to set matters straight between him and Shepley.

1660-11-20 08:40   I rose and with Will to my Lord’s by land, it being a very hard frost, the first we have had this year.

1660-11-20 02:00   So to my musique and sat up late at it, and so to bed, leaving my wife to sit up till 2 o’clock that she may call the wench up to wash.

1660-11-19 14:40   To the Globe, and did choose two pictures to hang up which my wife did not like when I came home. So I sent the picture of Paris back again.

1660-11-19 10:50   To see my Lord’s picture at De Cretz, and he says it is very like him, and I say so too.

1660-11-18 20:00   After sermon my Lady took us home and there we supped with her and Sir W. Batten, and Pen, and were much made of.

1660-11-18 11:30   To our own church, where Mr. Powel (a crook legged man that went formerly with me to Paul’s School), preached a good sermon.

1660-11-17 14:20   I dined with my Lady and my Lady Pickering, where her son John dined with us, who do continue a fool as he ever was since I knew him.

1660-11-16 23:20   We went to a barrel of oysters at Sir W. Batten’s, and so home, and I to the setting of my papers in order, which did keep me up late.

1660-11-16 15:35   He does it as a favour to me to offer to come in upon a way of getting of money, which they call Bottomry, which I do not yet understand.

1660-11-16 15:20   To discourse about the putting out of 80l. to a man who would give me 15l. per annum for 8 years for it which I did not think profit enough.

1660-11-16 10:00   Mr. Fontleroy and I to the Swan, and in discourse he seems to be wise and say little, though I know things are changed against his mind.

1660-11-15 22:10   I found my wife much satisfied with my Lord’s discourse and respect to her, and so after prayers to bed.

1660-11-15 12:10   I did leave my wife to dine with my Lord, the first time he did take notice of her as my wife, and did seem to have a just esteem for her.

1660-11-15 11:30   I got my wife carried in to my Lady, who was hiring of a French maid. They could not understand one another till my wife came to interpret.

1660-11-15 10:40   I leave my picture with Mr. de Cretz to copy out another for himself, and took the original by a porter with me to my Lord’s.

1660-11-15 10:10   I did see Mr. de Cretz give some finishing touches to my Lord’s picture, so at last it is complete to my mind.

1660-11-15 09:40   To Westminster, and it being very cold upon the water I went all alone to the Sun and drank a draft of mulled white wine.

1660-11-14 23:20   We did drink a great quantity of sack and did tell many merry stories, and in good humours we were all.

1660-11-14 21:50   To the Dolphin, where we found Sir W. Batten, who is seldom a night from hence.

1660-11-14 11:00   I went into Cheapside to Mr. Beauchamp’s, to look out a piece of plate to give Mr. Fox from my Lord, and did choose a gilt tankard.

1660-11-14 10:10   This day was the first that we do begin to sit in the afternoon, and not in the forenoon.

1660-11-13 14:40   Not knowing the nature of her oven, my wife did heat it too hot, and so overbake her things, but knows how to do better another time.

1660-11-13 13:50   Home to dinner, where I found my wife making of pies and tarts to try her oven with, which she has never yet done.

1660-11-13 08:10   I took Mr. Moore to the Wardrobe; indeed there is a great deal of room in it, but very ugly till my Lord hath bestowed great cost upon it.

1660-11-13 07:30   I met with Mr. Moore, who was going to my house, and indeed I found him to be a most careful, painful, and able man in business.

1660-11-12 16:00   Pall promised me that she would, and with many thanks did weep for joy, which did give me and my wife some content and satisfaction.

1660-11-12 15:47   We went all together into the little room, and there I told Pall what my mind was, to have her come not as a sister, but as a servant.

1660-11-12 15:35   We discoursed about my sister’s coming to live with me, which I have much mind for her good to have, and yet I am afeard of her ill-nature.

1660-11-12 15:20   To my father’s, where I found my wife buying of a tablecloth and a dozen of napkins of diaper, the first that ever I bought in my life.

1660-11-12 12:00   To De Cretz, where I saw my Lord’s picture finished, which do please me very well.

1660-11-12 11:10   Mr. Comptroller and I sat a while at the office to do business, and thence I went with him to his house in Lime Street, a fine house.

1660-11-11 20:10   Dr. Thomas Pepys told my brother that he loved my wife so well that if she had a child he would never marry, but leave all to my child.

1660-11-11 15:00   I saw Mr. Fox's lady, Mrs. Elizabeth Whittle, whom I had a great opinion of, and did make an anagram or two upon her name when I was a boy.

1660-11-11 11:45   This day also did Mr. Mills begin to read all the Common Prayer, which I was glad of.

1660-11-11 11:26   I hope it will not always be so, it not being handsome for our servants to sit so equal with us.

1660-11-11 11:15   There being no woman this day, we sat in the foremost pew, and behind us our servants.

1660-11-11 11:00   Sir W. Batten and I went to Church into our new gallery, the first time it was used, and it not being yet quite finished.

1660-11-10 22:15   This night going home, Will and I bought a goose.

1660-11-10 22:00   After reading of that and the comedy of the Rump, which is also very silly, I went to bed.

1660-11-10 20:10   To Paul’s Churchyard, and there bought Montelion, which this year do not prove so good as the last was; so after reading it I burnt it.

1660-11-10 15:30   We went with a foul copy to the Parliament house, where we met Sir Clarges and Mr. Spry, and after we had given them satisfaction we parted.

1660-11-10 09:00   Sir Wm. Batten and I to make up an account of the wages of the officers and mariners, ready to present to the Committee of Parliament. 

1660-11-09 22:10   To my father’s and staid late talking with my father about my sister Pall’s coming to live with me if she would come and be as a servant.

1660-11-09 16:30   To Whitehall where I found my Lord, who had an organ set up to-day in his dining-room, but it seems an ugly one in the form of Bridewell.

1660-11-09 14:00   Good sport with Mr. Talbot, who eats no sort of fish, and there was nothing else till we sent for a neat’s tongue.

1660-11-09 13:40   To dinner, where we had Mr. Shepley, Talbot, Adams, Chaplin and Osborne, our dinner given us by Mr. Ady and Mr. Wine, the King’s fishmonger.

1660-11-09 09:20   Lay long in bed this morning though an office day, because of our going to bed late last night.

1660-11-09 02:30   So home, where I found my wife up, she shewed me her head which was very well dressed to-day, she having been to see her father and mother.

1660-11-09 01:45   We sat very late doing the work and waiting for the tide, it being moonshine we got to London before two in the morning.

1660-11-08 18:10   Went forward in my walk with some men, and in our way we met with many merry seamen that had got their money paid them to-day.

1660-11-08 16:50   Being troubled with a looseness, I went to an alehouse at the end of Ratcliffe, and did give a groat for a pot of ale, and there I did shit.

1660-11-08 16:30   With Commissioner Pett as far as Ratcliffe, where I left him, and I (unwilling to leave the rest of the officers) went back to Deptford.

1660-11-08 15:50   Commissioner Pett and I went on board the yacht, which is one of the finest things that ever I saw for neatness in so small a vessel.

1660-11-08 14:30   I went to Mr. Davys’s and saw his house (where I was once before a great while ago) and I found him a very pretty man.

1660-11-07 18:30   This was the first day of the proclamation against hackney coaches coming into the streets to be hired, yet I got one to carry me home.

1660-11-07 17:20   Bowyer told me how my wife’s brother had a horse at grass with him, which I was troubled to hear, it being his boldness upon my score.

1660-11-07 16:00   I went to see my Lord’s picture, which is almost done, and do please me very well.

1660-11-07 14:20   My Lord did tell me how the King had promised him 4000l. per annum for ever, and had already given him a bill under his hand.

1660-11-07 13:40   My Lord did say it was gratitude did bring him to his obedience to the King; and did also bless himself with his good fortune.

1660-11-07 06:00   This night I was troubled all night with a dream that my wife was dead, which made me that I slept ill all night.

1660-11-06 21:15   I would have my will, and so we went to bed and lay all night in a quarrel.

1660-11-06 21:00   My wife and I did fall out about the dog’s being put down into the cellar, which I had a mind to have done because of his fouling the house.

1660-11-06 17:20   I fell a-reading of the tryalls of the late men that were hanged for the King’s death, and found good satisfaction in reading thereof.

1660-11-06 15:20   The ships were the Indian, sold for 1,300l., and the Half-moon, sold for 830l.

1660-11-06 14:40   To our office, where we met all, for the sale of two ships by an inch of candle (the first time that ever I saw any of this kind).

1660-11-05 21:40   This 5th of November is observed exceeding well in the City; and at night great bonfires and fireworks.

1660-11-05 20:00   Mr. Moore came and sat with me, and there I took a book and he did instruct me in many law notions, in which I took great pleasure.

1660-11-05 10:20   Being disappointed of money, we failed of going to Deptford to pay off the Henrietta to-day.

1660-11-04 21:50   My wife seemed very pretty to-day, it being the first time I had given her leave to wear a black patch.

1660-11-04 19:00   To my father’s, where I found my mother in greater and greater pain of the stone.

1660-11-04 17:30   Much company I found to come to Mrs. Pearse, and cannot wonder at it, for she is very pretty and wanton.

1660-11-04 17:10   With Mr. Pearse and Mr. Sheply, calling at the Bell to see the seven Flanders mares that my Lord has bought, where we drank Hull ale. 

1660-11-04 14:50   I went to my Lord’s, and having spoke with him, I went to the Abbey, where the first time that ever I heard the organs in a cathedral!

1660-11-04 11:45   This declaration of the King’s do give the Presbyterians some satisfaction, and a pretence to read the Common Prayer.

1660-11-04 11:30   To church where Mr. Mills did begin to nibble at the Common Prayer, by saying “Glory be to the Father, &c” after he had read the two psalms.

1660-11-03 16:40   We took Mrs. Lane to the alehouse, where I made her angry with commending of Tom Newton and her new sweetheart to be both too good for her.

1660-11-03 14:30   To White Hall, where my Lord and Lady were gone to kiss the Queene’s hand.

1660-11-02 21:40   I observed few bonfires in the City, for the Queen’s coming; whereby I guess that (as I believed before) her coming do please but very few.

1660-11-02 20:00   In Paul’s church-yard I called at Kirton’s, and there they had got a mass book for me, which I bought and cost me twelve shillings.

1660-11-02 19:20   Took coach at White Hall and carried Mr. Childe as far as the Strand, and myself got as far as Ludgate by all the bonfires.

1660-11-02 18:40   I supt with my Lord he being merry, telling merry stories of the country mayors, how they entertained the King all the way as he come along.

1660-11-02 17:10   I was told the Queen was a-coming; so I got a sculler for sixpence to carry me thither and back again, but I could not get to see the Queen.

1660-11-02 16:50   To White Hall, where when I came I saw the boats going very thick to Lambeth, and all the stairs to be full of people.

1660-11-02 16:10   With Mr. Cooke that made the silver bosses, and Mr. Stephens the silversmith to the tavern, and did give them a pint of wine.

1660-11-02 15:00   I saw some silver bosses put upon my new Bible, which cost me 6s. 6d. the making, and 7s. 6d. the silver.

1660-11-02 13:50   Mr. Holliard dined with me, with whom I had great discourse concerning the cure of the King’s evil, which he do deny any effect at all.

1660-11-01 21:00   So home by moonlight, it being about 9 o’clock before we got home.

1660-11-01 19:30   We called at Bow and drank there, and took leave of Mr. Johnson of Blackwall, who dined with us and rode with us thus far.

1660-11-01 17:00   From Sir W. Batten's house to an ale-house near the church, where we sat and drank and were merry, and so we mounted for London again.

1660-11-01 14:25   I was much afraid that Mr. Christmas would have remembered the words that I said the day the King was beheaded.

1660-11-01 14:10   Mr. Christmas did remember that I was a great Roundhead when I was a boy.

1660-11-01 13:50   Here dined with us two or three more country gentle men; among the rest Mr. Christmas, my old school-fellow, with whom I had much talk.

1660-11-01 12:10   Sir W. Batten showed us a chair, where he that sits down is catched with two irons, that come round about him, which makes good sport.

1660-11-01 10:50   We came to Sir W. Batten’s, where he lives like a prince, and we were made very welcome.

1660-11-01 10:20   Sir W. Pen and I were mounted early, and had very merry discourse all the way, he being very good company.
