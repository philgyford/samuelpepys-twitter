1660-11-22 14:25 My wife standing near the Princess Henrietta with two or three black patches on, and well dressed, did seem to me much handsomer than she.

1660-11-22 14:14 The Princess Henrietta's dressing of herself with her hair frized short up to her ears, did make her seem so much the less to me.

1660-11-22 14:03 The Princess Henrietta is very pretty, but much below my expectation.

1660-11-22 13:52 The Princess of Orange I had often seen before.

1660-11-22 13:41 The Queen a very little plain old woman, and nothing more in her presence in any respect nor garb than any ordinary woman.

1660-11-20 10:30 I staid with my Lord and Mr. Shepley, looking over my Lord’s accounts and to set matters straight between him and Shepley.

1660-11-20 08:40 I rose and with Will to my Lord’s by land, it being a very hard frost, the first we have had this year.

1660-11-19 14:40 To the Globe, and did choose two pictures to hang up which my wife did not like when I came home. So I sent the picture of Paris back again.

1660-11-16 15:20 To discourse about the putting out of 80l. to a man who would give me 15l. per annum for 8 years for it which I did not think profit enough.

1660-11-16 10:00 Mr. Fontleroy and I to the Swan, and in discourse he seems to be wise and say little, though I know things are changed against his mind.

1660-11-15 22:10 I found my wife much satisfied with my Lord’s discourse and respect to her, and so after prayers to bed.

1660-11-15 12:10 I did leave my wife to dine with my Lord, the first time he did take notice of her as my wife, and did seem to have a just esteem for her.

1660-11-15 11:30 I got my wife carried in to my Lady, who was hiring of a French maid. They could not understand one another till my wife came to interpret.

1660-11-15 10:40 I leave my picture with Mr. de Cretz to copy out another for himself, and took the original by a porter with me to my Lord’s.

1660-11-15 10:10 I did see Mr. de Cretz give some finishing touches to my Lord’s picture, so at last it is complete to my mind.

1660-11-15 09:40 To Westminster, and it being very cold upon the water I went all alone to the Sun and drank a draft of mulled white wine.

1660-11-14 23:20 We did drink a great quantity of sack and did tell many merry stories, and in good humours we were all.

1660-11-14 11:00 I went into Cheapside to Mr. Beauchamp’s, to look out a piece of plate to give Mr. Fox from my Lord, and did choose a gilt tankard.

1660-11-14 10:10 This day was the first that we do begin to sit in the afternoon, and not in the forenoon.

1660-11-13 14:40 Not knowing the nature of her oven, my wife did heat it too hot, and so overbake her things, but knows how to do better another time.

1660-11-13 13:50 Home to dinner, where I found my wife making of pies and tarts to try her oven with, which she has never yet done.

1660-11-13 08:10 I took Mr. Moore to the Wardrobe; indeed there is a great deal of room in it, but very ugly till my Lord hath bestowed great cost upon it.

1660-11-13 07:30 I met with Mr. Moore, who was going to my house, and indeed I found him to be a most careful, painful, and able man in business.

1660-11-12 16:00 Pall promised me that she would, and with many thanks did weep for joy, which did give me and my wife some content and satisfaction.

1660-11-12 15:47 We went all together into the little room, and there I told Pall what my mind was, to have her come not as a sister, but as a servant.

1660-11-12 15:35 We discoursed about my sister’s coming to live with me, which I have much mind for her good to have, and yet I am afeard of her ill-nature.

1660-11-11 15:00 I saw Mr. Fox's lady, Mrs. Elizabeth Whittle, whom I had a great opinion of, and did make an anagram or two upon her name when I was a boy.

1660-11-11 11:45 This day also did Mr. Mills begin to read all the Common Prayer, which I was glad of.

1660-11-11 11:26 I hope it will not always be so, it not being handsome for our servants to sit so equal with us.

1660-11-11 11:15 There being no woman this day, we sat in the foremost pew, and behind us our servants.

1660-11-11 11:00 Sir W. Batten and I went to Church into our new gallery, the first time it was used, and it not being yet quite finished.

1660-11-10 22:15 This night going home, Will and I bought a goose.

1660-11-09 16:30 To Whitehall where I found my Lord, who had an organ set up to-day in his dining-room, but it seems an ugly one in the form of Bridewell.

1660-11-09 14:00 Good sport with Mr. Talbot, who eats no sort of fish, and there was nothing else till we sent for a neat’s tongue.

1660-11-09 13:40 To dinner, where we had Mr. Shepley, Talbot, Adams, Chaplin and Osborne, our dinner given us by Mr. Ady and Mr. Wine, the King’s fishmonger.

1660-11-08 16:30 With Commissioner Pett as far as Ratcliffe, where I left him, and I (unwilling to leave the rest of the officers) went back to Deptford.

1660-11-08 15:50 Commissioner Pett and I went on board the yacht, which is one of the finest things that ever I saw for neatness in so small a vessel.

1660-11-08 14:30 I went to Mr. Davys’s and saw his house (where I was once before a great while ago) and I found him a very pretty man.

1660-11-07 18:30 This was the first day of the proclamation against hackney coaches coming into the streets to be hired, yet I got one to carry me home.

1660-11-07 17:20 Bowyer told me how my wife’s brother had a horse at grass with him, which I was troubled to hear, it being his boldness upon my score.

1660-11-07 14:20 My Lord did tell me how the King had promised him 4000l. per annum for ever, and had already given him a bill under his hand.

1660-11-07 13:40 My Lord did say it was gratitude did bring him to his obedience to the King; and did also bless himself with his good fortune.

1660-11-07 06:00 This night I was troubled all night with a dream that my wife was dead, which made me that I slept ill all night.

1660-11-06 21:15 I would have my will, and so we went to bed and lay all night in a quarrel.

1660-11-06 21:00 My wife and I did fall out about the dog’s being put down into the cellar, which I had a mind to have done because of his fouling the house.

1660-11-06 17:20 I fell a-reading of the tryalls of the late men that were hanged for the King’s death, and found good satisfaction in reading thereof.

1660-11-06 14:40 To our office, where we met all, for the sale of two ships by an inch of candle (the first time that ever I saw any of this kind).

1660-11-05 20:00 Mr. Moore came and sat with me, and there I took a book and he did instruct me in many law notions, in which I took great pleasure.

1660-11-04 19:00 To my father’s, where I found my mother in greater and greater pain of the stone.

1660-11-04 17:30 Much company I found to come to Mrs. Pearse, and cannot wonder at it, for she is very pretty and wanton.

1660-11-04 14:50 I went to my Lord’s, and having spoke with him, I went to the Abbey, where the first time that ever I heard the organs in a cathedral!

1660-11-03 14:30 To White Hall, where my Lord and Lady were gone to kiss the Queene’s hand.

1660-11-02 21:40 I observed few bonfires in the City, for the Queen’s coming; whereby I guess that (as I believed before) her coming do please but very few.

1660-11-02 20:00 In Paul’s church-yard I called at Kirton’s, and there they had got a mass book for me, which I bought and cost me twelve shillings.

1660-11-01 17:00 From Sir W. Batten's house to an ale-house near the church, where we sat and drank and were merry, and so we mounted for London again.

1660-11-01 14:25 I was much afraid that Mr. Christmas would have remembered the words that I said the day the King was beheaded.

1660-11-01 14:10 Mr. Christmas did remember that I was a great Roundhead when I was a boy.

1660-11-01 13:50 Here dined with us two or three more country gentle men; among the rest Mr. Christmas, my old school-fellow, with whom I had much talk.
