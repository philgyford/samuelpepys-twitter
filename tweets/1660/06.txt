1660-06-08 06:20   Out early, took horses at Deale.

1660-06-07 20:35   The Presbyterians would be angry if they durst, but they will not be able to do any thing.

1660-06-07 02:50   The people began to wash the deck, and the water came pouring into my mouth, which waked me.

1660-06-07 01:10   W. Howe called me up to give him a letter to carry to my Lord that came to me to-day, which I did and so to, sleep again.

1660-06-06 14:40   Mr. Cooke told me that my wife he left well at Huntsmore though her health not so constant as it used to be, which my heart is troubled for.

1660-06-06 09:30   I had letters come. I had a great deal of talk about my uncle Robert. He told me that he could not tell how his mind stood as to his estate.

1660-06-05 21:40   My Lord called for the lieutenant’s cittern, and with two candlesticks with money in them for symballs, we made barber’s music.

1660-06-05 20:30   In the evening in my cabin a great while getting the song without book, “Help, help Divinity, &c.”

1660-06-05 15:10   I got my Lord to sign my accounts for 115l., and so upon my private balance I find myself confirmed in my estimation that I am worth 100l.

1660-06-04 19:35   I took the opportunity to send all my Dutch money to be changed for English money, which is the first venture that ever I made.

1660-06-04 19:20   I made an order for Captain Sparling of the Assistance to go to Middleburgh, to fetch over some of the King’s goods.

1660-06-04 10:40   The King’s Proclamation against drinking, swearing, and debauchery was read to our ships’ companies, and it gives great satisfaction to all.

1660-06-04 04:10   Waked to give some money to Mr. Hetly, who was to go to London with the letters that I wrote yesterday night.

1660-06-03 16:10   To set my papers in order, they being increased much upon my hands through want of time to put them in order.

1660-06-03 14:30   To cast my accounts up, and find myself to be worth near 100l., for which I bless Almighty God, it being more than I hoped for so soon.

1660-06-03 07:20   Captain Holland tells me how every man goes to the Lord Mayor to set down their names, as such as do accept of his Majesty’s pardon.

1660-06-03 06:30   Waked by one who when I asked who it was, he told me one from Bridewell, which proved Captain Holland.

1660-06-02 17:20   Captain Sparling told us a story, about a gentleman that persuaded a country fool to let him gut his oysters or else they would stink.

1660-06-02 12:10   Their pay comes to 6,538l., and the Charles particularly 777l.

1660-06-02 09:50   Computing how much the thirty ships that come with the King their pay comes to for a month (because he promised to give them a month’s pay).

1660-06-02 09:25   Says my Lord, “We must have a little patience and we will rise together; in the mean time I will do you all the good jobs I can.”

1660-06-02 09:10   I took occasion to give my Lord thanks for his love to me in the share that he had given me of his Majesty’s money, and the Duke’s.

1660-06-02 07:00   The Captain told me that the Vice-Admiral, Rear-Admiral, and he had been drinking all day.

1660-06-01 22:10   The Captain come on board, when I was going to bed, quite fuddled.

1660-06-01 21:50   I think myself happier in my wife and estate than the Joyces are in theirs.

1660-06-01 21:35   The Joyces grow very rich and very proud but it is no matter, and there was talk that I should be knighted by the King, which they laugh at.

1660-06-01 21:20   My poor wife has not been well a week before, but thanks be to God is well again. She would fain see me, but we must be content.

1660-06-01 20:40   The Parliament had ordered the 29th of May, the King’s birthday, to be kept as a day of thanksgiving for our redemption from tyranny.

1660-06-01 20:20   Mr. Cooke comes from London with letters, leaving all things there very gallant and joyful.

1660-06-01 16:50   Captain Jefferys and W. Howe, and the Lieutenant and I to ninepins, where I lost about two shillings and so fooled away all the afternoon.

1660-06-01 10:30   I did give Mr. Sheply the fine pair of buckskin gloves that I bought myself about five years ago.

1660-06-01 10:10   Mr. Sheply disposed of the money that the Duke of York did give my Lord’s servants, 22 ducatoons came to my share.
