1660-07-31 22:50   Late home by coach so far as Ludgate with Mr. Mathews, and thence home on foot with W. Hewer with me, and so to bed.

1660-07-31 21:30   I took Mr. Crofts and Mathews to the Sun Tavern and there made them drink, and discoursed concerning the office.

1660-07-31 17:10   To the Admiralty, and there was doing things in order to the calculating of the debts of the Navy and other business, all the afternoon.

1660-07-31 09:50   My Lord and the principal officers met, and had a great discourse about raising of money for the Navy, which is in very sad condition.

1660-07-30 21:40   We sat late, discoursing about the worth of my office of Clerk of the Acts, which Mr. Man hath a mind to buy. I asked four years’ purchase.

1660-07-30 15:45   I got my 50l., due to me for my first quarter’s salary as Secretary to my Lord, which Tho. Hater received and brought home to me.

1660-07-30 10:30   Sat at our office to-day, and my father came this day the first time to see us at my new office.

1660-07-29 17:50   Finding my Lord at home I got him to look over my accounts, which he did approve of and signed them, and so we are even to this day.

1660-07-29 16:40   With Dick Vines and his brother Payton, we walked to Lisson Green and Marybone and back again.

1660-07-29 11:20   To White Hall Chappell, where I heard a cold sermon of the Bishop of Salisbury’s. The ceremonies did not please me, they do so overdo them.

1660-07-28 16:30   So many lies I never heard in praise of anything as Mr. Butler told of Ireland.

1660-07-28 15:50   I went with Mr. Henson to the Swan Tavern and sent for Mr. Butler, who was now all full of his high discourse in praise of Ireland.

1660-07-28 14:40   Meeting with Mr. Henson, who had formerly had the brave clock that went with bullets (which is now taken away from him by the King).

1660-07-28 06:00   A boy brought me a letter from Poet Fisher, who tells me that he is upon a panegyrique of the King, and desired to borrow a piece of me.

1660-07-27 19:30   Will, my clerk, and I were all the afternoon making up my accounts, and I find myself worth about 100l. after all my expenses.

1660-07-26 22:00   Meeting with W. Symons and his wife, and Luellin, and D. Scobell’s wife, we went to Wood’s at the Pell Mell (our old house for clubbing).

1660-07-26 16:10   I was told how Baron against all expectation and law has got the place of Bickerstaffe.

1660-07-26 15:30   I met Dr. Castle, who is one of the Clerks of the Privy Seal, and told him how things were with my Lord and me, which he received gladly.

1660-07-26 11:20   My Lord's patent is done, which he presented upon his knees to the Speaker; and so it was read in the House, and he took his place.

1660-07-26 10:15   Thinking to have a meeting, but my Lord could not, it being the day that he was to go and be admitted in the House of Lords.

1660-07-25 21:40   Very late home and called in Tower Street, and there at a barber’s was trimmed the first time.

1660-07-25 11:40   My Lord took leave of the House of Commons, and had the thanks of the House for his great services to his country.

1660-07-25 10:30   I met with Mr. Creed, and with him and a Welsh schoolmaster, a good scholar but a very pedagogue, to the ordinary at the Leg in King Street.

1660-07-24 09:55   Mr. Watkins did offer me a kinsman of his to be my clerk, which I did give him some hope of, though I never intend it.

1660-07-24 09:40   To White Hall, where I did acquaint Mr. Watkins with my being sworn into the Privy Seal, at which he was much troubled.

1660-07-23 18:10   My Lord had heard that Mr. Barnwell was dead, but it is not so yet, though he be very ill.

1660-07-23 14:30   We took the Oath of the Privy Seal, of which I was much glad, though I am not likely to get anything by it at present; but I do desire it.

1660-07-23 14:15   My Lord took me to Secretary Nicholas, and there my Lord and I upon our knees together took our oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy.

1660-07-23 10:00   Mr. Barlow and I went forth to a scrivener in Fenchurch Street, whom we found sick of the gout in bed, and sealed our agreement before him.

1660-07-22 22:00   Home, and had a chapter read; and I read prayers out of the Common Prayer Book, the first time that ever I read prayers in this house.

1660-07-22 16:05   One man was basted by the keeper, for carrying some people over on his back through the water.

1660-07-22 15:50   I left my Lord and went to walk in the Park, where great endeavouring to get into the inward Park, but could not get in.

1660-07-22 15:00   To White Hall, where I find my Lord at home, and walked in the garden with him, he showing me all the respect that can be.

1660-07-21 23:00   So to my house to write letters and so to Whitehall about business of my Lord’s concerning his creation, and so home and to bed.

1660-07-21 13:50   To the Six Clerks’ office to Mr Spong for the writings. Dined with him at a club at the next door where we had three voices to sing catches.

1660-07-21 10:30   Spoke to my Lord about the business of the Privy Seal for me to be sworn, though I got nothing by it, but to do Mr. Moore a kindness.

1660-07-20 14:10   I did this time show so much coldness to W. Joyce that I believe all the table took notice of it.

1660-07-20 13:15   To my father’s, where all were at dinner at a venison pasty of the venison that I did give my mother the other day.

1660-07-20 11:20   I sent my wife to my father’s and he is to give me 5l. worth of pewter.

1660-07-19 21:50   Great talk of the difference between the Episcopal and Presbyterian Clergy, but I believe it will come to nothing.

1660-07-19 14:00   I took Mr. Michell and his wife to the Dog Tavern, where I did give them a dish of anchovies and olives and paid for all.

1660-07-19 11:20   This day I received my commission to swear people the oath of allegiance and supremacy delivered me by my Lord.

1660-07-19 10:30   I to my Lord and found him in bed.

1660-07-19 09:45   I landed my wife at Whitefriars with her boy with an iron of our new range which is already broke and my wife will have changed.

1660-07-19 09:10   I did lie late a-bed.

1660-07-18 22:30   My mind quiet, only a trouble I have for the debts which I have still upon me to the Secretary, Mr. Kipps, and Mr. Spong for my patent.

1660-07-18 21:10   I had no great mind to go to my mother, because my father did lay upon me continually to do him a kindness at the Wardrobe.

1660-07-18 20:30   In comes one with half a buck from Hinchinbroke, and it smelling strong my Lord did give it me (though it was as good as any could be).

1660-07-18 15:40   I did meet with Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, with a porter with him, with a barrel of Lemons, which my man Burr sends me from sea.

1660-07-17 23:10   I to bed the first night that I ever lay here with my wife.

1660-07-17 22:30   I found my wife in bed and Jane washing the house, and Will the boy sleeping, and a great deal of sport I had before I could wake him.

1660-07-17 21:20   Will, Mr. Blackburne’s nephew, is so obedient, that I am greatly glad of him.

1660-07-17 20:40   I sent my wife and Mrs. Hunt to buy something for supper; they bought a Quarter of Lamb, and so we ate it, but it was not half roasted.

1660-07-17 16:20   I got all my goods packed up and sent away, and my wife and I and Mrs. Hunt went by coach, overtaking the carts a-drinking in the Strand.

1660-07-17 09:00   There came to my house before I went out Mr. Barlow, an old consumptive man, and fair conditioned, with whom I did discourse a great while.

1660-07-16 13:00   This morning it proved very rainy weather so that I could not remove my goods to my house.

1660-07-15 21:40   My patent has cost me a great deal of money, about 40l., which is the only thing at present which do trouble me much.

1660-07-15 21:20   My wife and I mightily pleased with our new house that we hope to have.

1660-07-15 20:50   My wife at home all the day, she having no clothes out, all being packed up yesterday.

1660-07-15 20:30   I fell into discourse of buying paper at the first hand in my office, and Captain Stokes promised me to buy it for me in France.

1660-07-15 15:30   To Henry the Seventh’s chapel, where I heard a sermon and spent (God forgive me) most of my time in looking upon Mrs. Butler.

1660-07-15 13:40   I find my Lord to be a sceptic in all things of religion, and to make no great matter of anything therein, but to be a perfect Stoic.

1660-07-15 11:30   To Westminster Abbey, and in Henry the Seventh’s Chappell heard part of a sermon, the first that ever I heard there.

1660-07-15 09:20   Lay long in bed to recover my rest.

1660-07-14 22:30   So home, where I found my wife had packed up all her goods in the house fit for a removal. So to bed.

1660-07-14 17:20   Into Fenchurch Street, and did give Mr. Butler a glass of wine at Rawlinson’s, and was trimmed in the street.

1660-07-14 16:30   I took Mr. Butler with me into London by coach and shewed him my house at the Navy Office.

1660-07-14 13:50   To the Leg in King Street and Mr. Eglin gave me a dish of meat to dinner; I sent for Mons. L’Impertinent, where we sat long and were merry.

1660-07-14 11:30   To Westminster Hall, where I paid all my debts in order to my going away from hence.

1660-07-14 10:50   So to my Lord’s, where I staid doing his business and taking his commands.

1660-07-14 09:40   With Major Tollhurst and others to Harper’s, and I sent for my barrel of pickled oysters and there ate them.

1660-07-14 06:10   Up early and advised with my wife for the putting of all our things in a readiness to be sent to our new house.

1660-07-13 21:15   Here at the old door that did go into Whally's lodgings, my Lord, I, and W. Howe, did stand listening a great while to the music.

1660-07-13 20:40   The King and Dukes at the next house with Madame Palmer, a pretty woman that they have a fancy to, to make her husband a cuckold.

1660-07-13 16:30   So to the Navy office, and showed her my house, and were both mightily pleased at all things there, and so to my business.

1660-07-13 16:10   Went to my wife again, whom I had left in a coach at the door of Hinde Court, and presented her with my patent at which she was overjoyed.

1660-07-13 15:50   Went home and brought my wife with me into London, and some money, with which I paid Mr. Beale 9l. in all, and took my patent of him.

1660-07-13 14:40   To Worcester House, where by Mr. Kipps’s means, and my pressing in General Montagu’s name to the Chancellor, I did get my seal passed.

1660-07-13 13:40   Much troubled in mind about my patent, I went to Mr. Beale again, who had now finished my patent and made it ready for the Seal.

1660-07-13 10:30   Mr Beale to be preparing my dockett. Being done, I did give him two pieces, after which it was strange how civil and tractable he was to me.

1660-07-13 09:50   By much importunity I got Mr. Spong to go to his office and make an end of my patent.

1660-07-13 09:10   We carried it to Mr. Beale for a dockett; but he was very angry, and unwilling to do it, because he said it was ill writ.

1660-07-13 08:30   We carried my patent to Worcester House to the Chancellor, where Mr. Kipps, got me the Chancellor’s recepi to my bill.

1660-07-13 08:00   To Mr. Spong, whom I found in his night-down writing of my patent, and he had done as far as he could “for that &c.” by 8 o’clock.

1660-07-13 06:00   Up early, the first day that I put on my black camlett coat with silver buttons.

1660-07-12 23:30   In great trouble because I heard at Mr. Beale’s to-day that Barlow had been there and said that he would make a stop in the business.

1660-07-12 23:00   I got Mr. Spong to take my bill to write it himself (which was a great providence that he could do it) against to-morrow morning.

1660-07-12 10:50   In a despair went to the Admiralty, where we met the first time, my Lord Montagu, all the rest of the principal Officers and Commissioners.

1660-07-12 10:25   I could find none that could write the hand, that were at leisure.

1660-07-12 10:10   Mr. Beale not having time to get it done in Chancery-hand, I was forced to run all up and down Chancery-lane, and the Six Clerks’ Office.

1660-07-12 09:20   To the House of Lords, and met with Mr. Kipps, who directed me to Mr. Beale to get my patent engrossed.

1660-07-12 08:50   By coach to White Hall with Commissioner Pett, where, after we had talked with my Lord, I went to the Privy Seal and got my bill perfected.

1660-07-11 17:20   To White Hall, and took out my bill signed by the King, and carried it to Mr. Watkins of the Privy Seal to be despatched there.

1660-07-11 16:30   I was vexed to see a busy fellow come to look out the best lodgings for my Lord Barkley, and the combining between him and Sir W. Pen.

1660-07-11 14:10   Went all to dinner to the Dolphin, upon Major Brown’s invitation.

1660-07-11 10:40   With Sir W. Pen by water to the Navy office, where we met, and dispatched business.

1660-07-10 20:40   Home, with my mind pretty quiet: not returning, as I said I would, to see the bride put to bed.

1660-07-10 18:10   I got my Lord to go to the Secretary’s, which he did, and desired the dispatch of his and my bills to be signed by the King.

1660-07-10 12:10   Among all the beauties there, my wife was thought the greatest.

1660-07-10 11:40   Took my wife to a wedding of Nan Hartlib to Mynheer Roder, which was kept at Goring House with very great state, cost, and noble company.

1660-07-10 07:10   This day I put on first my new silk suit, the first that ever I wore in my life.

1660-07-09 19:10   Captain Holland and Mr. Browne of Harwich took me to a tavern and did give me a collation.

1660-07-09 14:30   To the Navy office, where we met and sat, and there I begun to sign bills in the Office the first time.

1660-07-08 21:30   Mr. Fairebrother told me how he had perfectly procured me to be made Master in Arts by proxy, which did somewhat please me.

1660-07-08 11:40   The Bishop of Chichester preached before the King a flattering sermon, which I did not like that Clergy should meddle with matters of state.

1660-07-08 11:10   To White Hall chapel. I heard very good music, the first time that ever I remember to have heard the organs and singing-men in surplices.

1660-07-07 16:10   To the Navy Office, where I began to take an inventory of the papers, and goods, and books of the office.

1660-07-07 11:30   To the Change, where I bought two fine prints of Ragotts from Rubens, and afterwards dined with my Uncle and Aunt Wight.

1660-07-07 09:50   I took an order for the advance of the salaries of the officers of the Navy, and I find mine to be raised to 350l. per annum.

1660-07-06 22:20   In the dark W. Howe and I did sing extemporys, and I find by use that we are able to sing a bass and a treble pretty well.

1660-07-06 20:10   Mr. Pim took me to the Half Moon, and the house so full that we staid above half an hour before we could get anything.

1660-07-06 19:20   Called at Mr. Pim’s, about getting me a coat of velvet.

1660-07-06 16:30   Sir Geoffry Palmer, who did give me advice about my patent, which put me to some doubt to know what to do, Barlow being alive.

1660-07-06 15:10   My Lord and I, and Mr. Coventry and Sir G. Carteret, took possession of the Navy Office, whereby my mind was cheered but my hopes not great.

1660-07-06 13:30   To my Lord’s and dined with W. Howe and Sarah, thinking it might be the last time that I might dine with them together.

1660-07-06 09:50   With my Lord at Whitehall, got the order of the Council for us to act.

1660-07-05 22:10   Comes Dr. Petty to me, to tell me that Barlow had come to town, and other things, which put me into a despair, and I went to bed very sad.

1660-07-05 14:20   Mr. Cooling told me how he had a project for all us Secretaries to join together, and get money by bringing all business into our hands.

1660-07-05 13:40   Met with Mr. Cooling, who took me to dinner among the gentlemen waiters, and after dinner into the wine-cellar.

1660-07-05 11:50   I was forced to walk all the morning in White Hall, not knowing how to get out because of the rain.

1660-07-05 11:30   I saw the King, the Dukes, and all their attendants go forth in the rain to the City, and it bedraggled many a fine suit of clothes.

1660-07-05 10:50   Mr. Hater was with me to-day, and I agreed with him to be my clerk.

1660-07-05 10:20   It rained, which makes us fear that the glory of this great day will be lost; the King and Parliament being to be entertained by the City.

1660-07-05 08:40   My brother Tom brought me my jackanapes coat with silver buttons.

1660-07-04 20:50   My Lord told me how my orders that I drew about giving us power to act, are granted by the Council. At which he and I were very glad.

1660-07-04 17:20   It was strange to see how all the people flocked together bare, to see the King looking out of the Council window.

1660-07-04 16:00   I took M. L’Impertinent and W. Bowyer to the Sun Tavern, and gave them a lobster and some wine, and sat talking like a fool.

1660-07-04 10:20   To view the houses in Seething Lane, where I find the worst very good, and had great fears in my mind that they will shuffle me out of them.

1660-07-04 08:10   I went to the Treasurer’s of the Navy, with whom I spake about the business of my office, who put me into very good hopes of my business.

1660-07-04 02:00   Till 2 in the morning writing letters and things for my Lord to send to sea.

1660-07-03 15:50   Dr. Petty did tell my Lord that Barlow was a sickly man, and did not intend to execute the place himself, which put me in comfort again.

1660-07-03 15:10   My heart was quite pulled down, by being told that Mr. Barlow was to enquire to-day for Mr. Coventry.

1660-07-03 14:00   Dined with Mr. Turner, to whom I offered 50l. out of my own purse, which he thanked me for; but I find he hath some design yet in his head.

1660-07-03 10:20   The Officers and Commissioners of the Navy, we met and agreed upon orders for the Council to supersede the old ones, and empower us to act.

1660-07-02 21:30   Supped with my Lord, he and I together, in the great dining-room alone by ourselves, the first time I ever did it in London.

1660-07-02 19:15   We had order to draw up such an order of the Council as would put us into action before our patents were passed. At which my heart was glad.

1660-07-02 19:00   My Lord went home, and there the principal Officers of the Navy, among the rest myself was reckoned one.

1660-07-02 17:10   All the afternoon with my Lord, going up and down the town.

1660-07-02 13:50   Met with Washington, with whom I dined at the Bell Tavern, but the rogue had no more manners than to invite me and to let me pay my club.

1660-07-02 11:40   Infinite of business that my heart and head and all were full.

1660-07-01 22:40   To my Lord’s, where late at night comes Mr. Morland, whom I left prating with my Lord, and so home.

1660-07-01 16:40   I saw Mynheer Roder, that is to marry Sam Hartlib’s sister, a great fortune for her to light on, she being worth nothing in the world.

1660-07-01 15:10   To the Abbey, where a good sermon by a stranger, but no Common Prayer yet.

1660-07-01 13:30   I went to the cook’s and got a good joint of meat, and my wife and I dined at home alone.

1660-07-01 09:20   Came home my fine Camlett cloak, with gold buttons, and a silk suit, which cost me much money, and I pray God to make me able to pay for it.
