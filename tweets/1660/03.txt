1660-03-30 16:10 My Lord and many others went on board the Nazeby, where every thing was out of order, and a new chimney made for my Lord in his bedchamber.

1660-03-30 13:45 While my Lord and we were at dinner, the Nazeby came in sight towards us, and at last came to anchor close by us.

1660-03-29 18:50 A whispering of some of the Vice-Admiral’s captains that they were dissatisfied, and did intend to fight themselves, to oppose the General.

1660-03-28 17:50 This morning and the whole day busy, and that the more because Mr. Burr was about his own business all the day at Gravesend.

1660-03-27 16:00 Sir H. Wright came onboard us about his business of being chosen Parliament-man. My Lord brought him to my cabin, when I was hard a-writing.

1660-03-27 10:10 Passing by the Vice-Admiral, the frigates did give us abundance of guns and we them, so much that the report broke the windows in my cabin.

1660-03-26 22:10 Mr. Sheply and W. Howe brought some wine and things to eat in my cabin, where we were merry, remembering the day of being cut for the stone.

1660-03-26 17:40 All the afternoon very many orders were made, till I was very weary.

1660-03-26 10:20 I rose early, and went about making of an establishment of the whole Fleet, and a list of all the ships, with the number of men and guns.

1660-03-26 07:00 Within my soul I can and do rejoice, and bless God, being at this time blessed be his holy name, in as good health as ever I was in my life.

1660-03-26 06:45 This day it is two years since it pleased God that I was cut of the stone at Mrs. Turner’s in Salisbury Court.

1660-03-25 07:10 There was a letter from Mr. Blackburne, who with his own hand superscribes it to S.P. Esq., of which God knows I was not a little proud.

1660-03-25 02:00 Letters came from London by our coxon, so they waked me, but I would not rise but bid him stay till morning.

1660-03-24 22:30 This day Mr. Creed came on board and dined very boldly with my Lord, but he could not get a bed there.

1660-03-24 22:10 At work hard all the day writing letters to the Council, &c.

1660-03-24 15:40 The boy Eliezer flung down a can of beer upon my papers which made me give him a box of the ear, it having all spoiled my papers.

1660-03-24 06:10 I slept very well, and the weather being good I was not sick at all, yet I know not when I shall be.

1660-03-23 20:50 We were late writing of orders for the getting of ships ready, &c.; and making of others to all the seaports between Hastings and Yarmouth.

1660-03-23 14:45 I to the cabin allotted for me, which was the best that any had that belonged to my Lord.

1660-03-23 13:15 Soon as my Lord on board, the guns went off bravely from the ships. 

1660-03-23 13:00 We saw the great breach which the late high water had made, to the loss of many 1000l. to the people about Limehouse.

1660-03-22 17:00 Took leave of Kate Sterpin who was very sorry to part with me.

1660-03-22 15:15 I pray God to keep me from being proud or too much lifted up.

1660-03-22 15:00 People now promise me anything; one a rapier, the other a vessel of wine or a gun. One offered me his silver hatband to do him a courtesy.

1660-03-22 12:30 I went forth about my own business to buy a pair of riding grey serge stockings and sword and belt and hose.

1660-03-22 09:10 The weather continuing very bad my Lord would not go to-day.

1660-03-21 14:00 To a tavern over against Mr. Pierce’s with judge Advocate Fowler and Mr. Burr, and sat and drank with them two or three pints of wine.

1660-03-21 08:10 To my Lord’s, but the wind very high against us, and the weather bad we could not go to-day.

1660-03-20 19:00 By reason of rain and an easterly wind, the water was so high that there was boats rowed in King Street and all our yard was drowned.

1660-03-20 15:40 Hither comes Pim’s boy, with two monteeres for me to take my choice of, and I chose the saddest colour and left the other for Mr. Sheply.

1660-03-20 15:10 W. Simons comes to us and I gave them my foy against my going to sea; and so we took leave one of another, they promising me to write to me.

1660-03-20 09:40 My Lord giving me all letters and papers that come to him about business, for me to give him account of when we come on shipboard.

1660-03-20 08:30 This morning I rose early and went to my house to put things in a little order against my going, which I conceive will be to-morrow.

1660-03-19 21:00 This day my Lord dined at my Lord Mayor’s, and Jasper was made drunk, which my Lord was very angry at.

1660-03-19 20:15 My mind is still much troubled for my poor wife, but I hope that this undertaking will be worth my pains.

1660-03-19 18:50 The discourse now-a-day is that the King will come again; and for all I see, it is the wishes of all; and all do believe that it will be so.

1660-03-19 14:40 With some sea officers to the Swan, where we drank wine till one comes to me to pay me some money from Worcester, viz., 25l.

1660-03-19 11:00 Mr. Blackburne told me that it was much to be feared that the King would come in, for all good men and good things were now discouraged.

1660-03-19 07:20 Early to my Lord, where infinity of business to do, which makes my head full.

1660-03-18 22:10 To Mrs. Crisp, where we sat talking, I giving them the best advice that I could concerning their son, how he should go to sea.

1660-03-17 19:30 I went home with Mr. Crips to his mother’s house by me in Axe Yard, where I found Dr. Clodius’s wife and sat there talking.

1660-03-17 14:30 After dinner to my own house, where all things were put up into the dining-room and locked up, and my wife took the keys along with her.

1660-03-17 11:25 I did seal my will to my wife, whereby I did give her all that I have in the world, but my books which I give to my brother John.

1660-03-17 11:10 Took my wife by coach to the Chequer in Holborn, where, after we had drank, &c., she took coach and so farewell.

1660-03-17 09:40 I had much business with my Lord, and papers, great store, given me by my Lord to dispose of as of the rest.

1660-03-17 08:00 We rose and I gave my wife some money to serve her for a time, and what papers of consequence I had.

1660-03-17 07:20 Bade adieu in bed to the company of my wife.

1660-03-16 22:30 From the Hall I went home to bed, very sad in mind to part with my wife, but God’s will be done.

1660-03-16 21:00 Yesterday, one came with a ladder to the Great Exchange, and wiped with a brush the inscription that was upon King Charles.

1660-03-16 20:45 The whole Hall was joyful thereat, as well as themselves, and now they begin to talk loud of the King.

1660-03-16 20:30 To Westminster Hall, where I heard how the Parliament had this day dissolved themselves, and did pass very cheerfully through the Hall.

1660-03-16 07:15 No sooner out of bed but troubled with abundance of clients, seamen.

1660-03-15 22:00 I went to Westminster Hall, and the Parliament sat till ten at night, being expected to dissolve themselves to-day, but they did not. 

1660-03-15 14:25 I did promise to give my wife all that I have in the world but my books, in case I should die at sea.

1660-03-15 14:10 Into London by water, and in Fish Street my wife and I bought a bit of salmon for 8d. and went to the Sun Tavern and ate it.

1660-03-15 11:30 Packing up my things to be sent by cart with the rest of my Lord’s. So to Will’s, where I took leave of some of my friends.

1660-03-14 22:30 By coach to Mrs. Jem, where I staid a while, and so home, and put up my things in a sea-chest that Mr. Sheply lent me, and so to bed.

1660-03-14 16:50 Went to the Admiralty, where a strange thing how I am already courted by the people.

1660-03-14 14:15 Coming home telling my wife what we had to dinner, she had a mind to some cabbage, and I sent for some and she had it.

1660-03-14 12:10 I saw General Monk and methought he seemed a dull heavy man.

1660-03-14 10:40 Among others that came to me I hired a boy of Jenkins of Westminster and Burr to be my clerk.

1660-03-13 19:40 Things seem doubtful what will be the end of all; for the Parliament seems to be strong for the King while the soldiers do all talk against.

1660-03-13 08:20 My Lord told me that I was to be secretary and Creed to be deputy treasurer to the Fleet, at which I was troubled, but I could not help it.

1660-03-12 21:50 I took a thing for my cold, namely a spoonful of honey and a nutmeg scraped into it, and so took it into my mouth.

1660-03-12 10:30 I left my wife at the Exchange and at Bedells the bookseller’s at the Temple gate I paid 12l. 10s. 6d. for Mr. Fuller by his direction.

1660-03-12 07:20 The wench rose at two in the morning to wash, and my wife and I lay talking a while. I by reason of my cold could not tell how to sleep.

1660-03-11 22:20 After supper home, where the wench had provided all things against tomorrow to wash, and so to bed, where I much troubled with my coughing.

1660-03-11 17:10 All the day busy without my band on, putting up my books and things, in order to my going to sea. 

1660-03-10 23:10 My wife was late making of caps for me, and the wench making an end of a pair of stockings that she was knitting of.

1660-03-10 19:40 W. Howe went with me to my office, whither also Mr. Madge comes half foxed and played the fool upon the violin that made me weary. 

1660-03-10 16:10 I took occasion to tell my wife of my going to sea, who was troubled at it and was at last willing to continue at Mr Bowyer’s in my absence.

1660-03-10 11:45 To the Treasurer of the Navy, where I received 500l. for my Lord, and having left 200l. of it with Mr. Rawlinson, I went to the Sun tavern.

1660-03-10 09:00 I told my father my resolution to go to sea and consulted with him how to dispose of my wife. We resolved of letting her be at Mr. Bowyer’s.

1660-03-10 06:45 Being overheated with drink I made a promise to drink no strong drink this week for I find it makes me sweat and puts me quite out of order.

1660-03-10 06:30 All night troubled in my thoughts how to order my business upon this great change with me that I could not sleep.

1660-03-09 22:10 Mr. Butler and I to Harper’s, where we sat and drank for two hours; the old woman she was drunk and began to talk foolishly.

1660-03-09 11:30 In the Painted Chamber walked a good while; I telling my Lord that I was willing and ready to go with him to sea, he agreed that I should,

1660-03-08 18:00 Officers of the Army, and some of the Parliament, had a conference at White Hall to make all right again, but I know not what is done.

1660-03-08 15:40 Home about two o’clock, and took my wife by land to Paternoster Row, to buy some Paragon for a petticoat and so home again.

1660-03-08 09:40 There was a general damp over men’s minds and faces upon the Officers of the Army being about making a remonstrance against Charles Stuart.

1660-03-07 17:50 My father left my uncle with his leg very dangerous, and do believe he cannot continue in that condition long.

1660-03-07 17:30 My uncle Wight and I homewards, parted at Fleet Street, where I found my father newly come home from Brampton very well. 

1660-03-07 15:50 I went to the Pope’s Head Alley and called on Adam Chard, and bought a catcall there, it cost me two groats.

1660-03-07 13:20 By appointment to the Angel, where Chetwind, Mr. Thomas and Doling were at oysters, and beginning Lent this day with a fish dinner.

1660-03-07 10:30 My Lord offered all the ways that could be, how he might do me good, with the greatest liberty and love that could be.

1660-03-07 09:15 I met with Mr. Lynes, the surgeon, who promised me some seeds of the sensitive plant.

1660-03-06 22:00 My mind, I must needs remember, has been very much eased and joyed at my Lord’s great expressions of kindness this day.

1660-03-06 20:55 Every body now drinks the King’s health without any fear, whereas before it was very private that a man dare do it.

1660-03-06 20:40 My Lord told me that he did believe it would not last long if the Protector were brought in; no, nor the King neither.

1660-03-06 17:00 The ladies went into the dining-room, where it was full of tag, rag, and bobtail, dancing, singing, and drinking, of which I was ashamed.

1660-03-06 14:10 I played upon a viall, and Mr. Tanner a viallin, and were very merry, with a special good dinner, with abundance of wine. 

1660-03-06 09:45 My Lord asked me whether I could, without too much inconvenience, go to sea as his secretary, and bid me think of it.

1660-03-06 09:30 My Lord bade me look out now some good place, and he would use all his own, and all the interest of his friends, to do me good.

1660-03-05 19:50 Mr. Hunt told me how the Parliament had voted that the Covenant be printed and hung in churches again.

1660-03-04 11:30 Before I went to church I sang Orpheus’ Hymn to my viall. After that to Mr. Gunning’s, an excellent sermon upon charity.

1660-03-03 20:15 Tom Harper talked huge high that my Lord Protector would come in place again, which is much discoursed of, though I do not see it possible.

1660-03-03 20:00 Tom Harper took me to a place in Drury Lane where we drank a great deal of strong water, more than ever I did in my life at one time before.

1660-03-03 17:15 I hear this day from many that things are in a very doubtful posture, some of the Parliament being willing to keep the power in their hands.

1660-03-03 16:30 Went by appointment to Hering, the merchant, but missed of my money, at which I was much troubled, but could not help myself. 

1660-03-03 15:51 My Lord told me he feared there was new design hatching, as if Monk had a mind to get into the saddle.

1660-03-03 15:40 By coach with my Lord, in our way talking of publick things, and how I should look after getting of his Commissioner’s despatch.

1660-03-03 13:00 My brother Tom came and dined with me, and told me that my mother was not very well, and that my Aunt Fenner was very ill too.

1660-03-03 12:10 Up to my office, but did nothing. At noon home to dinner to a sheep’s head.

1660-03-02 22:15 Spent the evening in my study, and so after some talk with my wife, then to bed.

1660-03-02 17:30 Great is the talk of a single person, and that it would now be Charles, George, or Richard again.

1660-03-02 17:10 To Westminster Hall, where I saw Sir G. Booth at liberty.

1660-03-02 15:40 To the Swan tavern, where we drank a quart or two of wine, and so parted.

1660-03-01 20:30 To Westminster, where at the Sun Mr. Sheply and I spent two or three hours in a pint or two of wine, discoursing of matters in the country.

1660-03-01 14:45 Mr. Crew’s coachman was to be buried, he being a day before killed with a blow of one of his horses that struck his skull into his brain.

1660-03-01 13:15 To Mr. Crew’s whither Mr. Thomas was newly come to town, to bring the thanks of the county to General Monk for the return of the Parliament.

1660-03-01 09:30 Mr. Sheply being not within I went up. Out of the box where my Lord’s pamphlets lay, I chose as many as I had a mind to have for my own use.

1660-03-01 09:10 I went to my Lord’s lodgings, thinking to have spoke with Mr. Sheply, having not been to visit him since my coming to town.
