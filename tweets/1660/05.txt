1660-05-31 21:40 I find myself in all things well as to body and mind, but troubled for the absence of my wife.

1660-05-31 21:10 This day the month ends, I in very good health, and all the world in a merry mood because of the King’s coming.

1660-05-31 18:30 My pain was gone again that I had yesterday, blessed be God.

1660-05-31 16:40 Captain Sparling of the Assistance brought me a pair of silk stockings of a light blue, which I was much pleased with.

1660-05-31 15:10 A while below trying with W. Howe some of Mr. Laws’ songs, particularly that of “What is a kiss” with which we had a great deal of pleasure.

1660-05-30 20:40 All yesterday and to-day I had a great deal of pain… and in my back, which made me afeard. But it proved nothing but cold.

1660-05-30 12:10 All this morning making up my accounts, in which I had made myself now worth about 80l., at which my heart was glad, and blessed God.

1660-05-30 07:55 The lieutenant came to me to know whether I would eat a dish of mackerel, for my breakfast, which the Captain and we did in the coach.

1660-05-29 19:30 This day, it is thought, the King do enter the city of London.

1660-05-29 18:00 The pain that I have got last night by cold is not yet gone, but troubles me at the time of…

1660-05-29 16:15 While we were on the top of the cliffe, we saw and heard our guns in the fleet go off for the same joy.

1660-05-29 16:00 We found the people at Deal going to make a bonfire, it being the King’s birthday, and had guns which they did fire at my Lord’s coming by.

1660-05-29 15:20 My Lord showed me a house that cost a great deal of money, and is built in so inconvenient a place that my Lord calls it the fool’s house.

1660-05-29 15:00 On shore we took horses, my Lord and Mr. Edward, Mr. Hetly and I, and three or four servants, and had a great deal of pleasure in riding.

1660-05-29 13:20 After dinner got all ready and sent away Mr. Cook to London with a letter and token to my wife.

1660-05-29 06:30 I had a strange dream of … myself, which I did, and having kicked my clothes off, I got cold; and found myself all much wet in the morning.

1660-05-28 16:40 A great part of the afternoon at nine-pins with my Lord and Mr. Hetley. I lost about 4s.

1660-05-28 11:50 I received in the Captain’s cabin, for my share, sixty ducats. The rest of the morning busy writing letters.

1660-05-28 08:00 The Captain did call over all the men in the ship, and give every one of them a ducat of the King’s money that he gave the ship.

1660-05-28 05:10 Called up at two in the morning for letters for my Lord from the Duke of York, but I went to bed again till 5.

1660-05-27 13:30 I dined in my cabin, where Mr. Drum brought me a lobster and a bottle of oil, instead of a bottle of vinegar, whereby I spoiled my dinner.

1660-05-27 10:00 Mr. Thos. Crew and Mr. J. Pickering (who had staid long enough to make all the world see him to be a fool), took ship for London.

1660-05-27 08:20 The herald putting the ribbon about my Lord's neck, and the Garter about his left leg, he salutes him with joy as Knight of the Garter.

1660-05-27 07:10 Called up by John Goods to see the Garter and Heralds coat, brought by Sir Edward Walker, King at Arms, this morning, for my Lord.

1660-05-26 22:00 To bed.

1660-05-26 21:20 My Lord has appointed me 30l. out of the 1000 ducats which the King had given to the ship, at which my heart is very much joyed.

1660-05-26 19:40 My Lord having been a-shore, the first time that he hath been a-shore since he came out of the Hope, returned with a great deal of pleasure.

1660-05-26 17:30 Mr. North and Dr. Clerke and all the great company being gone, I found myself very uncouth all this day for want thereof.

1660-05-26 17:10 After a game or two at nine-pins, to work all the afternoon, making above twenty orders.

1660-05-26 12:45 The Vice-Admiral is as officious, poor man! as any spaniel can be; but I believe all to no purpose for I believe he will not hold his place.

1660-05-26 09:10 Thanks to God I got to bed in my own poor cabin, and slept well till 9 o’clock this morning.

1660-05-25 19:30 My Lord did give me order to cause a Crown and C. R. to be made at the head of the coach table, where the King did mark his height.

1660-05-25 15:30 The shouting and joy expressed by all is past imagination.

1660-05-25 15:15 And so into a stately coach there set for the King, and so away through the town towards Canterbury, without making any stay at Dover.

1660-05-25 14:40 The Mayor presented the King from the town a very rich Bible, which he said it was the thing that he loved above all things in the world.

1660-05-25 14:10 We got on shore when the King did, who was received by Gen Monk with all imaginable love and respect at his entrance upon the land of Dover.

1660-05-25 09:40 Great expectation of the King’s making some Knights, but there was none.

1660-05-25 09:20 I spoke with the Duke of York about business, who called me Pepys by name, and upon my desire did promise me his future favour.

1660-05-25 08:10 The King and the Dukes did eat their breakfast, and there being set some ship’s diet before them, they eat of pease, pork, and boiled beef.

1660-05-25 07:00 By the morning we were come close to the land, and every body made ready to get on shore.

1660-05-24 22:10 To bed, coming in sight of land a little before night.

1660-05-24 19:50 Dr. Scarborough said that children do, in every day’s experience, look several ways with both their eyes till custom teaches them otherwise.

1660-05-24 16:50 Walking upon the decks, where persons of honour all the afternoon, among others, Thomas Killigrew, who told us many merry stories.

1660-05-24 13:40 There dined with me Dr. Earle, Mr. Hollis, Dr. Scarborough, Dr. Quarterman, Dr. Clerke, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Fox, where we had brave discourse.

1660-05-24 06:50 Up, and made myself as fine as I could, with the Linning stockings on and wide canons that I bought the other day at Hague.

1660-05-23 17:30 The King fell into discourse of his escape from Worcester. It made me ready to weep to hear the stories that he told of his difficulties.

1660-05-23 17:10 All the afternoon the King walked here and there, up and down (quite contrary to what I thought him to have been), very active and stirring.

1660-05-23 14:50 we weighed anchor, and with a fresh gale and most happy weather we set sail for England.

1660-05-23 14:30 After dinner the King and Duke altered the name of some of the ships.

1660-05-23 13:10 Dined in a great deal of state, the Royall company by themselves in the coach, which was a blessed sight to see.

1660-05-23 10:20 Infinite shooting off of the guns, and that in a disorder on purpose, which was better than if it had been otherwise.

1660-05-23 10:05 The King, with the two Dukes and Queen of Bohemia, Princess Royal, and Prince of Orange, came on board.

1660-05-23 09:50 I hear that His Majesty did with a great deal of affection kiss my Lord upon his first meeting.

1660-05-23 09:30 In the morning came infinity of people on board from the King to go along with him.

1660-05-23 07:10 The Doctor and I waked very merry, only my eye was very red and ill in the morning from yesterday’s hurt.

1660-05-22 15:31 The gun over against my cabin I fired myself to the King; but holding my head too much over the gun, I had almost spoiled my right eye.

1660-05-22 15:20 News is sent that the King is on shore; my Lord fired all his guns, all the fleet after him, which fell into disorder which seemed handsome.

1660-05-22 08:45 As the Dukes were entered we shot the guns off. After that they went to view the ship all over, and were most exceedingly pleased with it.

1660-05-22 08:30 The two Dukes came on board, the Duke of York in yellow trimmings, the Duke of Gloucester in grey and red.

1660-05-22 05:30 Up very early, and now beginning to be settled in my wits again, I went about setting down my last four days’ observations this morning.

1660-05-21 19:10 I understand that the Parliament had ordered all persons to be secured in order to a trial, that did sit as judges in the late King’s death.

1660-05-21 17:30 After dinner, about writing one thing or other all day, and setting my papers in order, having been so long absent.

1660-05-21 09:10 Into my naked bed and slept till 9 o’clock, and then John Goods waked me, and the captain’s boy brought me four barrels of Mallows oysters.

1660-05-21 04:10 I lay down in my gown upon my bed and slept till the 4 o’clock gun the next morning waked me and mistook the sun rising for the sun setting.

1660-05-20 14:10 Through badness of weather we were in great danger, so that of all the company not one but myself that was not sick.

1660-05-20 12:20 Commissioner Pett at last came to our lodging, and caused the boats to go off; so we all bid adieu to the shore.

1660-05-20 08:10 I went into the church at Scheveling, which was pretty handsome, and in the chancel a very great upper part of the mouth of a whale.

1660-05-20 07:51 I talked to her as much as I could, and took occasion, to kiss her hand, but had not the face to offer anything more.

1660-05-20 07:40 At last she rose, and then I rose and walked up and down the chamber, and saw her dress herself after the Dutch dress.

1660-05-20 06:00 I went to lie down, where in another bed there was a pretty Dutch woman but though I had a month’s-mind I had not the boldness to go to her.

1660-05-20 05:20 With Mr. Pickering and the child by waggon to Scheveling.

1660-05-19 20:10 To a Dutch house where there was an exceeding pretty lass, right for the sport, but it being Saturday we could not have much of her company.

1660-05-19 17:20 To the Hague again playing at crambo in the waggon, Mr. Edward, Mr. Ibbott, W. Howe, Mr. Pinkney, and I.

1660-05-19 16:40 We went into a little drinking house where there were a great many Dutch boors eating of fish in a boorish manner, but merry in their way.

1660-05-19 09:50 Another pretty piece of painting I saw, on which there was a great wager laid by young Pinkney and me whether it was a principal or a copy.

1660-05-19 09:30 We went to buy some pictures, where I saw a sort of painting done upon woollen cloth, drawn as if there was a curtain over it.

1660-05-19 08:10 To the Hague, in our way lighting and going to see a woman that makes pretty rock-work in shells, &c.

1660-05-18 16:20 There is a fine Echo under the house in a vault made on purpose with pillars, where I played on my flageolette to great advantage.

1660-05-18 15:00 I went along with Commissioner Pett, Mr. Ackworth and Mr. Dawes his friends, to the Princess Dowager’s house again.

1660-05-18 14:00 Back by water, where a pretty sober Dutch lass sat reading all the way, and I could not fasten any discourse upon her.

1660-05-18 11:40 We also saw the Guesthouse where it was very pleasant to see what neat preparation there is for the poor. We saw one poor man a-dying there.

1660-05-18 10:50 Here were very fine organs in both the churches. It is a most sweet town, with bridges, and a river in every street.

1660-05-18 10:20 I saw a tomb of the old Prince of Orange; wherein among other rarities there are the angels with their trumpets expressed as it were crying.

1660-05-18 09:00 A boy showed us the church where Van Trump lies. There is a sea-fight cut in marble, with the smoke, the best expressed that ever I saw.

1660-05-18 08:10 We all took a schuit to Delfe, and very much pleased with the manner and conversation of the passengers, where most speak French.

1660-05-17 19:56 For my life I could not find one lady handsome, but their coaches very rich and themselves so too.

1660-05-17 19:45 Back to the Hague and took a tour or two about the Forehault, where the ladies in the evening do as our ladies do in Hide Park.

1660-05-17 18:40 We to the Echo. In a heaven of pleasure and in a strange country, I never was taken up more with a sense of pleasure in my life.

1660-05-17 18:10 We went to see a house about half-a-mile or a mile from the Hague, where there is the most beautiful room for pictures in the whole world.

1660-05-17 15:45 I and the rest went to see the Queen, who used us very respectfully; her hand we all kissed. She seems a very debonaire, but plain lady.

1660-05-17 15:00 From the King to the Lord Chancellor, who did lie bed-rid of the gout: he spoke very merrily to the child and me.

1660-05-17 14:45 The King seems to be a very sober man; and a very splendid Court he hath in the number of persons of quality that are about him.

1660-05-17 14:31 We kissed the King’s, and the Duke of York’s, and the Princess Royal’s hands.

1660-05-17 14:20 They after dinner got the child and me (the others not being able to crowd in) to see the King, who kissed the child very affectionately.

1660-05-17 11:30 Before dinner Mr. Edw. Pickering and I, W. Howe, Pim, and my boy, to Scheveling, where we took coach, and so to the Hague.

1660-05-17 09:10 Dr. Clerke told me that there was a Portuguese taken yesterday at the Hague, that had a design to kill the King.

1660-05-16 20:40 This evening came Mr. John Pickering on board, like an ass, with his feathers and new suit that he had made at the Hague.

1660-05-16 17:10 My Lord and we at ninepins this afternoon upon the Quarterdeck, which was very pretty sport.

1660-05-16 16:50 Mr. Edwd. Pickering told me in what a sad, poor condition for clothes and money the King was, and all his attendants.

1660-05-16 16:30 Word that the King would come to the shore to look upon the fleet to-day. We had our guns ready to fire, but he did not come.

1660-05-16 12:20 To dinner, where Commissioner Pett was come to take care to get all things ready for the King on board.

1660-05-15 21:20 My Lord sent for me, intending to have me play at cards with him, but I not knowing cribbage, we fell into discourse of many things.

1660-05-15 16:00 My Lord is sceptical, saying that the Protestants as to the Church of Rome are wholly fanatiques: he likes uniformity and form of prayer.

1660-05-15 15:10 My Lord called me to show me his fine cloathes which indeed are rich as gold and silver can make them, only his sword he and I do not like.

1660-05-15 12:50 Mr. Morland was here on board, but I do not find that any body did give him any respect, he being looked upon by all men as a knave.

1660-05-15 12:30 Coming on board we found all the Commissioners of the House of Lords at dinner with my Lord, who after dinner went away for shore.

1660-05-15 11:45 We saw boats overset and the gallants forced to be pulled on shore by the heels, while their trunks, hats, and feathers, were in the sea.

1660-05-15 11:30 The judge, I and my boy by coach to Scheveling again, where we went into a house of entertainment and drank there, the wind being very high.

1660-05-15 09:50 To a bookseller’s and bought for the love of the binding three books: the French Psalms in four parts, Bacon’s Organon, and Farnab. Rhetor.

1660-05-15 08:15 Every body of fashion speaks French or Latin, or both. The women many of them very pretty and in good habits, fashionable and black spots.

1660-05-15 08:00 A schoolmaster that spoke good English and French shewed us the whole town, and indeed I cannot speak enough of the gallantry of the town.

1660-05-15 04:30 We saw the soldiers of the Prince’s guard, all very fine, and the burghers of the town with their arms and muskets as bright as silver.

1660-05-15 03:10 We lay till past three o’clock, then up and down the Hague, to see it by daylight.

1660-05-14 23:50 The Judge and I to another house, and he and I lay in one press bed, there being two more in the same room, but all very neat and handsome.

1660-05-14 23:20 This done we went to a place we had taken to sup in, where a sallet and two or three bones of mutton.

1660-05-14 22:40 The Prince’s attendance very inconsiderable as for a prince; but yet handsome, and his tutor a fine man, and himself a very pretty boy.

1660-05-14 22:05 The Prince comes home, and we found an easy admission.

1660-05-14 19:50 Going to see the Prince, he was gone forth with his governor, and so we walked up and down the town and court to see the place.

1660-05-14 18:40 Here we walked up and down a great while, the town being now very full of Englishmen, for that the Londoners were come on shore today.

1660-05-14 17:25 The Hague is a most neat place in all respects. The houses so neat in all places and things as is possible.

1660-05-14 17:10 I took out my flageolette and piped, but I dropped my rapier-stick, but when I came to the Hague, I sent my boy back for it and he found it.

1660-05-14 16:30 The two ladies very merrily sang all the way and that very well, and were very free to kiss the two blades that were with them.

1660-05-14 16:15 Mr. Creed and I went in the fore part of a coach wherein were two very pretty ladies, very fashionable and with black patches.

1660-05-14 16:00 The shore is, as all the country between that and the Hague, all sand.

1660-05-14 15:10 They were sent again by my Lord to do the same to the Prince of Orange. I got the Captain to ask leave for me to go, which my Lord did give.

1660-05-14 12:45 Mr. North and Dr. Clerke went to kiss the Queen of Bohemia’s hands, from my Lord, with twelve attendants from on board to wait on them.

1660-05-14 11:10 Some gentlemen came on board from the shore to kiss my Lord’s hands.

1660-05-14 10:40 Some masty Dutchmen came on board to proffer their boats to carry things from us on shore, &c., to get money by us.

1660-05-14 08:20 I saw out of the scuttle close by the shore, which afterwards I was told to be the Dutch shore; the Hague was clearly to be seen by us.

1660-05-13 22:40 We writ letters to the King of the news of our coming, and Mr. Edward Pickering carried them.

1660-05-13 18:00 Mr. Cook, bringing me a letter from my wife and a Latin letter from my brother John, with both of which I was exceedingly pleased.

1660-05-13 15:40 A council of war, only to acquaint them that the Harp must be taken out of all their flags, it being very offensive to the King.

1660-05-13 11:30 My Lord liked the flag so well as to bid me give the tailors 20s. among them for doing of it.

1660-05-13 10:20 To the quarter-deck. The tailors and painters were at work, cutting out some pieces of yellow cloth into the fashion of a crown and C. R.

1660-05-13 09:30 Trimmed in the morning, after that to the cook’s room with Mr. Sheply, the first time that I was there this voyage.

1660-05-12 16:10 Upon the quarterdeck the Doctor told Mr. North and me an admirable story called “The Fruitless Precaution,” an exceeding pretty story.

1660-05-12 14:30 at cards with Mr. North and the Doctor.

1660-05-12 10:20 Coming between Dover and Calais, we could see both places, and very pleasant it was that the further we went the more we lost sight of both.

1660-05-12 08:40 The Commissioners are only to come to Dover to attend the coming of the King. So my Lord did give order for weighing anchor, which we did.

1660-05-11 16:20 Overtook us three or four gentlemen; two of the Berties, and one Mr. Dormerhoy, a Scotch gentleman, whom I found to be a very fine man.

1660-05-11 12:30 I had this morning my first opportunity of discoursing with Dr. Clarke, whom I found to be a very pretty man and very knowing.

1660-05-11 11:10 We began to pull down all the State’s arms in the fleet, having first sent to Dover for painters and others to come to set up the King’s.

1660-05-11 08:20 Burr going on shore last night made me angry. But he by and by coming and desiring humbly that I would forgive him I did set him to work.

1660-05-10 20:30 My Lord called me into his cabin, and told me how he was commanded to set sail presently for the King, and was very glad thereof.

1660-05-10 18:10 Mr. Edward Montagu, my Lord’s son, came on board with Mr. Pickering with him. The child was sick in the evening.

1660-05-10 10:10 Came on board Mr. Pinkney and his son, going to the King with a petition finely writ by Mr. Whore, for to be the King’s embroiderer.

1660-05-09 15:50 After dinner to ninepins and lost 5s.

1660-05-09 14:20 Noble brought us certain news that the King was proclaimed yesterday with great pomp, with great joy to us all; for which God be praised.

1660-05-09 11:10 Came Mr. Saunderson, that writ the story of the King, hither, who is going over to the King. He calls me cozen and seems a very knowing man.

1660-05-09 10:30 My Lord and I to write letters, which we sent by Mr. Cook, who was desirous to go because of seeing my wife before she went out of town.

1660-05-09 07:10 Writing a letter to the King, wherein my Lord do give most humble thanks for his gracious declaration; and promises all obedience to him.

1660-05-08 22:40 After supper some musique and to bed.

1660-05-08 18:30 My letters to-day tell me how it was intended that the King should be proclaimed to-day in London, with a great deal of pomp.

1660-05-08 16:50 My Lord and we at nine-pins: I lost 9s.

1660-05-08 15:50 Mr. Cook went to Huntsmore to see my wife, and brought her to London, where he left her at my father’s, and speaks well of her love to me.

1660-05-08 14:30 After dinner come several persons of honour, as my Lord St. John and others, for convoy to Flushing, and great giving of them salutes.

1660-05-08 00:50 Mr. Sheply and W. Howe sat in my cabin, where I gave them three bottles of Margate ale, and sat laughing and very merry, and so good night.

1660-05-07 17:10 A great deal of company, among others Mr. Bellasses, Sir Thomas Lenthropp, Sir Henry Chichley, Colonel Philip Honiwood, and Captain Titus.

1660-05-07 16:30 In the afternoon I lost 5s. at ninepins.

1660-05-07 11:30 My Lord did give me order to write for silk flags and scarlett waistcloathes. For a rich barge; a noise of trumpets, and a set of fidlers.

1660-05-07 11:00 My Lord went this morning about the flag-ships in a boat, to see what alterations there must be, as to the arms and flags.

1660-05-07 09:30 Captain Cuttance sent me 12 bottles of Margate ale. Three of them I drank presently with some friends in the Coach.

1660-05-06 20:10 I looked over my accounts, and find that, all my debts paid and my preparations to sea paid for, I have 40l. clear in my purse.

1660-05-06 17:00 My Lord writ a letter to the King and give it to me to carry privately to Sir William Compton on board the Assistance.

1660-05-06 16:30 An officer of Dunkirk told me he was lately with my uncle and Aunt Fenner and that Kate’s fits of the convulsions did hold her still.

1660-05-06 15:10 One Mr. Stanley prayed for King Charles, by the Grace of God, &c., which gave great contentment to the gentlemen that were on board here.

1660-05-06 13:40 I remember that last night upon discourse concerning Clarges my Lord told me that he was a man of small entendimiento.

1660-05-05 21:50 Never was there so general a content as there is now.
