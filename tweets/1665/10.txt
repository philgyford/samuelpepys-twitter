1665-10-16 19:06 To the Still Yard, which place, however, is now shut up of the plague; but I was there, and we now make no bones of it.

1665-10-16 11:23 They tell me that, in Westminster, there is never a physician and but one apothecary left, all being dead; but that there are great hopes of a great decrease this week: God send it!

1665-10-16 11:15 Lord! how empty the streets are and melancholy, so many poor sick people in the streets full of sores; and so many sad stories overheard as I walk, every body talking of this dead, and that man sick, and so many in this place, and so many in that.

1665-10-16 08:22 Mr. Povy discoursing of the wantonness of the Court. The King doth spend most of his time in feeling and kissing them naked all over their bodies in bed and contents himself, without doing the other thing but as he finds himself inclined.

1665-10-15 21:06 I did never hear one sing with so much pleasure to herself as this lady do, relishing it to her very heart, which was mighty pleasant.

1665-10-15 20:48 To Mr. Povy’s, and after supper to talk and to sing, his man Dutton’s wife singing very pleasantly (a mighty fat woman), and I wrote out one song from her and pricked the tune, both very pretty.

1665-10-15 16:15 Sir Robert Viner and I fell to public talk, and to think how the fleet and seamen will be paid, which he protests he do not think it possible to compass, as the world is now: no money got by trade, nor the persons that have it by them in the City to be come at.

1665-10-15 09:05 Mr. Povy and I set out, having drunk a draft of mulled sacke; and so rode most nobly, in his most pretty and best contrived charriott in the world, with many new conveniences.

1665-10-15 07:30 While I staid for the barber, tried to compose a duo of counterpoint, and I think it will do very well, it being by Mr. Berckenshaw’s rule.

1665-10-14 19:38 The town, I hear, is full of talk that there are great differences in the fleet among the great Commanders, and that Mings at Oxford did impeach my Lord of something, I think about these goods, but this is but talke.

1665-10-13 16:14 The Duke tells me that there is no news heard of the Dutch, what they do or where they are, but believes that they are all gone home, for none of our spyes can give us any tidings of them.

1665-10-13 15:30 I by water to the Duke of Albemarle, where I find him with Lord Craven and Lieutenant of the Tower about him; among other things, talking of ships to get of the King to fetch coles for the poor of the city, which is a good work.

1665-10-13 08:05 Comes Sir Jer. Smith to see me in his way to Court, and a good man he is, and one that I must keep fair with, and will, it being I perceive my interest to have kindness with the Commanders.

1665-10-12 19:20 Good news this week that there are about 600 less dead of the plague than the last.

1665-10-11 22:10 Having danced with my people as long as I saw fit to sit up, I to bed and left them to do what they would.

1665-10-11 20:50 This night is kept in lieu of yesterday, for my wedding day of ten years; for which God be praised! being now in an extreme good condition of health and estate and honour.

1665-10-11 20:35 A fine company at my lodgings at Woolwich, where my wife and Mercer, and Mrs. Barbara danced, and mighty merry we were, but especially at Mercer’s dancing a jigg, which she does the best I ever did see, having the most natural way of it.

1665-10-11 10:12 So for three rooms and a dining-room, and for linen and bread and beer and butter, at nights and mornings, I am to give Mrs. Clerke 5l. 10s. per month.

1665-10-11 10:10 Comes up my landlady, Mrs. Clerke, to make an agreement for the time to come; and I, for the having room enough, and to keep out strangers, and to have a place to retreat to for my wife, if the sickness should come to Woolwich, am contented to pay dear.

1665-10-10 20:40 Sir Christopher Mings is newly come from Court, and carries direction for the making a show of getting out the fleet again to go fight the Dutch.

1665-10-09 20:36 The news of the killing of the King of France is wholly untrue, and they say that of the Pope too.

1665-10-09 16:06 I hear another seizure hath been made of our goods by one Captain Fisher that hath been at Chatham by warrant of the Duke of Albemarle, and is come in my absence to Tooker’s and viewed them, demanding the key of the constable, and so sealed up the door.

1665-10-09 14:47 To the office at London, where I did some business about my money and private accounts, and there eat a bit of goose of Mr. Griffin’s, and so by water, it raining most miserably, to Greenwich, calling on several vessels in my passage.

1665-10-09 07:50 Called upon by Sir John Shaw, to whom I did give a civil answer about our prize goods, and showed him our Transire; with which he was satisfied, and parted, ordering his servants to see the weight of them.

1665-10-08 19:55 It seems nobody can make anything of Sir Martin Noell’s estate, whether he be dead worth anything or no, he having dealt in so many things, public and private, as nobody can understand whereabouts his estate is, which is the fate of these great dealers at everything.

1665-10-08 19:10 I hear the Pope is dead; and one said, that the news is, that the King of France is stabbed, but that the former is very true, which will do great things sure, as to the troubling of that part of the world, the King of Spain being so lately dead.

1665-10-08 15:50 To the office, where ended my business with the Captains of the ships in the river; and I think of twenty-two ships we shall make shift to get out seven. (God help us! men being sick, or provisions lacking.)

1665-10-08 14:20 Both before and after dinner, most witty discourse with one Mrs. Penington, who is a very fine witty lady, one of the best I ever heard speak, and indifferent handsome.

1665-10-07 17:18 After some hot and angry words, we locked the goods up, and sealed up the key, and did give it to the constable to keep, and so parted.

1665-10-07 17:04 Come two waggons from Rochester with more goods from Captain Cocke; and in housing them at Mr. Tooker’s lodgings come two of the Custome-house to seize them, and did seize them but I showed them my Transire.

1665-10-07 16:20 A letter come from the Duke of Albemarle, signifying the Dutch to be in sight, with 80 sail, yesterday morning, off of Solebay, coming right into the bay. God knows what they will and may do to us.

1665-10-07 10:33 Did business, though not much, at the office; because of the horrible crowd and lamentable moan of the poor seamen that lie starving in the streets for lack of money – which do trouble and perplex me to the heart.

1665-10-06 10:12 Mr. Gawden did tell me his opinion and knowledge of Sir W. Pen to be, what I know him to be, as false a man as ever was born, for so, it seems, he hath been to him.

1665-10-05 15:32 Mr. Evelyn showed me his gardens, which are for variety of evergreens, and hedge of holly, the finest things I ever saw in my life. Thence in his coach to Greenwich, and there to my office, all the way having fine discourse of trees and the nature of vegetables.

1665-10-05 14:26 To Mr. Evelyn’s to discourse of our confounded business of prisoners, and sick and wounded seamen, wherein he and we are so much put out of order.

1665-10-05 12:20 I walked through Westminster to my old house the Swan, and there did pass some time with Sarah, and so down by water to Deptford. Round about and next door on every side is the plague, but I did not value it, but there did what I would con ella.

1665-10-05 09:10 To the Duke of Albemarle, all my way reading a book of Mr. Evelyn’s translating and sending me as a present, about directions for gathering a Library; but the book is above my reach.

1665-10-04 21:06 Sir George Smith says how all the town is full of Captain Cocke’s being in some ill condition about prize-goods, his goods being taken from him, and I know not what. I believe this news is all false, for he would have wrote to me sure about it.

1665-10-04 20:50 This night comes Sir George Smith to see me at the office, and tells me how the plague is decreased this week 740, for which God be praised! but that it encreases at our end of the town still

1665-10-03 21:35 I hear that of our two watermen that use to carry our letters, and were well on Saturday last, one is dead, and the other dying sick of the plague.

1665-10-03 20:22 Most of our mirth being upon “my Cozen” (meaning my Lord Bruncker’s ugly mistress, whom he calls cozen), and she tells me that the fine Mrs. Middleton is noted for carrying about her body a continued sour base smell, that is very offensive, especially if she be a little hot.

1665-10-03 20:03 I to Mrs. Pierces and brought my wife and Mrs. Pierce to the King’s Head and there spent a piece upon a supper for her and mighty merry and pretty discourse, she being as pretty as ever.

1665-10-03 08:27 To the office, where nobody to meet me, Sir W. Batten being the only man and he gone this day to meet to adjourne the Parliament to Oxford.

1665-10-02 22:04 I got to Woolwich and there supped and mighty pleasant with my wife, who is, for ought I see, all friends with her maids, and so in great joy and content to bed.

1665-10-02 11:31 Lord! to see what a dreadful thing it is to look down the precipices, for it did fright me mightily, and hinder me of much pleasure which I would have made to myself in the company of these three, if it had not been for that.

1665-10-02 11:29 Going up I did upon the stairs overtake three pretty maids or women and took them up with me, and I did besarlas muchas vezes et tocar leur mains and necks to my great pleasure.

1665-10-02 11:10 To Rochester, walked to the Crowne, and while dinner was getting ready, I did there walk to visit the old Castle ruines, which hath been a noble place.

1665-10-02 08:20 Among other things, a teame of four horses come close by us, he being with me, drawing a piece of timber that I am confident one man could easily have carried upon his back. I made the horses be taken away, and a man or two to take the timber away with their hands.

1665-10-02 08:04 We having sailed all night (and I do wonder how they in the dark could find the way) we got by morning to Gillingham, and thence all walked to Chatham; and there with Commissioner Pett viewed the Yard.

1665-10-02 02:04 Lord! the mirth which it caused me to be waked in the night by their snoaring round about me; I did laugh till I was ready to burst, and waked one of the two companions of Temple.

1665-10-01 17:16 My Lord did whisper to me alone that things here must break in pieces, nobody minding any thing, but every man his own business of profit or pleasure, and that certainly the kingdom could not stand in this condition long, which I fear and believe is very true.

1665-10-01 16:45 My Lord did discourse to us of the Dutch fleet being abroad, eighty-five of them still, and are now at the Texell, he believes, in expectation of our Eastland ships coming home with masts and hemp, and our loaden Hambrough ships going to Hambrough.

1665-10-01 14:05 We come to the fleet about two of the clock in the afternoon, having a fine day and a fine winde.

1665-10-01 11:30 We spent most of the morning talking and reading of “The Siege of Rhodes,” which is certainly (the more I read it the more I think so) the best poem that ever was wrote.

1665-10-01 04:20 Called up about 4 of the clock and so dressed myself and so on board the Bezan, and there finding all my company asleep I would not wake them, but it beginning to be break of day I did stay upon the decke walking.
