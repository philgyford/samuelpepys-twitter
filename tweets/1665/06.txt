1665-06-30 15:12 I down to Woolwich and after me my wife and Mercer, whom I led to Mr. Sheldon’s to see his house, and I find it a very pretty place for them to be at.

1665-06-29 22:04 About 10 a’clock home, the days being sensibly shorter before I have once kept a summer’s day by shutting up office by daylight.

1665-06-29 09:32 Calling at Somersett House, where all are packing up too: the Queene-Mother setting out for France this day to drink Bourbon waters this year, she being in a consumption.

1665-06-29 07:12 This end of the town every day grows very bad of the plague. The Mortality Bill is come to 267; which is about ninety more than the last: and of these but four in the City, which is a great blessing to us.

1665-06-28 21:50 My Lord Sandwich is gone towards the sea to-day, it being a sudden resolution, I having taken no leave of him.

1665-06-28 14:08 To Paul’s churchyard and bespoke several books, and so home and there dined, my man William giving me a lobster sent him by my old maid Sarah.

1665-06-28 10:05 I met with Sir G. Carteret, who tells me how all things proceed between my Lord Sandwich and himself to full content, and both sides depend upon having the match finished presently, and professed great kindness to me.

1665-06-27 13:40 Dined by chance at my Lady Batten’s, and they sent for my wife, and there was my Lady Pen and Pegg. Very merry.

1665-06-26 21:30 The plague encreases mightily, I this day seeing a house, at a bitt-maker’s over against St. Clement’s Church, in the open street, shut up; which is a sad sight.

1665-06-26 17:10 Sheldon desires and expects my wife coming thither to spend the summer, and upon second thoughts I do agree that it will be a good place for her and me too.

1665-06-26 13:55 I home, and there find my wife’s brother and his wife. He did come to desire my assistance for a living, and, upon his good promises of care, and that it should be no burden to me, I did promise I would think of finding something for him.

1665-06-26 12:50 With Creed to the King’s Head, and there dined with him, and good sport with one Mr. Nicholls, a prating coxcomb, that would be thought a poet, but would not be got to repeat any of his verses.

1665-06-25 17:59 My Lord, I perceive, intends to give 5000l. with his daughter, and expects about 800l. per annum joynture.

1665-06-25 17:54 My Lord did direct me to return to Sir G. Carteret, and give him thanks for his kind reception of this offer, and that he would the next day be willing to enter discourse with him about the business.

1665-06-25 17:48 After I had again visited Sir G. Carteret, and received his (and now his Lady’s) full content in my proposal, I went to my Lord Sandwich, and having told him how Sir G. Carteret received it.

1665-06-25 15:23 The nation hath a great loss; though I cannot, without dissembling, say that I am sorry for it, for Sir J. Lawson was a man never kind to me at all.

1665-06-25 15:20 I went down to Greenwich by water, thinking to have visited Sir J. Lawson, where, when I come, I find that he is dead, and died this morning, at which I was much surprized.

1665-06-24 17:50 I to Sir G. Carteret at his chamber, and in the best manner I could, moved the business: he received it with great respect and content, and thanks to me, and promised that he would do what he could possibly for his son, to render him fit for my Lord’s daughter.

1665-06-24 16:15 To Dr. Clerke, and there found that he had broke the business to Sir G. Carteret, and that he takes the thing mighty well.

1665-06-24 07:32 Dr. Clerke did undertake to find out Sir George this morning, and put the business in execution.

1665-06-24 07:24 At Dr. Clerke’s, and there I, in the best manner I could, broke my errand about a match between Sir G. Carteret’s eldest son and my Lord Sandwich’s eldest daughter, which he (as I knew he would) took with great content.

1665-06-23 21:39 I home by hackney-coach, which is become a very dangerous passage now-a-days, the sickness increasing mightily. And to bed.

1665-06-23 20:48 Mr. Fox and I took boat and to Fox Hall, where we spent two or three hours talking of several matters very soberly and contentfully to me, which, with the ayre and pleasure of the garden, was a great refreshment to me.

1665-06-23 10:32 My Lord propounded to match my Lady Jemimah to Sir G. Carteret’s eldest son, which I approved of, and did undertake the speaking with him about it as from myself, which my Lord liked.

1665-06-23 09:04 To a Committee for Tangier, where his Royal Highness was. At this Committee, unknown to me, comes my Lord of Sandwich, who, it seems, come to town last night.

1665-06-22 19:42 It seems my mother was to the last unwilling to go, but would not say so, but put it off till she lost her place in the coach, and was fain to ride in the waggon part.

1665-06-22 09:32 My mother agreed to go, so I would not oppose it, because of the sickness in the town, and my intentions of removing my wife.

1665-06-22 07:10 In great pain whether to send my mother into the country to-day or no. She, poor wretch, hath a mind to stay longer, and I cannot blame her, considering what a life she will through her own folly lead when she comes home again, unlike the pleasure and liberty she hath had here.

1665-06-21 19:22 To the Cross Keys at Cripplegate, where I find all the town almost going out of town, the coaches and waggons being all full of people going into the country.

1665-06-20 21:40 I informed myself that there died four or five at Westminster of the plague in one alley in several houses upon Sunday last, Bell Alley, over against the Palace-gate.

1665-06-20 19:04 By water to Fox-hall, and there walked an hour alone, observing the several humours of the citizens that were there this holiday, pulling of cherries, and God knows what.

1665-06-20 16:55 Walked to Herbert’s and there spent a little time avec la mosa, sin hazer algo con ella que kiss and tocar ses mamelles, que me haza hazer la cosa a mi mismo con gran plaisir.

1665-06-20 14:35 To the Dolphin Taverne, where all we officers of the Navy met with the Commissioners of the Ordnance by agreement, and dined: where good musique at my direction. Our club come to 34s. a man, nine of us.

1665-06-19 16:02 With Sir W. Pen from the office down to Greenwich to see Sir J. Lawson, who is better, but continues ill; his hickupp not being yet gone, could have little discourse with him.

1665-06-18 18:33 I hear Sir W. Batten and my Lady are returned from Harwich. I went to see them, and it is pretty to see how we appear kind one to another, though neither of us care 2d. one for another.

1665-06-18 09:20 To church, where Sir W. Pen was the first time come from sea, after the battle. Mr. Mills made a sorry sermon to prove that there was a world to come after this.

1665-06-17 20:41 Sir John Lawson is worse than yesterday. It seems his wound is not very bad; but he hath a fever, a thrush, and a hickup, all three together, which are, it seems, very bad symptoms.

1665-06-17 15:25 I ’light and went into another coach, with a sad heart for the poor man and trouble for myself, lest he should have been struck with the plague, being at the end of the towne that I took him up; but God have mercy upon us all!

1665-06-17 15:23 It struck me very deep going with a hackney coach down Holborne, the coachman come down hardly able to stand, and told me that he was suddenly struck very sicke, and almost blind, he could not see.

1665-06-17 05:50 My wife come to bed about one in the morning.

1665-06-16 17:40 Mr. Coventry thinks the Dutch cannot have lost less than 6000 men, and we not dead above 200, and wounded about 400; in all about 600.

1665-06-16 17:25 Strange to hear how the Dutch do relate, as the Duke says, that they are the conquerors; and bonefires are made in Dunkirke in their behalf; though a clearer victory can never be expected.

1665-06-16 16:45 I saw Mr. Coventry, which rejoiced my very heart. Anon he and I, from all the rest of the company, walked into the Matted Gallery; where after many expressions of love, we fell to talk of business.

1665-06-16 15:53 Captain Grove hath done the basest thing at Lowestoffe, in hearing of the guns, and could not (as others) be got out, but staid there; for which he will be tried; and is reckoned a prating coxcombe, and of no courage.

1665-06-16 15:40 My Lord Sandwich, both in his counsells and personal service, hath done most honourably and serviceably. Sir J. Lawson is come to Greenwich; but his wound in his knee yet very bad.

1665-06-16 15:14 I to White Hall, where the Court is full of the Duke and his courtiers returned from sea. All fat and lusty, and ruddy by being in the sun.

1665-06-15 21:15 The town grows very sickly, and people to be afeard of it; there dying this last week of the plague 112, from 43 the week before, whereof one in Fanchurch-street, and one in Broad-streete.

1665-06-15 18:29 At Woolwich, discoursed with Mr. Sheldon about my bringing my wife down for a month or two to his house, which he approves of, and, I think, will be very convenient.

1665-06-15 15:10 Wife and Mercer and I to the Old Exchange, and there bought two lace bands more, one of my semstresse, whom my wife concurs with me to be a pretty woman.

1665-06-15 13:32 Put on my first laced band, all lace; and to Kate Joyce’s to dinner, where my mother, wife, and abundance of their friends, and good usage.

1665-06-15 07:03 Up, and put on my new stuff suit with close knees, which becomes me most nobly, as my wife says.

1665-06-14 17:04 Creed and I to Westminster; and there saw my Lord Marlborough brought to be buried, several Lords of the Council carrying him, and with the herald in some state.

1665-06-14 14:30 Drew up a petition for Mr. Hater to present to the Council about his troublesome business of powder, desiring a trial that his absence may be vindicated.

1665-06-14 11:44 To my Lord Treasurer’s, there to speak with him, and waited in the lobby three long hours for to speak with him, to the trial of my utmost patience, but missed him at last, and forced to go home without it, which may teach me how I make others wait.

1665-06-13 14:24 With Sir G. Carteret to my Lord Mayor’s to dinner, where much company in a little room, and though a good, yet no extraordinary table.

1665-06-12 10:33 In my yesterday’s new suit to the Duke of Albemarle, and after a turn in White Hall, returned, and with my taylor bought some gold lace for my sleeve hands in Paternoster Row.

1665-06-11 22:04 Comes Mr. Andrews and his wife and Mr. Hill, and staid and played, and sung and supped, most excellent pretty company, so pleasant, ingenious, and harmless, I cannot desire better.

1665-06-11 15:43 I saw poor Dr. Burnett’s door shut; but he hath, I hear, gained great goodwill among his neighbours; for he discovered it himself first, and caused himself to be shut up of his own accord. Which was very handsome.

1665-06-11 08:14 Comes my new suit of coloured ferrandin, which my wife puts me out of love with, which vexes me, but I think it is only my not being used to wear colours which makes it look a little unusual upon me.

1665-06-10 22:22 To bed, being troubled at the sickness, and my head filled also with other business enough, and particularly how to put my things and estate in order, in case it should please God to call me away, which God dispose of to his glory!

1665-06-10 20:32 To my great trouble hear that the plague is come into the City (though it hath since its beginning been wholly out of the City); but where should it begin but in my good friend and neighbour’s, Dr. Burnett, in Fanchurch Street.

1665-06-09 21:37 Very merry we were, and the more I know the more I like Mr. Honiwood’s conversation.

1665-06-09 21:14 By and by comes Mr. Honiwood and Mrs. Wilde, and Roger Pepys and, after long time spent, Mrs. Turner, The. and Joyce. We had a very good venison pasty, this being instead of my stone-feast the last March.

1665-06-09 15:44 With my taylor to buy a silk suit, which though I had one lately, yet I do, for joy of the good news we have lately had of our victory over the Dutch, which makes me willing to spare myself something extraordinary in clothes.

1665-06-09 11:10 Home, where my people busy to make ready a supper against night for some guests, in lieu of my stonefeast.

1665-06-09 09:05 The King is much troubled at the fall of my Lord of Falmouth; but I do not meet with any man else that so much as wishes him alive again, the world conceiving him a man of too much pleasure to do the King any good.

1665-06-08 22:58 Home to bed, with my heart at great rest and quiet, saving that the consideration of the victory is too great for me presently to comprehend.

1665-06-08 20:42 To my Lady Pen’s, where they are all joyed and not a little puffed up at the good success of their father; and good service indeed is said to have been done by him.

1665-06-08 18:25 Admirall Opdam blown up, Trump killed. All the rest of their admiralls, as they say, but Everson, are killed: we having taken and sunk about 24 of their best ships; killed and taken near 8 or 10,000 men, and lost, we think, not above 700.

1665-06-08 18:22 Earle of Marlborough, Portland, Rear-Admirall Sansum killed, and Capt. Kirby and Ableson. Sir John Lawson wounded on the knee; hath had some bones taken out, and is likely to be well again.

1665-06-08 18:20 The Earl of Falmouth, Muskery, and Mr. Richard Boyle killed on board the Duke’s ship, the Royall Charles, with one shot: their blood and brains flying in the Duke’s face; and the head of Mr. Boyle striking down the Duke, as some say.

1665-06-08 15:33 I met with the great news at last newly come, brought by Bab May from the Duke of Yorke, that we have totally routed the Dutch; that the Duke himself, the Prince, my Lord Sandwich, and Mr. Coventry are all well.

1665-06-07 20:48 To Fox-Hall, to the Spring garden, and there walked an hour or two with great pleasure, saving our minds ill at ease concerning the fleet and my Lord Sandwich.

1665-06-07 18:06 It being the hottest day that ever I felt in my life, we to the New Exchange, and there drunk whey, with much entreaty getting it for our money, and would not be entreated to let us have one glasse more.

1665-06-07 17:40 It put me into an ill conception of myself and my smell, so that I was forced to buy some roll-tobacco to smell to and chaw, which took away the apprehension.

1665-06-07 17:38 Much against my will I did in Drury Lane see two or three houses marked with a red cross upon the doors, and “Lord have mercy upon us” writ there; which was a sad sight to me, being the first of the kind that I ever saw.

1665-06-07 07:05 My wife and mother rose about two o’clock; and with Mercer, Mary, the boy, and W. Hewer, as they had designed, took boat and down to refresh themselves on the water to Gravesend.

1665-06-06 20:04 To my Lady Sandwich’s, who, poor lady, expects every hour to hear of my Lord; but in the best temper, neither confident nor troubled with fear, that I ever did see in my life.

1665-06-06 12:55 To dinner with Sir G. Carteret to his house with all our Board, where a good pasty and brave discourse.

1665-06-06 03:49 Waked in the morning with great pain to piss, and great pain in pissing by having, I think, drank too great a draught of cold drink before going to bed.

1665-06-05 12:10 News that our ship Charity is lost upon our Captain’s yielding, but of this there is no certainty, save the report of some of the sick men, turned adrift in a boat and taken up and brought on shore yesterday to Sole Bay.

1665-06-04 21:55 News being come that our fleet is pursuing the Dutch, who, either by cunning, or by being worsted, do give ground, but nothing more for certain.

1665-06-04 20:21 At my accounts, which I could not do sooner, for the last month, and, blessed be God! am worth 1400l. odd money, something more than ever I was yet in the world.

1665-06-03 21:33 All this day, by all people upon the River and almost every where else hereabout, were heard the guns, our two fleets for certain being engaged; which was confirmed by letters from Harwich.

1665-06-03 13:13 Home, vexed to be kept from the office all the morning, which I had not been in many months before, if not some years.

1665-06-03 12:04 Comes in the Secretary, and upon entering recognizances, he for 200l, and Mr. Hunt and I for 100l. each for his appearance upon demand, Mr. Hater was released, it costing him, I think, above 3l.

1665-06-03 09:22 To White Hall, where Sir G. Carteret did go with me to Secretary Morris, and prevailed with him to let Mr. Hater be released upon bail for his appearance.

1665-06-02 19:45 To Sir G. Carteret about Hater, and shall have him released to-morrow, upon my giving bail for his appearance, which I have promised to do.

1665-06-02 18:12 A letter come to me from Mr. Hater, upon the misfortune of having his name used by one, without his knowledge or privity, for the receiving of some powder that he had bought.

1665-06-02 16:40 Home, and there met an express from Sir W. Batten at Harwich, that the fleet is all sailed from Solebay, having spied the Dutch fleet at sea, and that, if the calmes hinder not, they must needs now be engaged with them.

1665-06-01 23:10 Broke up, and away without any notice, and, after delivering the rose where it should be, I to the Temple and ’light, and come to the middle door, and there took another coach, and so home

1665-06-01 22:05 I ’light, and in with the fairest flower to eat a cake, and there did do as much as was safe with my flower, and that was enough on my part.

1665-06-01 21:15 I took coach and to Westminster Hall, where I took the fairest flower, and by coach to Tothill Fields for the ayre till it was dark.

1665-06-01 17:28 We walked to Cornehill, and there at Mr. Cade’s stood in the balcon and saw all the funeral, which was with the blue-coat boys and old men, all the Aldermen, and Lord Mayor, &c, and the number of the company very great.

1665-06-01 16:30 To Goldsmiths’ Hall, to the burial of Sir Thomas Viner; which Hall, and Haberdashers also, was so full of people, that we were fain for ease and coolness to go forth to Paternoster Row, to choose a silk to make me a plain ordinary suit.

1665-06-01 14:10 After dinner I put on my new silk camelott sute; the best that ever I wore in my life, the sute costing me above 24l.
