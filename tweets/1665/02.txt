1665-02-28 22:27 And so ends this month, with great expectation of the Hollanders coming forth, who are, it seems, very high and rather more ready than we. God give a good issue to it!

1665-02-28 16:10 I to the taking my wife’s kitchen accounts at the latter end of the month, and there find 7s. wanting, which did occasion a very high falling out between us, I indeed too angrily insisting upon so poor a thing, and did give her very provoking high words, calling her beggar.

1665-02-27 16:27 To walk alone a good while in St. James’s Parke with Mr. Coventry, who I perceive is grown a little melancholy and displeased to see things go as they do so carelessly.

1665-02-27 15:48 To a Committee of the Council; but, Lord! how they meet; never sit down: one comes, now another goes, then comes another; one complaining that nothing is done, another swearing that he hath been there these two hours and nobody come.

1665-02-27 12:20 To the ‘Change to inquire what wages the Dutch give in their men-of-war at this day, and I hear for certain they give but twelve guilders at most, which is not full 24s, a thing I wonder at.

1665-02-26 19:20 Comes Mr. Andrews and Hill, and so home and to singing. Hill staid and supped with me, and very good discourse of Italy, where he was, which is always to me very agreeable.

1665-02-25 22:48 Late home, and to clean myself with warm water; my wife will have me, because she do herself, and so to bed.

1665-02-25 12:17 It is said the judges, upon demand, did give it their opinion that the law would judge the Swede to be whipt, to lose his eares, or to have his nose slit but I do not hear that anything more is to be done to him.

1665-02-25 12:15 The Swede that had told the King and the Duke so boldly this great lie of the Dutch flinging our men back to back into the sea at Guinny, so particularly, and readily, and confidently, was whipt round the ’Change: he confessing it a lie.

1665-02-24 19:10 In my chamber, and Mr. Hater with me (to prevent being disturbed at the office), to perfect my contract book, which, for want of time, hath a long time lain without being entered in as I used to do from month to month.

1665-02-24 10:33 Advising again with some fishermen and the water bayliffe of the City, by Mr. Coventry’s direction, touching the protections which are desired for the fishermen upon the River, and I am glad of the occasion to make me understand something of it.

1665-02-23 12:25 But, Lord! to see the consternation all our merchants are in is observable, and with what fury and revenge they discourse of it.

1665-02-23 12:20 I hear the most horrid and astonishing newes that ever was yet told, that De Ruyter with his fleete in Guinny hath proceeded to the taking of whatever we have, forts, goods, ships, and men, and tied our men back to back, and thrown them all into the sea, women and children also.

1665-02-23 07:03 This day, by the blessing of Almighty God, I have lived thirty-two years in the world, and am in the best degree of health at this minute that I have been almost in my life time, and at this time in the best condition of estate that ever I was in — the Lord make me thankfull.

1665-02-22 07:38 Lay last night alone, my wife after her bathing lying alone in another bed. So cold all night.

1665-02-21 22:10 My Lady tells me what mad freaks the Mayds of Honour at Court have: that Mrs. Jenings, one of the Duchesses mayds, the other day dressed herself like an orange wench, and went up and down and cried oranges.

1665-02-21 22:04 To Lincolne’s Inne Fields, and there I with my Lady Sandwich (good lady) talking of innocent discourse of good housewifery and husbands for her daughters, and the luxury and looseness of the times and other such things.

1665-02-21 13:39 Off of the ’Change with Mr. Wayth to a cook’s shop, and there dined again for discourse with him about Hamaccos and the abuse now practised in tickets, and more like every day to be.

1665-02-21 12:12 My wife being busy in going with her woman to a hot-house to bathe herself, after her long being within doors in the dirt, so that she now pretends to a resolution of being hereafter very clean. How long it will hold I can guess.

1665-02-21 08:40 Up, and to the office (having a mighty pain in my forefinger of my left hand, from a strain that it received last night) in struggling avec la femme que je mentioned yesterday.

1665-02-20 21:55 My wife comes and tells me that she hath hired a chamber mayde, one of the prettiest maydes that ever she saw in her life, and that she is really jealous of me for her, but hath ventured to hire her from month to month, but I think she means merrily.

1665-02-20 21:20 Being sated therewith, I walked home to Redriffe, and there I did drink some strong waters and eat some bread and cheese, and so home.

1665-02-20 19:33 I landed at the lower end of the town, and it being dark entrer en la maison de la femme de Bagwell, and there had sa compagnie, though with a great deal of difficulty, néanmoins enfin je avais ma volonté d’elle.

1665-02-20 15:30 To the office, and there found Bagwell’s wife, whom I directed to go home, and I would do her business, which was to write a letter to my Lord Sandwich for her husband’s advance into a better ship as there should be occasion.

1665-02-20 09:10 We rode into the beginning of my Lord Chancellor’s new house, near St. James’s; which common people have already called Dunkirke-house, from their opinion of his having a good bribe for the selling of that towne.

1665-02-19 19:50 Hearing of my mayds their letting in a rogueing Scotch woman that haunts the office, to helpe them to washe in our house, and that very lately, I fell out, and made my wife, to the disturbance of the neighbours, to beat our little girle, and then we shut her down into the cellar.

1665-02-19 12:15 Lay in bed, it being Lord’s day, all the morning talking with my wife, sometimes pleased, sometimes displeased, and then up and to dinner.

1665-02-18 19:15 My Lord Sandwich, and his fleete of twenty-five ships in the Downes, returned from cruising, but could not meet with any Dutchmen.

1665-02-18 15:45 I took my Lord Sandwich’s draught of the harbour of Portsmouth down to Ratcliffe, to one Burston, to make a plat for the King, and another for the Duke, and another for himself; which will be very neat.

1665-02-18 13:10 To the Royall Oake taverne in Lumbard Streete, where Sir William Petty and the owners of the double-bottomed boat (the Experiment) did entertain my Lord Brunkard, Sir R. Murrey, myself, and others, with marrow bones and a chine of beefe.

1665-02-17 12:00 Home and there found Lewellin, which vexed me out of my old jealous humour.

1665-02-17 11:30 Had some high words with Sir J. Minnes about Sir W. Warren, he calling him cheating knave, but I cooled him.

1665-02-16 14:35 Poor Mrs. Batters brought a letter from her husband, wherein, as a token, the fool presents me very seriously with his daughter for me to take the charge of bringing up for him, and to make my owne. But I took no notice to her at all.

1665-02-16 09:50 Lord! to see to what a degree of contempt, nay, scorn, Mr. Povy, through his prodigious folly, hath brought himself in his accounts, that if he be not a man of a great interest, he will be kicked out of his employment for a fool, is very strange.

1665-02-15 17:30 Above all, Mr. Boyle to-day was at the meeting, and above him Mr. Hooke, who is the most, and promises the least, of any man in the world that ever I saw.

1665-02-15 17:25 It is a most acceptable thing to hear their discourse, and see their experiments; which were this day upon the nature of fire, and how it goes out in a place where the ayre is not free, and sooner out where the ayre is exhausted.

1665-02-15 17:20 With Creed to Gresham College, where I had been by Mr. Povy the last week proposed to be admitted a member; and was this day admitted, by signing a book and being taken by the hand by the President, my Lord Brunkard.

1665-02-15 13:35 To dinner to Trinity-house, where a very good dinner among the old sokers, where an extraordinary discourse of the manner of the loss of the “Royall Oake” coming home from Bantam, upon the rocks of Scilly.

1665-02-14 11:50 I and my boy abroad by coach to Westminster, where did two or three businesses, and then home to the ’Change, and did much business there.

1665-02-14 09:05 I up about business, and, opening the door, there was Bagwell’s wife, with whom I talked afterwards, and she had the confidence to say she came with a hope to be time enough to be my Valentine

1665-02-14 07:10 Comes betimes Dicke Pen, to be my wife’s Valentine, and come to our bedside. By the same token, I had him brought to my side, thinking to have made him kiss me; but he perceived me, and would not.

1665-02-13 11:55 To a Dutch house, and there light upon some Dutchmen, with whom we had discourse touching stoveing and making of cables. But to see how despicably they speak of us for our using so many hands more to do anything than they do, they closing a cable with 20, that we use 60 men upon.

1665-02-13 10:45 Coming home did go on board Sir W. Petty’s “Experiment,” which is a brave roomy vessel, and I hope may do well.

1665-02-13 10:22 By water (taking Mr. Stapely the rope-maker by the way), to his rope-ground and to Limehouse, there to see the manner of stoves and did excellently inform myself therein.

1665-02-12 21:57 In the evening comes Mr. Hill (but no Andrews) and we spent the evening very finely, singing, supping and discoursing.

1665-02-12 11:18 A gentleman sat in the pew I by chance sat in, that sang most excellently, and afterward I found by his face that he had been a Paul’s scholler, but know not his name, and I was also well pleased with the church, it being a very fine church.

1665-02-12 11:15 To church to St. Lawrence to hear Dr. Wilkins, the great scholar, for curiosity, I having never heard him: but was not satisfied with him at all.

1665-02-12 00:12 So home to bed.

1665-02-11 12:15 Up and to my office, where all the morning.

1665-02-10 09:40 Thence (in Mr. Grey’s coach, who took me up), to Westminster, where I heard that yesterday the King met the Houses to pass the great bill for the 2,500,000l.

1665-02-10 08:58 Abroad to Paul’s Churchyard, there to see the last of my books new bound: among others, my “Court of King James,” and “The Rise and Fall of the Family of the Stewarts.”

1665-02-09 13:10 Up and to my office, where all the morning very busy. At noon home to dinner, and then to my office again.

1665-02-08 10:04 Povy is one of the most unhappy accountants that ever I knew in all my life, and one that if I were clear in reference to my bill of 117l. he should be hanged before I would ever have to do with him.

1665-02-07 21:30 Sir W. Batten, who hath been sicke four or five days, is now very bad, so as people begin to fear his death; and I am at a loss whether it will be better for me to have him die, because he is a bad man, or live, for fear a worse should come.

1665-02-07 12:50 At home to dinner. It being Shrove Tuesday, had some very good fritters.

1665-02-07 11:55 This being one of the coldest days, all say, they ever felt in England; and I this day, under great apprehensions of getting an ague from my putting a suit on that hath lain by without ayring a great while, and I pray God it do not do me hurte.

1665-02-07 11:44 With Sir W. Warren 4 hours or more till very late, talking of one thing or another, and have concluded a firm league with him in all just ways to serve him and myself all I can.

1665-02-06 13:15 Home to dinner, and visited Sir W. Batten, who is sick again, worse than he was, and I am apt to think is very ill.

1665-02-05 20:58 Comes to see me Mr. Andrews and Hill, and we sang very pleasantly; and so, they being gone, I and my wife to supper, and to prayers and bed.

1665-02-05 11:45 Lay in bed most of the morning, then up and down to my chamber, among my new books, which is now a pleasant sight to me to see my whole study almost of one binding.

1665-02-04 21:20 I cruelly vexed in my mind that all my trouble in this world almost should arise from my disorders in my family and the indiscretion of a wife that brings me nothing almost (besides a comely person) but only trouble and discontent.

1665-02-04 13:06 This message he sent in a sluggbullet, being writ in cypher, and wrapped up in lead and swallowed. So the messenger come to my Lord and told him he had a message from the King, but it was yet in his belly; so they did give him some physique, and out it come.

1665-02-04 13:04 To dinner to my Lord Belasses, where a great deal of discourse with him. He told us a very handsome passage of the King’s sending him his message about holding out the town of Newarke, of which he was then governor for the King.

1665-02-04 07:44 Lay long in bed discoursing with my wife about her mayds, which by Jane’s going away in discontent and against my opinion do make some trouble between my wife and me.

1665-02-03 16:30 To visit my Lady Sandwich, where she discoursed largely to me her opinion of a match, if it could be thought fit by my Lord, for my Lady Jemimah, with Sir G. Carteret’s eldest son; but I doubt he hath yet no settled estate in land.

1665-02-03 12:49 To my uncle Wight’s, where the Wights all dined; and, among the others, pretty Mrs. Margaret, who indeed is a very pretty lady; and though by my vowe it costs me 12d. a kiss after the first, yet I did adventure upon a couple.

1665-02-03 11:12 Newes is come from Deale, that the same day my Lord Sandwich sailed thence with the fleete, that evening some Dutch men of warr were seen on the back side of the Goodwin

1665-02-03 10:22 Taking my books from binding from my bookseller’s. My bill for the rebinding of some old books to make them suit with my study, cost me, besides other new books in the same bill, 3l.; but it will be very handsome.

1665-02-03 07:40 Mrs. Turner was dressing herself by the fire in her chamber, and there took occasion to show me her leg, which indeed is the finest I ever saw, and she not a little proud of it.

1665-02-03 07:05 Walked with my boy (whom, because of my wife’s making him idle, I dare not leave at home) walked first to Salsbury court, there to excuse my not being at home at dinner to Mrs. Turner.

1665-02-02 19:10 My cook mayd Jane and her mistresse parted, and she went away this day. I vexed to myself, but was resolved to have no more trouble.

1665-02-02 14:32 Home, my head akeing for want of rest and too much business. So to the office.

1665-02-02 12:40 At the Coffee-house with Gifford, Hubland, the Master of the ship, and I read over and approved a charter-party for carrying goods for Tangier, wherein I hope to get some money.

1665-02-02 03:07 At this trouble we were till past three o’clock, and then the stinke ceasing, I to sleep, and my people to bed.

1665-02-02 01:45 We called up Sir J. Minnes’s and Sir W. Batten’s people, and Griffin, and the people at the madhouse, but nothing could be found to give occasion to it.

1665-02-02 01:10 After being in bed, my people come and say there is a great stinke of burning, but no smoake.

1665-02-02 00:16 After supper a song, or three or four (I having to that purpose carried Lawes’s book), and staying here till 12 o’clock got the watch to light me home.

1665-02-01 19:45 I with the boy to the Sun behind the Exchange, by agreement with Mr. Young the flag-maker, and there was met by Mr. Hill, Andrews, and Mr. Hubland, a pretty serious man.

1665-02-01 17:10 I put in to an ordinary by Temple Barr and there with my boy Tom eat a pullet, and thence home to the office, being still angry with my wife for yesterday’s foolery.

1665-02-01 11:10 I did go to the ’Change, and there after great pains did light of a business with Mr. Gifford and Hubland for bringing me as much as I hoped for, which I have at large expressed in my stating the case of the “King’s Fisher,” which is the ship that I have hired.

1665-02-01 07:50 Lay long in bed, which made me, going by coach to St. James’s by appointment to have attended the Duke of Yorke and my Lord Bellasses, lose the hopes of my getting something by the hire of a ship to carry men to Tangier.
