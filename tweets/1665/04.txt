1665-04-30 21:30 Great fears of the sickenesse here in the City, it being said that two or three houses are already shut up. God preserve us all!

1665-04-30 13:04 I find poor Mr. Spong walking at my door, where he had knocked, and being told I was at the office staid modestly there walking because of disturbing me, which methinks was one of the most modest acts that ever I knew in my life.

1665-04-30 11:52 I with great joy find myself to have gained this month above 100l. clear, and in the whole to be worth above 1400l, the greatest sum I ever yet was worth.

1665-04-30 11:48 To my office alone all the morning, making up my monthly accounts, which though it hath been very intricate, and very great disbursements and receipts and odd reckonings, yet I differed not from the truth.

1665-04-29 23:14 I do omit to write, as I should do, to Mr. Coventry, which I must not do, though this night I minded it so little as to sleep in the middle of my letter to him, and committed forty blotts and blurrs in my letter to him.

1665-04-29 20:30 Troubled in my mind to hear that Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes do take notice that I am now-a-days much from the office upon no office business, which vexes me, and will make me mind my business the better, I hope in God.

1665-04-28 15:20 My Lord Chancellor passing by stroked me on the head, and told me that the Board had read my letter, and taken order for the punishing of the watermen for not appearing on board the ships.

1665-04-28 13:55 I to write a letter to the Duke of Albemarle about the victualling-ships, and carried it myself to the Council-chamber.

1665-04-28 11:40 I down the River to visit the victualling-ships, where I find all out of order.

1665-04-27 20:10 William Hewer is returned from Harwich, where he hath been paying off of some ships, and went to sea a good way with the fleet, which was 96 in company then, men of warr, besides some come in, and following them since, which makes now above 100, whom God bless!

1665-04-26 11:10 To the Carrier’s by Cripplegate, to see whether my mother be come to town or no, I expecting her to-day, but she is not come.

1665-04-26 08:40 To Povy’s, and there I did receive the first parcel of money as Treasurer of Tangier, and did give him my receipt for it, which was about 2,800l. value in Tallys.

1665-04-26 04:55 Up very betimes, my cold continuing and my stomach sick with the buttered ale that I did drink the last night in bed, which did lie upon me till I did this morning vomitt it up.

1665-04-25 15:50 W. Pen, lately come from his father in the fleet, did give me an account how the fleet did sail, about 103 in all, besides small catches, they being in sight of six or seven Dutch scouts, and sent ships in chase of them.

1665-04-24 22:15 After a while at my office, home to supper and to bed, having got a great cold I think by my pulling off my periwigg so often.

1665-04-24 17:15 With my wife and Mercer to the Park; but the King being there, and I now-a-days being doubtfull of being seen in any pleasure, did part from the tour, and away out of the Park to Knightsbridge, and there eat and drank in the coach.

1665-04-24 16:28 I walked an hour with my Lord Duke of Albemarle alone in his garden, where he expressed in great words his opinion of me; that I was the right hand of the Navy here, nobody but I taking any care of any thing therein; so that he should not know what could be done without me.

1665-04-24 10:10 I to Creed’s chamber, where I received with much ado my two orders about receiving Povy’s monies and answering his credits, and it is strange how he will preserve his constant humour of delaying all business that comes before him.

1665-04-23 20:22 At supper to hear the arguments we had against Captain Taylor concerning a Corant, he saying that the law of a dancing Corant is to have every barr to end in a pricked crochet and quaver, which I did deny, was very strange.

1665-04-23 12:40 To Mr. Povy’s, where mightily treated, and Creed with us. But Lord! to see how Povy overdoes every thing in commending it, do make it nauseous to me, and was not (by reason of my large praise of his house) over acceptable to my wife.

1665-04-23 09:06 To White Hall Chappell and heard the famous young Stillingfleete, whom I knew at Cambridge. He did make the most plain, honest, good, grave sermon, in the most unconcerned and easy yet substantial manner, that ever I heard in my life.

1665-04-22 18:22 I have news from Mr. Coventry that the fleet is sailed yesterday from Harwich to the coast of Holland to see what the Dutch will do. God go along with them!

1665-04-22 07:03 Mr. Caesar, my boy’s lute-master, being come betimes to teach him, I did speak with him seriously about the boy, what my mind was, if he did not look after his lute and singing that I would turn him away.

1665-04-21 20:46 We hear that the Duke and the fleet are sailed yesterday. Pray God go along with them, that they have good speed in the beginning of their work.

1665-04-21 17:21 Home, and there found Kate Joyce and Harman come to see us. With them, after long talk, abroad by coach, a tour in the fields, and drunk at Islington, it being very pleasant, the dust being laid by a little rain.

1665-04-20 20:27 I am told the first play is played in White Hall noon-hall, which is now turned to a house of playing. I had a great mind, but could not go to see it.

1665-04-20 12:38 Dined, and Mr. Povy by agreement with me (where his boldness with Mercer, poor innocent wench, did make both her and me blush, to think how he were able to debauch a poor girl if he had opportunity) at a dish or two of plain meat of his own choice.

1665-04-19 16:35 To Gresham College, where we saw some experiments upon a hen, a dogg, and a cat, of the Florence poyson. The first it made for a time drunk, but it come to itself again; the second it made vomitt mightily, but no other hurt. The third I did not stay to see the effect of it.

1665-04-19 06:10 To Chelsy; where, after all my fears what doubts and difficulties my Lord Privy Seale would make at my Tangier Privy Seale, he did pass it at first reading, without my speaking with him. And then called me in, and was very civil to me.

1665-04-18 14:49 I to Sir Philip Warwicke and with him to my Lord Treasurer, who signed my commission for Tangier-Treasurer and the docquet of my Privy Seale, for the monies to be paid to me.

1665-04-17 21:10 This day was left at my house a silver watch, by one Briggs, a scrivener and sollicitor, at which I was angry with my wife for receiving, and so far witnessing our receipt of it, as to give the messenger 5s.; but it can’t be helped, and I will endeavour to do the man a kindness.

1665-04-17 11:05 To White Hall; where the King seeing me, did come to me, and calling me by name, did discourse with me about the ships in the River: and this is the first time that ever I knew the King did know me personally.

1665-04-17 09:15 News is brought the King that the Dutch Smyrna fleet is seen upon the back of Scotland; and thereupon the King hath wrote to the Duke, that he do appoint a fleet to go to the Northward to try to meet them coming home round: which God send!

1665-04-17 08:39 Everson, when he was brought before the Duke of Yorke, and was observed to be shot through the hat, answered, that he wished it had gone through his head, rather than been taken.

1665-04-17 08:35 To the Duke of Albemarle’s, where he shewed me Mr. Coventry’s letters, how three Dutch privateers are taken, in one whereof Everson’s son is captaine. But they have killed poor Captain Golding in The Diamond.

1665-04-16 21:55 I am told that news is come of our taking of three Dutch men-of-warr, with the loss of one of our Captains.

1665-04-16 20:22 Captain Taylor can show the very originall Charter to Worcester, of King Edgar’s, wherein he stiles himself, Rex Marium Brittanniae, &c.; which is the great text that Mr. Selden and others do quote, but imperfectly and upon trust.

1665-04-16 19:41 Comes Captain Taylor, that understands musique very well and composes mighty bravely; he brought us some things of two parts to sing, very hard. He is conceited of them, and that though they are good makes them troublesome to one, to see him every note commend and admire them.

1665-04-16 15:24 Creed and I walked to the Rolls’ Chappell, expecting to hear the great Stillingfleete preach, but he did not; but a very sorry fellow, which vexed me.

1665-04-16 10:04 To my chamber and my office, looking over some plates which I find necessary for me to understand pretty well, because of the Dutch warr.

1665-04-15 23:40 To the office, where all the morning, busy, then home to dinner, and then all the afternoon till very late at my office, and then home to supper and to bed, weary.

1665-04-14 18:33 To White Hall, where walked an hour with Mr. Wren, of my Lord Chancellor’s, and then to Unthanke’s and called my wife, and with her through the city to Mile-End Greene, and eat some cream and cakes and so back home.

1665-04-14 16:24 But I hear the contrary, both by letters of my own and messengers thence, that they were all well of our side and no enemy appears yet, and that the Royall Katherine is come to the fleet, and likely to prove as good a ship as any the King hath.

1665-04-14 16:22 This morning I was saluted with newes that the fleetes, ours and the Dutch, were engaged, and that the guns were heard at Walthamstow to play all yesterday, and that Captain Teddiman’s legs were shot off in the Royall Katherine.

1665-04-14 13:05 Creed and I to a cook’s shop at Charing Cross, and there had much discourse, and his very good upon my business, and upon other things, among the rest upon Will Howe’s dissembling with us, we discovering his carriage to us, being a very false fellow.

1665-04-14 09:01 My Lord Barkeley and some of the Commissioners coming together, I did procure that they should order Povy’s payment of his remain of accounts to me; which order if it do pass will put a good stop to the fastening of the thing upon me.

1665-04-13 15:04 Musique at and after dinner, and a fellow danced a jigg; but when the company begun to dance, I came away lest I should be taken out; and God knows how my wife carried herself, but I left her to try her fortune.

1665-04-13 14:32 To Sheriff Waterman’s to dinner, all of us men of the office in town, and our wives, my Lady Carteret and daughters, and Ladies Batten, Pen, and my wife, &c., and very good cheer we had and merry.

1665-04-12 19:44 To my Lady Batten’s, there found a great many women with her, in her chamber merry, my Lady Pen and her daughter, among others; where my Lady Pen flung me down upon the bed, and herself and others, one after another, upon me, and very merry we were.

1665-04-12 16:10 It is one of the saddest things that, at such a time as this, with the greatest action on foot that ever was in England, nothing should be minded, but let things go on of themselves do as well as they can.

1665-04-12 15:56 Sir G. Carteret, my Lord Brunkard, Sir Thomas Harvy, and myself, down to my Lord Treasurer’s chamber; and there I did give them a large account of the charge of the Navy, and want of money. But strange to see how they held up their hands crying, “What shall we do?”

1665-04-12 13:15 Dined at home and thence to White Hall again (where I lose most of my time now-a-days to my great trouble, charge, and loss of time and benefit).

1665-04-12 09:37 To a Committee of Tangier, where, contrary to all expectation, my Lord Ashly, being vexed with Povy’s accounts, did propose it as necessary that Povy should be still continued Treasurer of Tangier till he had made up his accounts.

1665-04-11 22:15 To the office, where late very busy, but with some trouble have also some hopes of profit too.

1665-04-11 12:55 Dined at the Sun, behind the ‘Change, with Sir Edward Deering and his brother and Commissioner Pett, we having made a contract with Sir Edward this day about timber.

1665-04-10 15:32 My Lord Brunkard took me and Sir Thomas Harvy in his coach to the Park, which is very troublesome with the dust; and ne’er a great beauty there to-day but Mrs. Middleton.

1665-04-10 10:08 Captain Cooke met me, and did seem discontented about my boy Tom’s having no time to mind his singing nor lute, which I answered him fully in, that he desired me that I would baste his coate.

1665-04-10 09:32 To White Hall to a Committee for Tangier, where new disorder about Mr. Povy’s accounts, that I think I shall never be settled in my business of Treasurer for him.

1665-04-09 15:20 To Fanchurch, the little church in the middle of Fanchurch Streete, where a very few people and few of any rank.

1665-04-09 09:04 To church with my wife, in her new light-coloured silk gown, which is, with her new point, very noble.

1665-04-08 22:03 We have laine a good while with a good fleet at Harwich. The Dutch not said yet to be out. We, as high as we make our shew, I am sure, are unable to set out another small fleet, if this should be worsted.

1665-04-08 19:15 The French Embassadors are come incognito before their train, which will hereafter be very pompous. It is thought they come to get our King to joyne with the King of France in helping him against Flanders, and they to do the like to us against Holland.

1665-04-08 16:36 To the Old Exchange and there of my new pretty seamstress bought four bands, and so home, where I found my house mighty neat and clean.

1665-04-07 16:22 Sir Philip did shew me nakedly the King’s condition for money for the Navy; and he do assure me it is impossible to find money: we having already, as he says, spent one year’s share of the three-years’ tax, which comes to 2,500,000l.

1665-04-07 08:10 To Westminster Hall and up and down, doing not much; then to London.

1665-04-07 06:30 Up betimes to the Duke of Albemarle about money to be got for the Navy, or else we must shut up shop.

1665-04-07 01:03 At my office writing letters till one o’clock in the morning, that I was ready to fall down asleep again.

1665-04-06 21:45 Great talks of a new Comett; and it is certain one do now appear as bright as the late one at the best; but I have not seen it myself.

1665-04-06 20:10 I went to Jervas’s, my barber, for my periwigg that was mending there, and there do hear that Jane is quite undone, taking the idle fellow for her husband yet not married, and lay with him several weeks that had another wife and child, and she is now going into Ireland.

1665-04-06 10:04 Sir G. Carteret being angry about the business of tickets, spoke of Sir W. Batten for speaking some words about the signing of tickets, and called Sir W. Batten in his discourse at the table to us (the clerks being withdrawn) “shitten foole,” which vexed me.

1665-04-05 22:04 Creed lay with me; but, being sleepy, he had no mind to talk about business, which indeed I intended, by inviting him to lie with me, but I would not force it on him, and so to bed.

1665-04-05 13:20 Creed and my wife, Mercer and I by coach to take the ayre; and, where we had formerly been, at Hackney, did there eat some pullets we carried with us, and some things of the house; and after a game or two at shuffle-board, home.

1665-04-05 05:50 I betimes with Mr. Tooker, whom I have brought into the Navy to serve us as a husband to see goods timely shipped off from hence to the Fleete and other places, and took him with me to Woolwich and Deptford.

1665-04-04 23:45 To the office, where very late till I was ready to fall down asleep, and did several times nod in the middle of my letters.

1665-04-04 12:58 I bespoke some bands of her, intending to make her my seamstress, she being one of the prettiest and most modest looked women that ever I did see.

1665-04-04 12:48 To the ’Change to buy a pair of cotton stockings, which I did at the husband’s shop of the most pretty woman there, who did also invite me to buy some linnen of her, and I was glad of the occasion.

1665-04-03 17:35 All the pleasure of the play was, the King and my Lady Castlemayne were there; and pretty witty Nell, at the King’s house, and the younger Marshall sat next us; which pleased me mightily.

1665-04-03 17:10 With Creed, my wife, and Mercer to a play at the Duke’s, of my Lord Orrery’s, called “Mustapha,” which being not good, made Betterton’s part and Ianthe’s but ordinary too, so that we were not contented with it at all.

1665-04-02 13:03 At my office all the morning, renewing my vowes in writing and then home to dinner.

1665-04-01 23:27 At my office late writing letters till ready to drop down asleep with my late sitting up of late, and running up and down a-days. So to bed.

1665-04-01 17:20 Home, vexed mightily to see how simply our greatest ministers do content themselves to understand and do things, while the King’s service in the meantime lies a-bleeding.

1665-04-01 15:58 But to see how my Lord Treasurer did bless himself, crying he could do no more than he could, nor give more money than he had, if the occasion and expence were never so great, which is but a sad story.

1665-04-01 15:22 With Sir G. Carteret to my Lord Treasurer, and by and by come Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes, and anon we come to my Lord, and there did lay open the expence for the six months past, and an estimate of the seven months to come.
