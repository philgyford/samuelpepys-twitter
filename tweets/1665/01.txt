1665-01-31 17:52   Many high words between my wife and I, but Jane shall go, but I will take a course with the boy, for I have spoiled him already.

1665-01-31 17:27   My wife sent for me, and what was it but to tell me how Jane carries herself, and I must put her away presently.

1665-01-31 09:40   I am vexed to see myself put upon businesses so uncertainly about getting ships for Tangier being ordered, a servile thing.

1665-01-31 06:35   To sleep, very brokenly, all night long, and found all safe in the morning.

1665-01-31 01:50   God preserve us this night safe! I home to my house and, in great fear, to bed, thinking every running of a mouse really a thief.

1665-01-31 00:15   The truth is, my house is mighty dangerous, having so many ways to be come to; but, if I escape to-night, I will remedy it.

1665-01-30 23:40   I remembered that this evening I saw a woman and two men stand suspiciously in the entry, in the darke.

1665-01-30 22:52   Knowing that I have a great sum of money in my house, this puts me into a most mighty affright.

1665-01-30 22:50   Comes Mercer to me, to tell me that my wife desired me to come home; for they hear noises over their head upon the leads.

1665-01-30 11:20   Putting my closett to rights again, having lately put it out of order in removing my books and things in order to being made clean.

1665-01-29 19:55   Mr. Hill and I to supper alone, our discourse upon the particular vain humours of Mr. Povy, which are very extraordinary indeed.

1665-01-28 14:50   I walked to Paul’s Churchyard, but my books not bound, which vexed me.

1665-01-27 19:24   Mrs. Turner did give me a glass of most pure water, and shewed me her Rocke, which is a very noble thing but a very bawble.

1665-01-27 11:45   Jane told me it was her fortune to have this man, though she did believe it would be to her ruine, which is a strange, stupid thing.

1665-01-27 11:23   Faisant ce que je voudrais quant à la toucher; but Jane would not laisser me faire l’autre thing.

1665-01-27 11:10   With Jane at a house looking into the fields there took up and sat an hour or two talking and discoursing.

1665-01-27 09:35   I sent Jane away and by following her to the Exchange, and thence down to the 3 Cranes, and there took boat for the Falcon.

1665-01-27 09:10   I found Jane Welsh come to tell me that she is resolved to stick to this sweetheart of hers, one Harbing (a sorry fellow, and poor).

1665-01-26 21:40   My wife mightily troubled with the tooth ake, and my cold not being gone yet, but my bruise yesterday goes away again.

1665-01-25 22:10   Having by squeezing myself in a coach hurt my testicles, but I hope will cease its pain without swelling. So home out of order.

1665-01-25 19:04   Sir J. Minnes told me what a mad freaking fellow Sir Ellis Layton hath been, and is, and once at Antwerp was really mad.

1665-01-24 21:45   To bed, having a great cold, got on Sunday last, by sitting too long with my head bare, for Mercer to comb my hair and wash my eares.

1665-01-24 11:10   The Dutch have voted no trade to be suffered for eighteen months, but that they apply themselves wholly to the war.

1665-01-23 20:30   I back again to my office, where I did with great content faire a vow to mind my business, and laisser aller les femmes for a month.

1665-01-23 18:22   To my office a little and to Jervas’s again, thinking to avoir rencontré Jane, mais elle n’était pas dedans.

1665-01-23 13:58   But strange to see how a woman, notwithstanding her greatest pretences of love à son mari and religion, may be vaincue.

1665-01-23 13:55   Mrs. Bagwell and I to a cabaret, and there I had her company tout l’après-dîner and had mon plein plaisir of elle.

1665-01-23 11:04   To Jervas’s, my mind, God forgive me, running too much after sa fille, but elle not being within I by coach to the ’Change.

1665-01-22 12:16   I know not how their fortunes may agree, but their disposition and merits are much of a sort, and persons equally acceptable.

1665-01-22 12:15   In my wife’s chamber dined very merry discoursing of a design of making a match between Mrs. Betty Pickering and Mr. Hill, the merchant.

1665-01-22 02:05   To bed, being now mighty well, and truly I cannot but impute it to my fresh hare’s foote.

1665-01-22 02:00   I sat in my chamber reading of Mr Hooke’s Microscopicall Observations, the most ingenious book that ever I read in my life.

1665-01-21 14:28   I tried the brave echo upon the stairs; which continues a voice so long as the singing three notes, concords, one after another.

1665-01-21 14:09   At Somersett House, Mr. Povy showed me the Queene-Mother’s chamber and closet, most beautiful places for furniture and pictures.

1665-01-20 18:33   I no sooner almost handled Mr. Batten’s hare’s foote but my belly began to be loose and to break wind.

1665-01-20 18:32   Mr Batten showed me my mistake that my hare’s foote hath not the joynt to it; he never had his cholique since he carried it about him.

1665-01-20 15:28   To my bookseller’s, and there took home Hooke’s book of microscopy, a most excellent piece, and of which I am very proud.

1665-01-20 12:55   To the Swan, and sent for a bit of meat and dined, and had my baiser of the fille of the house there, but nothing plus.

1665-01-20 10:12   I at last got them to suffer me to advise privately, and by that means had Jane’s company and think I shall meet her.

1665-01-20 09:44   I to Jervas and I find them in great disorder. Jane had made herself sure to a fellow that can only fiddle for his living.

1665-01-19 20:48   I am so sleepy I cannot hold open my eyes, and therefore must be forced to break off this day’s passages more shortly than I should.

1665-01-19 20:10   Dr. Tom Pepys is dead for which I am but little sorry; he would have been a shame to his family and profession; he was such a coxcomb.

1665-01-19 07:10   It being yesterday and to-day a great thaw it is not for a man to walk the streets, but took coach.

1665-01-18 20:55   I hard at it very late about Mr. Povy’s accounts, but such accounts I never did see, or hope again to see in my days.

1665-01-18 12:59   I told my Lady I thought Creed was as cunning a man as any in England, and one that I would fear first should outwit me in any thing.

1665-01-18 12:55   My Lady did begin to talk of what she had heard concerning Creed, of his being suspected to be a fanatique and a false fellow.

1665-01-18 08:48   To my bookseller’s, and did give direction for the new binding of a great many of my old books, to make my whole study of the same binding.

1665-01-17 11:32   With Creed to the ’Change and Coffee-house, and so home, where a brave dinner, by having a brace of pheasants and merry about Povy’s folly.

1665-01-17 09:55   It was strange to find myself sit herein Committee with my hat on, while Mr. Sherwin stood bare as a clerke, with his hat off.

1665-01-17 09:40   To see how simply Povy did again confound himself and his business, rendering every body doubtfull of his being either a foole or knave.

1665-01-16 16:15   Secretary Bennet’s letters say that Allen has met with the Dutch Smyrna fleet at Cales, and sunk one and taken three.

1665-01-16 09:44   Ned Pickering tells me how active my Lord is at sea, and that my Lord Hinchingbroke is now at Rome, and a very noble and hopefull gentleman.

1665-01-15 18:10   Lord Fitz Harding fell to discourse of Prince Rupert, to say that his disease was the pox and that he must be fluxed.

1665-01-15 17:50   All ended with a conviction that it was not fit for these Turkey ships to go out, though the ships be loaded.

1665-01-15 16:03   To my Lord Chancellor’s, where by and by Mr. Coventry, Sir W. Pen, Sir J. Lawson, Sir G. Ascue, and myself were called in to the King.

1665-01-15 09:10   Up, and after a little at my office to prepare a fresh draught of my vowes for the next yeare, I to church.

1665-01-14 22:10   To bed, resolving by the grace of God from this day to fall hard to my business again, after some weeke or fortnight’s neglect.

1665-01-14 17:29   With my wife to the King’s house, to see “Vulpone,” a most excellent play; the best I think I ever saw, and well acted.

1665-01-14 11:55   To the ’Change, where our late ill newes confirmed in loss of ships in the Straights, but are now the Phoenix and Nonsuch.

1665-01-13 19:41   To my Lady Batten’s, where I find Pegg Pen, the first time that ever I saw her to wear spots.

1665-01-13 17:15   I walked home, being ill-satisfied with the present actings of the House and prefer the other House before this infinitely.

1665-01-13 16:22   To the King’s house to a play, “The Traytor,” where, unfortunately, I met with Sir W. Pen so that I must be forced to confess it to my wife.

1665-01-13 08:05   He telling me what a character of my judgment, and care, to Tangier he had received of me, that he desired my advice, which he valued.

1665-01-13 08:04   To my Lord Bellasses’s lodgings in Lincolne’s Inne Fieldes, and there he discoursed with me in the most respectfull manner that could be.

1665-01-12 09:44   God preserve us against them, and pardon our making them in our discourse so contemptible an enemy.

1665-01-12 09:42   I spoke with a Frenchman who was taken, but released, by a Dutch man-of-war of thirty-six guns, off the North Foreland, by Margett.

1665-01-11 21:55   By a letter from Plymouth, I hear that two of our ships, the Leopard and another, in the Straights, are lost by running aground.

1665-01-11 21:40   When I come home, I was much troubled to hear my poor canary bird, that I have kept these three or four years, is dead.

1665-01-11 07:35   Up, and very angry with my boy for lying long a bed and forgetting his lute.

1665-01-10 08:55   Lay long, it being still very cold, and then to the office.

1665-01-09 16:06   To a Tangier Committee, where I was complimented by my Lord Bellasses beyond measure I could imagine he would have given any man.

1665-01-09 13:38   To my Lord Crew’s, who receives me with the greatest respect, telling me that he do much doubt of the successe of this warr with Holland.

1665-01-09 10:20   To my barber’s and found occasion to see Jane, but in presence of her mistress, and so could not speak of her failing me yesterday.

1665-01-09 08:29   I walked to White Hall, and in my way saw a woman that broke her thigh, in her heels slipping up upon the frosty streete.

1665-01-08 17:35   I spent the whole afternoon walking into the Church and Abbey, and up and down, but could not find Jane.

1665-01-08 14:38   To the house where Jane Welsh had appointed me but it being sermon time they would not let me in and said nobody was there to speak with me.

1665-01-08 09:04   To the Chappell, where a brave anthem upon the 150 Psalm, where upon the word “trumpet” very good musique was made.

1665-01-07 12:35   Dined alone, my wife and family most of them a-bed.

1665-01-06 20:28   Home, being twelfenight, and chose my piece of cake, but went up to my viall, leaving my wife and people at their sports.

1665-01-06 14:20   I pretty well reconciled to my wife, because she had designed much mirthe to-day to end Christmas with among her servants.

1665-01-06 09:06   A very good mayde Jane is and fully to my mind, being neat, only they say a little apt to scold, but I hear her not.

1665-01-06 09:04   Lay long in bed, but most of it angry and scolding with my wife about her warning Jane our cookemayde to be gone.

1665-01-05 12:25   Troubled at my wife’s being angry with Jane, our cook mayde (a good servant, though hath faults), and given her warning to be gone.

1665-01-04 18:30   I find myself in cold weather to begin to burn within and pimples and pricks all over my body, my pores with cold being shut up.

1665-01-04 17:15   Mr. Moore and I to “Love in a Tubb,” which is very merry, but only so by gesture, not wit at all, which methinks is beneath the House.

1665-01-04 10:12   To my Lord of Oxford’s but his Lordshipp was in bed at past ten o’clock: and, Lord helpe us! so rude a dirty family I never saw in my life.

1665-01-04 02:12   To my office, where late, and then home to supper and to bed but sat up with my wife at cards till past two in the morning.

1665-01-03 19:20   To Sir W. Batten’s, who is going to Harwich to-morrow to set up a light-house there, which he hath got a patent from the King to set up.

1665-01-03 10:30   To the Coffee-house where certain newes that the Dutch have taken some of our colliers to the North; some say four, some say seven.

1665-01-03 08:55   Up, and by coach to Sir Ph. Warwicke’s, the streete being full of footballs, it being a great frost.

1665-01-02 19:55   I was vexed to have a dog brought to my house to lime our little bitch, which they make him do in all their sights.

1665-01-02 19:10   Home, where thinking to be merry was vexed with my wife’s having looked out a letter in Sir Philip Sidney about jealousy for me to read.

1665-01-02 15:08   To my bookseller’s and at his binder’s saw Hooke’s book of the Microscope, which is so pretty that I presently bespoke it.

1665-01-02 12:20   To my Lord Brunker’s, by appointment, in the Piazza, in Covent-Guarding; where I occasioned much mirth with a ballet I brought with me.

1665-01-02 11:36   I did ce que je voudrais avec her most freely and it having cost 2s in wine and cake upon her, I away sick of her impudence.

1665-01-02 11:35   To Mrs. Martin’s lodgings which she has now taken to lie in, in Bow Streete, pitiful poor things, yet she thinks them pretty.

1665-01-02 10:25   To the Swan, and there did sport with Herbert’s young kinswoman without hurt, though they being abroad, the old people.

1665-01-02 09:33   Jane did tell me a place where I might come to her, but to see how modestly and harmlessly she brought it out was very pretty.

1665-01-02 09:32   I to my barber’s, Gervas, and there had a little opportunity of speaking with my Jane alone, and did give her something.

1665-01-01 21:52   Upon my accounts, but have not brought them to order yet, and very intricate I find it.

1665-01-01 12:12   A good venison pasty and a turkey to ourselves, a thing unusuall for so small a family of my condition: but we did it and were very merry.

1665-01-01 09:20   I am dividing my expense, to see what my clothes and every particular hath stood me in: I mean all the branches of my expense.

1665-01-01 01:02   I kissed my wife in the kitchen by the fireside, wishing her a merry new year, observing that I was the first proper wisher of it this year.

1665-01-01 00:04   I find myself, by the great blessing of God, worth 1349l. The Lord make me for ever thankful to his holy name for it!
