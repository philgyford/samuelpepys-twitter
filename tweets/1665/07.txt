1665-07-31 22:52 Proctor the vintner of the Miter in Wood-street, and his son, are dead this morning there, of the plague; he having laid out abundance of money there, and was the greatest vintner for some time in London for great entertainments.

1665-07-31 22:44 Thus we end this month after the greatest glut of content that ever I had; only under some difficulty because of the plague, which grows mightily upon us, the last week being about 1700 or 1800 of the plague.

1665-07-31 22:10 The modesty and gravity of this business was so decent, that it was to me indeed ten times more delightful than if it had been twenty times more merry and joviall.

1665-07-31 21:56 I kissed the bride in bed, and so the curtaines drawne with the greatest gravity that could be, and so good night.

1665-07-31 21:48 I got into the bridegroom’s chamber while he undressed himself, and there was very merry, till he was called to the bride’s chamber, and into bed they went.

1665-07-31 21:05 To supper, and so to talk; and which, methought, was the most extraordinary thing, all of us to prayers as usual, and the young bride and bridegroom too.

1665-07-31 14:32 So to dinner, and very merry we were; but yet in such a sober way as never almost any wedding was in so great families: but it was much better.

1665-07-31 13:07 When we come, hearing it was well done: they being both in their old cloaths; my Lord Crew giving her, there being three coach fulls of them.

1665-07-31 10:12 Fearing the canonicall hour would be past before we got thither, did with a great deal of unwillingness send away the license and wedding ring.

1665-07-31 09:27 We were fain to stay there in the unlucky Isle of Doggs, in a chill place, the morning cool, and wind fresh, above two if not three hours to our great discontent.

1665-07-31 06:52 By water to the Ferry, where, when we come, no coach there; and tide of ebb so far spent as the horse-boat could not get off on the other side the river to bring away the coach.

1665-07-31 06:04 At Deptford, and there find Sir G. Carteret, and my Lady ready to go: I being in my new coloured silk suit, and coat trimmed with gold buttons and gold broad lace round my hands, very rich and fine.

1665-07-30 21:30 I to bed, being to rise betimes tomorrow to go to the wedding at Dagenhams.

1665-07-30 21:15 It was a sad noise to hear our bell to toll and ring so often to-day, either for deaths or burials; I think five or six times.

1665-07-30 20:35 Will was with me to-day, and is very well again.

1665-07-30 20:27 In my night gown, cap and neckcloth, undressed all day long, lost not a minute, but in my chamber, setting my Tangier accounts to rights.

1665-07-29 21:50 To bed, in some ease of mind that Will is gone to his lodging, and that he is likely to do well, it being only the headake.

1665-07-29 16:39 At last he yielded Kate should go to Windsor, to some friends there.

1665-07-29 16:37 I to Kate Joyce’s, and there used all the vehemence and rhetorique I could to get her husband to let her go down to Brampton, but I could not prevail with him; he urging some simple reasons, but most that of profit, minding the house, and the distance.

1665-07-29 14:02 I went forth to the Old Exchange to pay my fair Batelier for some linen, and took leave of her, they breaking up shop for a while.

1665-07-29 12:15 I hear that my Will is come in thither and laid down upon my bed, ill of the headake, which put me into extraordinary fear.

1665-07-29 05:56 Up betimes, and after viewing some of my wife’s pictures, which now she is come to do very finely to my great satisfaction beyond what I could ever look for, I went away and by water to the office.

1665-07-28 21:50 Took coach again and home with great pleasure, and thence I down to Woolwich, where find my wife well, and after drinking and talking a little we to bed.

1665-07-28 14:35 The chaplain, with whom but a week or two ago we were here mighty high disputing, is since fallen into a fever and dead, being gone hence to a friend’s a good way off. A sober and a healthful man.

1665-07-28 14:33 But, Lord! to see in what fear all the people here do live would make one mad, they are afeard of us that come to them, insomuch that I am troubled at it, and wish myself away.

1665-07-28 11:49 Set out with my Lady all alone with her with six horses to Dagenhams; going by water to the Ferry. And a pleasant going, and good discourse; and when there, very merry, and the young couple now well acquainted.

1665-07-28 06:07 Sir G. Carteret is much displeased with the order of our officers yesterday to remove the office to Deptford. I am glad I was not at the order making, and so I will endeavour to alter it.

1665-07-27 19:26 At home met the weekly Bill, where above 1000 encreased in the Bill, and of them, in all about 100 of the plague, which hath made the officers this day resolve of sitting at Deptford, which puts me to some consideration what to do.

1665-07-27 09:32 It was pretty to see the young pretty ladies dressed like men, in velvet coats, caps with ribbands, and with laced bands, just like men. Only the Duchesse herself it did not become.

1665-07-27 09:07 We saw the King and Queene set out toward Salisbury, and after them the Duke and Duchesse, whose hands I did kiss. It was the first time I did ever, or did see any body else, kiss her hand, and it was a most fine white and fat hand.

1665-07-26 21:51 The sicknesse is got into our parish this week, and is got, indeed, every where; so that I begin to think of setting things in order, which I pray God enable me to put both as to soul and body.

1665-07-26 20:04 I to the Exchange, where I went up and sat talking with my beauty, Mrs. Batelier, a great while, who is indeed one of the finest women I ever saw in my life.

1665-07-26 18:55 A little other discourse and the sad news of the death of so many in the parish of the plague, forty last night, the bell always going.

1665-07-26 18:48 I spoke with Anthony Joyce, who tells me he likes well of my proposal for Pall to Harman, but I fear that less than 500l. will not be taken, and that I shall not be able to give.

1665-07-26 17:03 The Duke of Monmouth is the most skittish leaping gallant that ever I saw, always in action, vaulting or leaping, or clambering.

1665-07-26 16:07 God forgive me! though I admire the King and the Duke with all the duty possible, yet the more a man considers and observes them, the less he finds of difference between them and other men.

1665-07-26 15:24 The King come down, and I went in the barge with him, I sitting at the door. Down to Woolwich (and there I just saw and kissed my wife, and saw some of her painting, which is very curious; and away again to the King).

1665-07-26 13:40 I walked with Mr. Castle, who told me the design of Ford and Rider to do all the hurt they can to Captain Taylor in his new ship “The London,” and that they are a couple of false persons, which I believe, and withal that he himself is a knave too.

1665-07-26 13:06 All to dinner and sat down to the King saving myself, which, though I could not in modesty expect, yet, God forgive my pride! I was sorry that Sir W. Batten should say that he could sit down where I could not, but this was my pride and folly.

1665-07-26 09:28 I to Greenwich to the Park, where I hear the King and Duke are come by water this morn from Hampton Court. They asked me several questions. The King mightily pleased with his new buildings there.

1665-07-25 20:04 These two or three days Mr. Shaw at Alderman Backewell’s hath lain sick, like to die, and is feared will not live a day to an end.

1665-07-25 16:24 By coach to the Duke of Albemarle’s, not meeting one coach going nor coming from my house thither and back again, which is very strange.

1665-07-25 13:42 Sad the story of the plague in the City, it growing mightily. This day my Lord Bruncker did give me Mr. Grant’s book upon the Bills of Mortality, new printed and enlarged.

1665-07-25 07:55 Our good humour in every body continuing, and there I slept till seven o’clock. Then up and to the office, well refreshed.

1665-07-25 06:03 We slept till daylight, and then some victuals and wine being brought us, we ate a bit, and so up and took boat, merry as might be; and when come to Sir G. Carteret’s, there all to bed.

1665-07-25 00:56 Oares was called from the other side at Greenwich; but, when it come, a frolic, being mighty merry, took us, and there we would sleep all night in the coach in the Isle of Doggs.

1665-07-24 23:03 It grew dark, so as we doubted the losing of our way; and a long time it was, or seemed, before we could get to the water-side, where, when we come, all merry, we found no ferryboat.

1665-07-24 19:05 We took coach again; but, Lord! to see in what a pleasant humour Sir G. Carteret hath been both coming and going; so light, so fond, so merry, so boyish, it is one of the greatest wonders I ever saw in my mind.

1665-07-24 18:10 Here with great content all the day, as I think I ever passed a day in my life, because of the contentfulness of our errand, and the nobleness of the company and our manner of going.

1665-07-24 16:55 We were bravely entertained and spent the day most pleasantly with the young ladies, and I so merry as never more.

1665-07-24 14:13 I find Mr. Carteret yet as backward almost in his caresses, as he was the first day.

1665-07-24 07:02 By and by went over to the ferry, and took coach and six horses nobly for Dagenhams, himself and lady and their little daughter, Louisonne, and myself in the coach.

1665-07-24 06:32 Up and home, and there dressed myself, and by appointment to Deptford, to Sir G. Carteret’s, where I found him and my Lady almost ready.

1665-07-24 01:58 After eating a bit at a neat inne, which pleased me well, I took boat, and slept all the way, without intermission, from thence to Queenhive.

1665-07-23 22:10 I was forced with great trouble to walk up and down looking of Cutler, and at last forced to get a boat to carry me to Kingston.

1665-07-23 20:07 When I got free and come to look for Cutler, he was gone with his coach, without leaving any word with any body to tell me so.

1665-07-23 11:32 I followed the King to chapel, and there hear a good sermon; and after sermon with my Lord Arlington, Sir Thomas Ingram and others, spoke to the Duke about Tangier, but not to much purpose.

1665-07-23 08:58 Mr. Cutler is a man, that though I think he be a knave, as the world thinks him, yet a man of great experience and worthy to be heard discourse.

1665-07-23 08:55 Up very betimes, called by Mr. Cutler, by appointment, and with him in his coach and four horses over London Bridge to Kingston, a very pleasant journey, and at Hampton Court by nine o’clock.

1665-07-22 18:12 I to Fox-hall, where to the Spring garden; but I do not see one guest there, the town being so empty of any body to come thither.

1665-07-22 15:50 I by water to Westminster, and the Duke of Albemarle being gone to dinner to my Lord of Canterbury’s, I thither, and there walked and viewed the new hall, a new old-fashion hall as much as possible.

1665-07-21 23:06 Home and late at my chamber, setting some papers in order; the plague growing very raging, and my apprehensions of it great.

1665-07-21 17:27 To Anthony Joyce’s, and there broke to him my desire to have Pall married to Harman, whose wife, poor woman, is lately dead, to my trouble, I loving her very much, and he will consider it.

1665-07-20 21:10 But, Lord! to see how the plague spreads. It being now all over King’s Street, at the Axe, and next door to it, and in other places.

1665-07-20 16:15 To Redriffe, where I hear the sickness is, and indeed is scattered almost every where, there dying 1089 of the plague this week.

1665-07-20 13:10 To Mrs. Croft’s, where I found and saluted Mrs. Burrows, who is a very pretty woman for a mother of so many children.

1665-07-19 23:31 I had un design pour aller à la femme de Bagwell and did so, mais ne savais obtener algún cosa de ella como jo quisiere sino tocarla.

1665-07-19 19:21 I down by water to Deptford, where I find all full of joy, and preparing to go to Dagenhams to-morrow.

1665-07-19 13:52 To the Exchequer, and there with much trouble got my tallies, and afterwards took Mr. Falconer, Spicer, and another or two to the Leg and there give them a dinner.

1665-07-18 21:07 I was much troubled this day to hear at Westminster how the officers do bury the dead in the open Tuttle-fields, pretending want of room elsewhere.

1665-07-18 19:22 By water to my wife, whom I have not seen 6 or 5 days, and there supped with her, and mighty pleasant, and saw with content her drawings.

1665-07-18 15:21 To Westminster Hall, and there paid for my news-books, and did give Mrs. Michell, who is going out of town because of the sickness, and her husband, a pint of wine.

1665-07-17 16:32 But, Lord! to see how all these great people here are afeard of London, being doubtful of anything that comes from thence, or that hath lately been there, that I was forced to say that I lived wholly at Woolwich.

1665-07-17 16:10 I took my Lady Jem apart, and would know how she liked this gentleman. She blushed, and hid her face awhile; but at last I forced her to tell me. She answered that she could readily obey what her father and mother had done; which was all she could say, or I expect.

1665-07-17 14:49 After dinner Mr. Carteret took my advice about giving to the servants, and I led him to give 10l. among them, which he did, by leaving it to the chief man-servant, Mr. Medows, to do for him.

1665-07-16 16:20 They together an hour, and by and by church-time, whither Mr. Carteret led her into the coach and into the church, and so at church all the afternoon. But it was most extraordinary hot that ever I knew it.

1665-07-16 12:16 Back again by coach, Mr. Carteret having not had the confidence to take his lady once by the hand, coming or going, which I told him of when we come home, and he will hereafter do it.

1665-07-16 11:32 And so by coaches to church four miles off; where a pretty good sermon, and a declaration of penitence of a man that had undergone the Church censure for his wicked life.

1665-07-16 10:04 I taught Mr. Carteret what to do: to take the lady always by the hand to lead her, and telling him that I would find opportunity to leave them two together, he should make these and these compliments.

1665-07-15 22:18 I staid a little, to know how Mr. Carteret liked the lady, which he told me he did mightily; but, Lord! in the dullest insipid manner that ever lover did.

1665-07-15 20:11 My Lord Crew discoursing with Mr. Carteret, asking of him questions of travell, which he answered well enough in a few words; but nothing to the lady from him at all.

1665-07-15 17:49 But, Lord! what silly discourse we had by the way as to love-matters, Mr. Carteret being the most awkerd man I ever met with in my life as to that business.

1665-07-15 15:03 Took boat, Mr. Carteret and I to the ferry-place at Greenwich, and there staid an hour crossing the water to and again to get our coach and horses over, and so toward Dagenhams.

1665-07-15 12:12 Before I went out of the office, a great lady, as to fine clothes, did attend there to have a ticket signed; which I did do, taking her through the garden to my office, where I signed it and had a salute of her.

1665-07-14 23:47 And so to bed, to be up betimes by the help of a larum watch, which by chance I borrowed of my watchmaker to-day, while my own is mending.

1665-07-14 19:04 I by water to Sir G. Carteret’s, and there find my Lady Sandwich and her buying things for my Lady Jem’s wedding; and my Lady Jem is beyond expectation come to Dagenhams, where Mr. Carteret is to go to visit her to-morrow.

1665-07-14 12:38 Upon the ’Change all the news is that guns have been heard and that news is come by a Dane that my Lord was in view of De Ruter.

1665-07-14 11:50 At the Exchequer endeavouring to strike tallies for money for Tangier, and mightily vexed to see how people attend there, some out of town, and others drowsy, and to others it was late, so that the King’s business suffers ten times more than all their service is worth.

1665-07-13 21:28 Above 700 died of the plague this week.

1665-07-13 16:32 I and wife, who by agreement met here, took leave, and I saw my wife a little way down (it troubling me that this absence makes us a little strange instead of more fond), and so parted.

1665-07-13 14:20 I dined well and mighty merry, especially my Lady Slany and I about eating of creame and brown bread, which she loves as much as I.

1665-07-13 11:00 I by water to Sir G. Carteret’s, but I was fain to call a sculler that had a gentleman already in it, and he proved a man of love to musique, and he and I sung together the way down with great pleasure, and an incident extraordinary to be met with.

1665-07-13 01:10 Away to my boat, and all night upon the water, staying a while with Nan at Moreclacke, very much pleased and merry with her, and so on homeward.

1665-07-12 20:42 I Heard Mr. Williamson repeat at Hampton Court to-day how the King of France hath lately set out a most high arrest against the Pope, which is reckoned very lofty and high.

1665-07-12 19:10 Up the river, against tide all the way, to Hampton Court; and when I come there all business was over, saving my finding Mr. Coventry at his chamber, and with him a good while about several businesses.

1665-07-11 22:44 Away to bed, shifting myself, and taking some Venice treakle, feeling myself out of order, and thence to bed to sleep.

1665-07-11 21:20 And so, weary and sweaty, it being very hot beyond bearing, we back again, and I set Mary down in St. Martin’s Lane.

1665-07-11 18:05 I had Mary meet me at the New Exchange, and there took coach and I with great pleasure took the ayre to Highgate, and thence to Hampstead, much pleased with her company, pretty and innocent, and had what pleasure almost I would with her.

1665-07-11 13:33 By a solemn invitation to the Trinity House, where a great dinner and company, Captain Dobbin’s feast for Elder Brother.

1665-07-11 07:04 I to the Harp and Ball, and there made a bargain with Mary to go forth with me in the afternoon, which she with much ado consented to.

1665-07-11 02:35 All night down by water, a most pleasant passage, and come thither by two o’clock, and so walked from the Old Swan home, and there to bed, being very weary.

1665-07-10 22:44 To Richmond, and there, by night, walked with Mr. Charnocke, Sir Philip Warwicke’s clerk, to Moreclacke, a very pretty walk, and there staid a good while, now and then talking and sporting with Nan the servant.

1665-07-10 17:39 It is, I perceive, an unpleasing thing to be at Court, everybody being fearful one of another, and all so sad, enquiring after the plague, so that I stole away by my horse.

1665-07-10 11:38 Having a coach of Mr. Povy’s attending me, in order to my coming to dine at his country house at Branford, I went, it being a pretty chariot, but most inconvenient as to the horses throwing dust and dirt into one’s eyes and upon one’s clothes.

1665-07-10 07:08 With great pleasure looking over a nest of puppies of Mr. Shelden’s, with which my wife is most extraordinary pleased, and one of them is promised her.

1665-07-09 18:20 In this parish of Michell’s, Cornhill, one of the middlemost parishes and a great one of the town, there hath, notwithstanding this sickliness, been buried of any disease, man, woman, or child, not one for thirteen months last past; which very strange.

1665-07-09 16:39 I, leaving my wife there, took boat and home, and there shifted myself into my black silk suit, and having promised Harman yesterday, I to his house, which I find very mean, and mean company.

1665-07-09 14:48 I took occasion to have much discourse with Mr. Ph. Carteret, and find him a very modest man; and I think verily of mighty good nature, and pretty understanding. He did give me a good account of the fight with the Dutch.

1665-07-09 10:18 It seems my Lady Sandwich’s drinking of the water at Tunbridge did almost kill her before she could with most violent physique get it out of her body again.

1665-07-09 10:10 By water to Sir G. Carteret, and there find my Lady Sandwich in her chamber, not very well, but looks the worst almost that ever I did see her in my life.

1665-07-08 23:50 To Woolwich, and found my wife asleep in bed. I to bed, being the first time I come to her lodgings, and there lodged well.

1665-07-08 22:40 I fitted myself to go down to Woolwich to my wife, which I did, calling at Sir G. Carteret’s at Deptford, and there hear that my Lady Sandwich is come, but not very well.

1665-07-07 08:40 I have two tierces of Claret, two quarter casks of Canary, and a smaller vessel of Sack; a vessel of Tent, another of Malaga, and another of white wine, all in my wine cellar together; which, I believe, none of my friends of my name now alive ever had of his own at one time.

1665-07-07 08:33 Having set my neighbour, Mr. Hudson, wine coopers, at work drawing out a tierce of wine for the sending of some of it to my wife, I abroad.

1665-07-06 16:27 I could not see my Lord Brunkerd, nor had much mind, one of the great houses within two doors of him being shut up: and, Lord! the number of houses visited, which this day I observed through the town, quite round in my way by Long Lane and London Wall.

1665-07-06 14:49 In a little while all must go to wrack, winter coming on apace, when a great sum must be ready to pay part of the fleet, and so far we are from it that we have not enough to stop the mouths of poor people and their hands from falling about our eares here almost in the office.

1665-07-05 23:41 Late home and to bed, very lonely.

1665-07-05 20:10 Grieved in my heart to part with my wife, being worse by much without her, though some trouble there is in having the care of a family at home in this plague time.

1665-07-05 19:38 By water to Woolwich, where I found my wife come, and her two maids, and very prettily accommodated they will be.

1665-07-05 17:45 With Sir G. Carteret to Deptford, talking how matters are quite concluded with all possible content between my Lord and him and signed and sealed, so that my Lady Sandwich is to come thither to-morrow or next day, and the young lady is sent for.

1665-07-05 15:32 I observed a house shut up this day in the Pell Mell, where heretofore in Cromwell’s time we young men used to keep our weekly clubs.

1665-07-04 18:28 The Duke and Prince Rupert are both come back from sea, and neither of them go back again. The latter I much wonder at, but it seems the town reports so, and I am very glad of it.

1665-07-04 14:32 To the Dolphin, where a good dinner at the cost of one Mr. Osbaston, who lost a wager to Sir W. Batten, Sir W. Rider, and Sir R. Ford, a good while since and now it is spent.

1665-07-04 06:03 Mightily troubled in my sleep all night with dreams of Jacke Cole, my old schoolfellow, lately dead, who was born at the same time with me, and we reckoned our fortunes pretty equal.

1665-07-03 20:30 I shall put all my affairs in the world in good order, the season growing so sickly, that it is much to be feared how a man can escape having a share with others in it, for which the good Lord God bless me, or to be fitted to receive it.

1665-07-03 20:15 Resolving from this night forwards to close all my letters, if possible, and end all my business at the office by daylight.

1665-07-03 15:12 To the Swan, and there demeurais un peu de temps con la fille, and so to the Harp and Ball, and alone demeurais un peu de temps besándola, and so away home.

1665-07-02 20:44 Sir J. Lawson was buried late last night at St. Dunstan’s by us, without any company at all, and the condition of his family is but very poor, which I could be contented to be sorry for, though he never was the man that ever obliged me by word or deed.

1665-07-02 16:22 To my accounts and cast them up, and find that though I have spent above 90l. this month yet I have saved 17l, and am worth in all above 1450l, for which the Lord be praised!

1665-07-02 11:55 All the morning dressing my closet at the office with my plates, very neatly, and a fine place now it is, and will be a pleasure to sit in, though I thank God I needed none before.
