1665-12-21 22:39 Mrs. Daniel has provided me a supper of little birds killed by her husband, and I made her sup with me, and after supper were alone a great while, and I had the pleasure of her lips, she being a pretty woman, and one whom a great belly becomes as well as ever I saw any.

1665-12-21 20:50 Home, my head full of business and some trouble for my letting my accounts go so far that I have made an oath this night for the drinking no wine, &c, on such penalties till I have passed my accounts and cleared all.

1665-12-21 17:20 I was come to by Mrs. Burrows, of Westminster, Lieutenant Burrows (lately dead) his wife, a most pretty woman and my old acquaintance; I had a kiss or two of her, and a most modest woman she is.

1665-12-21 13:47 All of us dined at Captain Cocke’s at a good chine of beef, and other good meat; but, being all frost-bitten, was most of it unroast; but very merry, and a good dish of fowl we dressed ourselves.

1665-12-20 23:57 I to bed, exceedingly pleased in all my matters of money this month or two, it having pleased God to bless me with several opportunities of good sums, and that I have them in effect all very well paid, or in my power to have.

1665-12-20 23:29 I away home, and was there sat up for to be spoken with my young Mrs. Daniel, to pray me to speak for her husband to be a Lieutenant. I had the opportunity here of kissing her again and again, and did answer that I would be very willing to do him any kindness.

1665-12-20 22:50 At last, late, I did pray Mrs. Penington to undress herself into her nightgown, that I might see how to have her picture drawn carelessly (for she is mighty proud of that conceit).

1665-12-20 20:36 I to Mrs. Penington, and had a supper from the King’s Head for her, and there mighty merry and free as I used to be with her.

1665-12-20 16:28 I to the Exchange to see whether my pretty seamstress be come again or no, and I find she is, so I to her, saluted her over her counter in the open Exchange above, and mightily joyed to see her, poor pretty woman! I must confess I think her a great beauty.

1665-12-20 13:52 I took Sir Ellis Layton to Captain Cocke’s, where my Lord Bruncker and Lady Williams dine, and we all mighty merry; but Sir Ellis Layton one of the best companions at a meal in the world.

1665-12-20 08:20 Up, and was trimmed, but not time enough to save my Lord Bruncker’s coach or Sir J. Minnes’s, and so was fain to walk to Lambeth on foot, but it was a very fine frosty walk, and great pleasure in it, but troublesome getting over the River for ice.

1665-12-19 22:40 I to my office, where late writing letters and then home to bed.

1665-12-19 13:44 I made mighty much of Hatcham Pepys, but a sorry dull fellow he is, fit for nothing that is ingenious, nor is there a turd of kindness or service to be had from him.

1665-12-18 20:32 Having no mind to do any business, went home to my lodgings, and there got little Mrs. Tooker, and Mrs. Daniel, the daughter, and Sarah to my chamber to cards and sup with me.

1665-12-18 18:10 home by water to Greenwich, the river beginning to be very full of ice, so as I was a little frighted, but got home well, it being darke.

1665-12-18 13:35 Lord! to see how Dr. Hinton come in with a gallant or two from Court, and do so call “Cozen” Mr. Hinton, the goldsmith, but I that know him to be a beggar and a knave, did make great sport in my mind at it.

1665-12-18 11:11 I spied young Mrs. Daniel and Sarah, my landlady’s daughter, who are come to town, and did say they spied me and I dogged them to St. Martin’s, where I passed by them being shy, and walked down as low as Ducke Lane, and so back again and they were gone.

1665-12-18 09:27 I to the ’Change and up and down to Kingdon and the goldsmith’s to meet Mr. Stephens, and did get all my money matters most excellently cleared to my complete satisfaction.

1665-12-18 07:10 To London, and there visited my wife, and was a little displeased to find she is so forward all of a spurt to make much of her brother and sister since my last kindness to him in getting him a place.

1665-12-17 23:44 To Greenwich, to make a short visit to my Lord Bruncker, and next to Mrs. Penington and spent all the evening with her with the same freedom I used to have and very pleasant company.

1665-12-17 17:10 I found Thos. Pepys of Hatcham a dull fellow still in all his discourse, but in this he is ready enough to embrace what I counsel him to.

1665-12-17 13:54 Cutler’s old mother was an object at dinner that made me not like it; and, after dinner, to visit his sick wife I did not also take much joy in, but very friendly he is to me.

1665-12-17 12:22 At Cutler’s house I find him with a plain little dinner, good wine, and welcome. He is still a prating man; and the more I know him, the less I find in him.

1665-12-16 19:32 Lying down close in my boat and, without use of my hand, had great pleasure, and the first time I did make trial of my strength of fancy of that kind without my hand, and had it complete avec la fille que I did see au-jour-dhuy in Westminster Hall.

1665-12-16 17:05 To Westminster Hall, and there I did see Betty Howlet come after the sickness to the Hall. Had not opportunity to salute her, as I desired, but was glad to see her and a very pretty wench she is.

1665-12-15 17:16 Sir James Bunce cried “Ah!” says he, “this is the time for you,” says he, “that were for Oliver heretofore; you are full of employment, and we poor Cavaliers sit still and can get nothing;” which was a pretty reproach, I thought.

1665-12-15 12:07 I spent all the morning with my Surveyors of the Ports for the Victualling, and there read to them what instructions I had provided for them and discoursed largely much of our business and the business of the pursers.

1665-12-14 13:45 I to the Pope’s Head Taverne, and there find Mr. Gawden and Captain Beckford and Nick Osborne going to dinner, and I dined with them and very exceeding merry we were as I had been a great while.

1665-12-13 13:23 Invited by Sheriff Hooker, who keeps the poorest, mean, dirty table in a dirty house that ever I did see any Sheriff of London; and a plain, ordinary, silly man I think he is, but rich.

1665-12-13 11:40 To the ’Change, and there hear the ill news, to my great and all our great trouble, that the plague is encreased again this week, notwithstanding there hath been a day or two great frosts.

1665-12-13 10:15 I did go to Mr. Pierce’s, where he and his wife made me drink some tea, and so he and I by water together to London.

1665-12-12 22:06 In the cold (the weather setting in cold) home to the office and, after my letters being wrote, home to supper and to bed, my wife being also gone to London.

1665-12-12 09:10 To the office, where my Lord Bruncker met, and among other things did finish a contract with Cocke for hemp, by which I hope to get my money due from him paid presently.

1665-12-11 19:52 Temple computes that the whole money of England must be full 6,250,000l. But for all this believes that there is above 30,000,000l.

1665-12-11 19:48 Temple tells me that of the 80,000l. advanced already by the East India Company, they have had 5000l. out of their hands. He discoursed largely of the quantity of money coyned, and what may be thought the real sum of money in the kingdom.

1665-12-10 16:04 Home, and there we sang some things, but not with much pleasure, Mr. Andrews being in so great haste to go home, his wife looking every hour to be brought to bed.

1665-12-10 08:20 Lay long talking, Hill and I, with great pleasure, and then up, and being ready walked to Cocke’s for some news, but heard none.

1665-12-09 21:15 Home to Mr. Hill, and sang, among other things, my song of “Beauty retire,” which he likes, only excepts against two notes in the base, but likes the whole very well.

1665-12-09 06:40 Called up betimes by my Lord Bruncker, who is come to town from his long water worke at Erith last night, to go with him to the Duke of Albemarle, which by his coach I did. Our discourse upon the ill posture of the times through lack of money.

1665-12-09 02:04 Spending the night, till two in the morning, with most complete content as ever in my life, it being increased by my day’s work.

1665-12-08 21:10 A pleasant scene of Mrs. Knipp’s rising sick from table, but whispered me it was for some hard word or other her husband gave her just now when she laughed and was more merry than ordinary.

1665-12-08 20:30 Most excellent musique we had in abundance, and a good supper, dancing.

1665-12-08 19:16 Pierce and his wife, and Rolt, Mrs. Worshipp and her daughter, Coleman and his wife, and Laneare, and, to make us perfectly happy, there comes by chance to towne Mr. Hill to see us.

1665-12-08 19:15 To Greenwich, and there found all my company come; that is, Mrs. Knipp, and an ill, melancholy, jealous-looking fellow, her husband, that spoke not a word to us all the night.

1665-12-08 09:55 I by water to London, to the Navy office, there to give order to my maid to buy things to send down to Greenwich for supper to-night; and I also to buy other things, as oysters, and lemons, 6d. per piece, and oranges, 3d.

1665-12-07 18:20 Spent till night with Mr. Gibson and Hater discoursing and making myself more fully the trade of pursers, and what fittest to be done in their business.

1665-12-07 15:03 Sir G. Carteret’s letter tells me my Lord Sandwich is, as I was told, declared Embassador Extraordinary to Spayne, and to go with all speed away, and that his enemies have done him as much good as he could wish.

1665-12-06 21:46 Knipp is pretty enough; but the most excellent, mad-humoured thing, and sings the noblest that ever I heard in my life, and Rolt, with her, some things together most excellently. I spent the night in ectasy almost.

1665-12-06 19:10 Here the best company for musique I ever was in, in my life, and wish I could live and die in it, both for music and the face of Mrs. Pierce, and my wife and Knipp.

1665-12-06 17:04 I spent the afternoon upon a song of Solyman’s words to Roxalana that I have set.

1665-12-06 08:03 The Duke of Albemarle surprises me with the news that my Lord Sandwich goes Embassador to Spayne speedily; though I know not whence this arises, yet I am heartily glad of it.

1665-12-05 12:15 Empty, yet without stomach to dinner, having spoiled myself with fasting yesterday, and so filled with wind.

1665-12-05 02:27 At Greenwich went and sat with Madam Penington, con laquelle je faisais almost whatever je voudrais – con mi mano, sino tocar la chose même; and I was very near it, and made her undress her head and sit dishevilled all night, sporting.

1665-12-04 13:40 My recommending of my my wife’s brother hath, by the Duke of Albermarle’s and Sir Philip Howard’s direction, to be put as a right-hand man, and other marks of special respect, at which I am very glad.

1665-12-04 12:32 After the observing (God forgive me!) one or two of my neighbour hermosa mohers come to town, which did please me very well, home to my house at the office, where my wife had got a dinner for me: and it was a joyfull thing for us to meet here, for which God be praised!

1665-12-03 22:14 So to bed.

1665-12-03 21:40 I stand admiring of the wittiness of Mrs. Pierce’s little boy, which is one of the wittiest boys, but most confident that ever I did see of a child of 9 years old or under in all my life, or indeed one twice his age almost, but all for roguish wit.

1665-12-03 19:20 By agreement I fetched Mrs. Pierce with Cocke’s coach, and he come and we sat and talked together, thinking to have had Mrs. Coleman and my songsters, her husband and Laneare, but they failed me.

1665-12-02 17:03 It is pretty to reflect how much I am out of confidence with what I had done upon Gibson’s discourse with me, for fear I should have done it sillily, but Poynter likes them, and Mr. Hater also, but yet I am afeard lest they should do it out of flattery.

1665-12-02 12:58 Dined with my wife and took leave of her, she being to go to London for altogether, and I to the office.

1665-12-02 02:38 We had our neighbours, little Miss Tooker and Mrs. Daniels, to dance, and after supper I to bed, and left them merry below, which they did not part from till two or three in the morning.

1665-12-01 20:22 Had long discourse with Gibson who makes me understand so much of the victualling business and the pursers’ trade, that I am ashamed I should go about the concerning myself in a business which I understand so very very little of.
