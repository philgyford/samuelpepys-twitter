1665-09-30 22:12 I may say that these last three months, for joy, health, and profit, have been much the greatest that ever I received in all my life, having nothing upon me but the consideration of the sickliness of the season during this great plague to mortify mee.

1665-09-30 20:40 I to my wife, and there to my great trouble find my wife out of order, and she took me downstairs and there alone did tell me her falling out with both her maids and particularly Mary.

1665-09-30 14:20 I was set upon by the poor wretches, whom I did give good words and some money to, and the poor people went away like lambs, and in good earnest are not to be censured if their necessities drive them to bad courses of stealing or the like, while they lack wherewith to live.

1665-09-30 12:10 The great burden we have upon us at this time at the office, is the providing for prisoners and sick men that are recovered, they lying before our office doors all night and all day, poor wretches.

1665-09-29 20:55 Comes Captain Cocke, and after a great deal of discourse with him seriously upon the disorders of our state through lack of men to mind the public business and to understand it, we broke up, sitting up talking very late.

1665-09-29 18:23 I hear for certain upon the road that Sir Martin Noell is this day dead of the plague in London, where he hath lain sick of it these eight days.

1665-09-29 05:35 I had my horse I borrowed of Mr. Gillthropp, Sir W. Batten’s clerke, brought to me, and so we set out and rode hard and was at Nonsuch by about eight o’clock, a very fine journey and a fine day.

1665-09-29 01:20 I was mightily troubled with a looseness, and feeling for a chamber-pott, there was none, I having called the maid up out of her bed, she had forgot I suppose to put one there; so I was forced in this strange house to rise and shit in the chimney twice.

1665-09-28 09:15 Up, and being mightily pleased with my night’s lodging, drank a cup of beer, and went out to my office, and there did some business.

1665-09-27 11:32 I had most excellent discourse of Mr. Evelyn touching all manner of learning; wherein I find him a very fine gentleman, and particularly of paynting.

1665-09-27 08:50 To the King’s Head, the great musique house, and had a good breakfast, and thence parted, I being much troubled to hear from Creed, that he was told at Salsbury that I am come to be a great swearer and drinker, though I know the contrary.

1665-09-27 07:10 By water to Greenwich and there my Lord told me that he would give me 100l. for my pains, which pleased me well, though Creed, like a cunning rogue, hath got a promise of half of it from me.

1665-09-27 05:45 Up, and saw and admired my wife’s picture of our Saviour, now finished, which is very pretty.

1665-09-26 13:10 I to dinner with Mr. Wright to his father-in-law in Greenwich, one of the most silly, harmless, prating old men that ever I heard in my life.

1665-09-25 20:45 Took our wherry toward Chatham; but, it growing dark, we were put to great difficultys, our simple, yet confident waterman, not knowing a step of the way; and we found ourselves to go backward and forward, which, in the dark night and a wild place, did vex us mightily.

1665-09-25 08:50 Aboard the Prince; and there, after a good while in discourse, we did agree a bargain of 5,000l. with Sir Roger Cuttance for my Lord Sandwich for silk, cinnamon, nutmeggs, and indigo.

1665-09-24 21:45 In this sad time of the plague every thing else has conspired to my happiness and pleasure more for these last three months than in all my life before in so little time. God long preserve it and make me thankful for it!

1665-09-24 08:00 Lord! to see how silly these men are in the selling of it, and easily to be persuaded almost to anything, offering a bag to us to pass as 20 lbs. of cloves, which upon weighing proved 25 lbs.

1665-09-24 07:57 To a blind alehouse at the further end wretched dirty seamen, who, of the town to a couple of poor wretches, had got together about 37 lb. of cloves and to 10 of nutmeggs, and we bought them of them, the first at 5s. 6d. per lb. and the latter at 4s.; and paid them in gold.

1665-09-24 06:45 Being about Grayes, and a very calme, curious morning, we took our wherry, and to the fishermen, and bought a great deal of fine fish, and to Gravesend to White’s, and had part of it dressed.

1665-09-23 23:05 With Captain Cocke set out in the yacht about ten o’clock at night, and after some discourse, and drinking a little, my mind full of what we are going about and jealous of Cocke’s outdoing me – so to sleep.

1665-09-23 13:22 My Lord Craven did speak publiquely of me to the Duke, in the hearing of all the rest; and the Duke did say something of the like advantage to me; I believe, not much to the satisfaction of my brethren; but I was mightily joyed at it.

1665-09-23 06:50 To my Lord Sandwich, who did advise alone with me how far he might trust Captain Cocke in the business of the prize-goods, my Lord telling me that he hath taken into his hands 2 or 3000l. value of them.

1665-09-22 21:20 Captain Herbert did mighty seriously inquire after who was that in the black dress with my wife yesterday, and would not believe that it was my wife’s maid, Mercer, but it was she.

1665-09-22 10:14 And a yew tree he showed us (upon which, he says, the very ivy was taken up whole about it), which upon cutting with an addes, we found to be rather harder than the living tree usually is.

1665-09-22 10:10 It is observable what Johnson tells us, that in digging his late Docke, he did 12 foot under ground find perfect trees over-covered with earth. Nut trees, with the branches and the very nuts upon them.

1665-09-22 06:05 To Blackwall, there to look after the storehouses in order to the laying of goods out of the East India ships when they shall be unloaden.

1665-09-21 22:04 All my work this day in the coach going and coming was to refresh myself in my musique scale, which I would fain have perfecter than ever I had yet.

1665-09-21 13:50 Strange to see how young W. Bowyer looks at 41 years; one would not take him for 24 or more, and is one of the greatest wonders I ever did see.

1665-09-21 11:20 A great walk of an elme and a walnutt set one after another in order. And all the house on the outside filled with figures of stories, and good painting of Rubens’ or Holben’s doing.

1665-09-21 11:10 I to a town near by, Yowell, there drink and set up my horses and also bespoke a dinner, and while that is dressing went with Spicer and walked up and down the house and park; and a fine place it hath heretofore been, and a fine prospect about the house.

1665-09-21 07:04 My Lord’s coach comes for me; and taking Will Hewer with me, who is all in mourning for his father, who is lately dead of the plague, as my boy Tom’s is also, I set out.

1665-09-20 14:32 After dinner I to the office there to write letters, to fit myself for a journey to-morrow to Nonsuch to the Exchequer by appointment.

1665-09-20 10:15 The Duke showed us the number of the plague this week, brought in the last night from the Lord Mayor; that it is encreased about 600 more than the last, which is quite contrary to all our hopes and expectations, from the coldness of the late season.

1665-09-20 09:20 But, Lord! what a sad time it is to see no boats upon the River; and grass grows all up and down White Hall court, and nobody but poor wretches in the streets!

1665-09-19 10:03 To bed I went and slept till 10 of the clock and then comes Captain Cocke to wake me and tell me that his boy was well again.

1665-09-19 04:27 We come to Greenwich, and, having first set down my Lord Bruncker, Cocke and I went to his house, it being light, and there to our great trouble, we being sleepy and cold, we met with the ill news that his boy Jacke was gone to bed sick.

1665-09-18 17:40 No sooner come into the yacht, though overjoyed with the good work we have done to-day, but I was overcome with sea sickness so that I begun to spue soundly, till at last I went into the cabbin and shutting my eyes my trouble did cease that I fell asleep.

1665-09-18 15:20 I hear that W. Howe will grow very rich by this last business and grows very proud and insolent by it; but it is what I ever expected.

1665-09-18 15:07 Great spoil, I hear, there hath been of the two East India ships, and that yet they will come in to the King very rich: so that I hope this journey will be worth 100l. to me.

1665-09-18 13:27 Only Sir W. Pen staid to dine there, but the wind being high the ship (though the motion of it was hardly discernible to the eye) did make me sick, so as I could not eat any thing almost.

1665-09-18 10:45 I saw how the government and management of the greatest business of the three nations is committed to very ordinary heads, saving my Lord, who is able to do what he pleases with them, they not having the meanest degree of reason to be able to oppose anything that he says.

1665-09-18 09:32 By and by was called a Council of Warr on board, when come Sir W. Pen there, and Sir Christopher Mings, Sir Edward Spragg, Sir Jos. Jordan, Sir Thomas Teddiman, and Sir Roger Cuttance, and so the necessity of the fleet for victuals, clothes, and money was discoursed.

1665-09-18 08:50 My Lord received us kindly; telling us the state of the fleet, lacking provisions, having no beer at all, nor have had most of them these three weeks or month, and but few days’ dry provisions.

1665-09-18 07:05 They flung out a rope to us from the Prince and so come on board, but with great trouble and time and patience, it being very cold; we find my Lord Sandwich newly up in his night-gown very well.

1665-09-18 06:10 By break of day we come to within sight of the fleet, which was a very fine thing to behold, being above 100 ships, great and small; with the flag-ships of each squadron, distinguished by their several flags on their main, fore, or mizen masts.

1665-09-17 21:50 We supped and talked, and with much pleasure at last settled ourselves to sleep having very good lodging upon cushions in the cabbin.

1665-09-17 20:25 I walked to Woolwich to trim and shift myself, and by the time I was ready they come down in the Bezan yacht, and so I aboard and my boy Tom, and there very merrily we sailed to below Gravesend, and there come to anchor for all night.

1665-09-17 12:55 This did put me upon a desire of going thither; and, moving of it to my Lord, we presently agreed upon it to go this very tide, we two and Captain Cocke.

1665-09-17 12:52 Comes Sir J. Minnes from the fleet, like a simple weak man, having nothing to say of what he hath done there, but tells of what value he imagines the prizes to be.

1665-09-17 08:13 The barber offered to come this day after dinner with his violin to play me a set of Lyra-ayres upon it, which I was glad of, hoping to be merry thereby.

1665-09-17 06:20 Before I went out of my chamber did draw a musique scale, in order to my having it at any time ready in my hand to turn to for exercise, for I have a great mind in this vacation to perfect myself in my scale.

1665-09-16 16:12 To the office, and there to my business; but find myself, through the unfitness of my place to write in, and my coming from great dinners, and drinking wine, that I am not in the good temper of doing business now a days that I used to be and ought still to be.

1665-09-16 13:32 To dinner to my Lord Bruncker, where Sir W. Batten and his Lady come, by invitation, and very merry we were, only that the discourse of the likelihood of the increase of the plague this week makes us a little sad, but then again the thoughts of the late prizes make us glad.

1665-09-16 08:05 To the office, where I find Sir J. Minnes gone to the fleet, like a doting fool, to do no good, but proclaim himself an asse; for no service he can do there.

1665-09-15 21:04 I in much pain to think what I shall do this winter time; for go every day to Woolwich I cannot, without endangering my life; and staying from my wife at Greenwich is not handsome.

1665-09-15 18:04 With Captain Cocke, and there drank a cup of good drink, which I am fain to allow myself during this plague time, by advice of all, and not contrary to my oath, my physician being dead, and chyrurgeon out of the way, whose advice I am obliged to take.

1665-09-15 16:56 To see how Sir W. Warren do, who is sick, and for which I have reason to be very sorry, he being the friend I have got most by of most friends in England but the King: who returns me that he is pretty well again, his disease being an ague.

1665-09-15 12:50 I got the messenger, Marlow, to get me a piece of bread and butter and cheese and a bottle of beer and ale, and so I went not out of the office but dined off that.

1665-09-14 21:17 To hear that Mr. Lewes hath another daughter sick. And, lastly, that both my servants, W. Hewer and Tom Edwards, have lost their fathers, both in St. Sepulchre’s parish, of the plague this week, do put me into great apprehensions of melancholy.

1665-09-14 21:15 To hear that poor Payne, my waiter, hath buried a child, and is dying himself. To hear that a labourer I sent but the other day to Dagenhams, to know how they did there, is dead of the plague.

1665-09-14 21:13 My finding the Angell tavern, at the lower end of Tower-hill, shut up, and more than that, the alehouse at the Tower-stairs, and more than that, the person was then dying of the plague when I was last there.

1665-09-14 21:11 On the other side, my meeting dead corpses of the plague, carried to be buried close to me at noon-day through the City in Fanchurch-street. To see a person sick of the sores, carried close by me by Gracechurch in a hackney-coach.

1665-09-14 21:09 For the first; the finding of my money and plate, and all safe at London, and speeding in my business of money this day.

1665-09-14 21:07 When I come home I spent some thoughts upon the occurrences of this day, giving matter for as much content on one hand and melancholy on another, as any day in all my life.

1665-09-14 11:42 I away back again to the Bear at the Bridge foot, being full of wind and out of order, and there called for a biscuit and a piece of cheese and gill of sack, being forced to walk over the Bridge, toward the ’Change, and the plague being all thereabouts.

1665-09-14 09:20 To the Duke of Albemarle, where I find a letter from my Lord Sandwich, of the fleete’s meeting with about eighteen more of the Dutch fleete, and his taking of most of them, which is so great a cause of joy in us all that my Lord and everybody is highly joyed thereat.

1665-09-14 07:03 Letters are just now brought from the fleete of our taking a great many more of the Dutch fleete, in which I did never more plainly see my command of my temper in my not admitting myself to receive any kind of joy from it till I had heard the certainty of it.

1665-09-13 21:21 Mr. Pen and I fell to discourse about some words in a French song my wife was saying, “D’un air tout interdict,” wherein I laid twenty to one against him which he would not agree with me, though I know myself in the right as to the sense of the word.

1665-09-13 14:50 Sir W. Hickes did give us the meanest dinner (of beef, shoulder and umbles of venison which he takes away from the keeper of the Forest, and a few pigeons, and all in the meanest manner) that ever I did see, to the basest degree.

1665-09-13 12:30 Not so much as a latch to his dining-room door; which saved him nothing, for the wind blowing into the room for want thereof, flung down a great bow pott that stood upon the side-table, and that fell upon some Venice glasses, and did him a crown’s worth of hurt.

1665-09-13 11:40 Sir W. Hickes’s is a good seat, with a fair grove of trees by it, and the remains of a good garden; but so let to run to ruine, both house and every thing in and about it, so ill furnished and miserably looked after, I never did see in all my life.

1665-09-13 07:20 I walked to Greenwich, taking pleasure to walk with my minute watch in my hand, by which I am come now to see the distances of my way from Woolwich to Greenwich, and do find myself to come within two minutes constantly to the same place at the end of each quarter of an hour.

1665-09-12 19:33 My wife shews me a letter from her brother speaking of their father’s being ill, like to die, which, God forgive me! did not trouble me so much as it should, though I was indeed sorry for it.

1665-09-11 22:10 I by water to Woolwich, where with my wife to a game at tables, and to bed.

1665-09-11 14:58 We were very merry, and a good plain venison dinner. After dinner to billiards, where I won an angel.

1665-09-11 10:44 We took boat and over to the ferry, where Sir W. Batten’s coach was ready for us, and to Walthamstow drove merrily, excellent merry discourse in the way, and most upon our last night’s revells.

1665-09-10 22:32 In this humour we sat till about ten at night, and so my Lord and his mistress home, and we to bed, it being one of the times of my life wherein I was the fullest of true sense of joy.

1665-09-10 21:04 This news did put us all into such an extasy of joy, that it inspired into Sir J. Minnes and Mr. Evelyn such a spirit of mirth, that in all my life I never met with so merry a two hours as our company this night was.

1665-09-10 18:55 The most happy news of my Lord Sandwich’s meeting with part of the Dutch; his taking two of their East India ships, and six or seven others, and very good prizes and that he is in search of the rest of the fleet, which he hopes to find upon the Wellbancke.

1665-09-10 17:58 My wife telling me the ill news that she hears that her father is very ill, and then I told her I feared of the plague, for that the house is shut up.

1665-09-10 16:47 I walked to Woolwich, and there find Mr. Hill, and he and I all the morning at musique and a song he hath set of three parts, very good. Anon comes Mr. Andrews, and so after dinner we to musique and sang till about 4 or 5 o’clock.

1665-09-10 08:05 Walked home; being forced thereto by one of my watermen falling sick yesterday, and it was God’s great mercy I did not go by water with them yesterday, for it is to be feared he fell sick of the plague.

1665-09-10 05:15 Though I lay the softest I ever did in my life, with a down bed, after the Danish manner, upon me, yet I slept very ill.

1665-09-09 21:44 Captain Cocke reports as a certain truth, that all the Dutch fleet, men-of-war and merchant East India ships, are got every one in from Bergen the 3rd of this month; which will make us all ridiculous.

1665-09-09 20:52 Rained all the afternoon and evening, so as my letters being done, I was forced to get a bed at Captain Cocke’s, where I find Sir W. Doyly, and he, and Evelyn at supper.

1665-09-09 14:42 I, forced to go to the office on foot through all the rain, was almost wet to my skin, and spoiled my silk breeches almost.

1665-09-09 14:20 After dinner, my Lord Bruncker and his mistress would see my wife home again, it being a most cursed rainy afternoon, having had none a great while before.

1665-09-09 13:32 By invitation, to my Lord Bruncker’s, all of us, to dinner, where a good venison pasty, and mighty merry. Here was Sir W. Doyly, lately come from Ipswich about the sick and wounded, and Mr. Evelyn and Captain Cocke.

1665-09-08 21:20 I was in great trouble all this day for my boy Tom who went to Greenwich yesterday by my order and come not home till to-night for fear of the plague, but he did come home to-night.

1665-09-07 20:46 We took leave, being exceedingly well treated here, and a most pleasant journey we had back, Povy and I, and his company most excellent in anything but business.

1665-09-07 15:32 After dinner Sir Robert led us up to his long gallery, very fine, above stairs (and better, or such, furniture I never did see), and there Mrs. Worship did give us three or four very good songs, and sings very neatly, to my great delight.

1665-09-07 11:12 Sir R. Viner showed me a boy that he had, that died of a consumption, and being dead, he caused him to be dried in an oven, and lies there entire in a box.

1665-09-07 10:26 Mr. Povy and I to Swakely, Sir R. Viner’s. He took us up and down with great respect, and showed us all his house and grounds; and it is a place not very moderne in the garden nor house, but the most uniforme in all that ever I saw; and some things to excess.

1665-09-07 05:40 I sent for the Weekely Bill, and find 8,252 dead in all, and of them 6,878 of the plague; which is a most dreadfull number, and shows reason to fear that the plague hath got that hold that it will yet continue among us.

1665-09-06 16:22 By water to the Duke of Albemarle. All the way fires on each side of the Thames, and strange to see in broad daylight two or three burials upon the Bankeside: doubtless all of the plague; and yet at least forty or fifty people going along with every one of them.

1665-09-06 13:10 To London, to pack up more things thence; and there I looked into the street and saw fires burning in the street, as it is through the whole City, by the Lord Mayor’s order.

1665-09-05 15:32 For curiosity I went into Colonell Blunt’s chariot to try it, and up the hill to the heath, and over the cart-rutts and found it pretty well, but not so easy as he pretends.

1665-09-05 14:48 After dinner comes Colonell Blunt in his new chariot made with springs; as that was of wicker, wherein a while since we rode at his house. It out-drives any coach, and out-goes any horse, and so easy, he says.

1665-09-04 17:32 It troubled me to pass by Coome farme where about twenty-one people have died of the plague, and a watch is constantly kept there night and day to keep the people in, the plague making us cruel, as dogs, one to another.

1665-09-04 11:42 Writing letters all the morning, among others to my Lady Carteret, the first I have wrote to her, telling her the state of the city as to health and other sorrowful stories.

1665-09-03 20:30 With my Lord Bruncker to Captain Cocke’s, where we mighty merry and supped, and very late I by water to Woolwich, in great apprehensions of an ague.

1665-09-03 18:44 Lord! to consider the madness of the people of the town, who will (because they are forbid) come in crowds along with the dead corps to see them buried; but we agreed on some orders for the prevention thereof.

1665-09-03 18:32 My Lord Bruncker, Sir J. Minnes, and I up to the Vestry at the desire of the justices of the Peace, Sir Theo. Biddulph and Sir W. Boreman and Alderman Hooker, in order to the doing something for the keeping of the plague from growing.

1665-09-03 16:42 I by water to Greenwich, where much ado to be suffered to come into the town because of the sickness, for fear I should come from London, till I told them who I was.

1665-09-03 14:21 I took my Lady Pen home, and her daughter Pegg, and merry we were; and after dinner I made my wife show them her pictures, which did mad Pegg Pen, who learns of the same man and cannot do so well.

1665-09-03 06:18 It is a wonder what will be the fashion after the plague is done, as to periwigs, for nobody will dare to buy any haire, for fear of the infection, that it had been cut off of the heads of people dead of the plague.

1665-09-03 06:10 Up; and put on my coloured silk suit very fine, and my new periwigg, bought a good while since, but durst not wear, because the plague was in Westminster when I bought it.

1665-09-02 16:29 I to Deptford, and there took occasion to andar a la casa de la gunaica de mi Minusier and did what I had a mind a hazer con, and volvió.

1665-09-02 13:56 To dine with Sir J. Minnes, where merry, but only that Sir J. Minnes who hath lately lost two coach horses, dead in the stable, has a third now a dying.

1665-09-01 17:36 I to London, to my house, there put many more things in order for my totall remove, sending away my girle Susan and other goods down to Woolwich.

1665-09-01 08:18 Up, and to visit my Lady Pen and her daughter at the Ropeyard where I did breakfast with them and sat chatting a good while.
