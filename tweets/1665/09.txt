1665-09-15 21:04 I in much pain to think what I shall do this winter time; for go every day to Woolwich I cannot, without endangering my life; and staying from my wife at Greenwich is not handsome.

1665-09-15 18:04 With Captain Cocke, and there drank a cup of good drink, which I am fain to allow myself during this plague time, by advice of all, and not contrary to my oath, my physician being dead, and chyrurgeon out of the way, whose advice I am obliged to take.

1665-09-15 16:56 To see how Sir W. Warren do, who is sick, and for which I have reason to be very sorry, he being the friend I have got most by of most friends in England but the King: who returns me that he is pretty well again, his disease being an ague.

1665-09-15 12:50 I got the messenger, Marlow, to get me a piece of bread and butter and cheese and a bottle of beer and ale, and so I went not out of the office but dined off that.

1665-09-14 21:17 To hear that Mr. Lewes hath another daughter sick. And, lastly, that both my servants, W. Hewer and Tom Edwards, have lost their fathers, both in St. Sepulchre’s parish, of the plague this week, do put me into great apprehensions of melancholy.

1665-09-14 21:15 To hear that poor Payne, my waiter, hath buried a child, and is dying himself. To hear that a labourer I sent but the other day to Dagenhams, to know how they did there, is dead of the plague.

1665-09-14 21:13 My finding the Angell tavern, at the lower end of Tower-hill, shut up, and more than that, the alehouse at the Tower-stairs, and more than that, the person was then dying of the plague when I was last there.

1665-09-14 21:11 On the other side, my meeting dead corpses of the plague, carried to be buried close to me at noon-day through the City in Fanchurch-street. To see a person sick of the sores, carried close by me by Gracechurch in a hackney-coach.

1665-09-14 21:09 For the first; the finding of my money and plate, and all safe at London, and speeding in my business of money this day.

1665-09-14 21:07 When I come home I spent some thoughts upon the occurrences of this day, giving matter for as much content on one hand and melancholy on another, as any day in all my life.

1665-09-14 11:42 I away back again to the Bear at the Bridge foot, being full of wind and out of order, and there called for a biscuit and a piece of cheese and gill of sack, being forced to walk over the Bridge, toward the ’Change, and the plague being all thereabouts.

1665-09-14 09:20 To the Duke of Albemarle, where I find a letter from my Lord Sandwich, of the fleete’s meeting with about eighteen more of the Dutch fleete, and his taking of most of them, which is so great a cause of joy in us all that my Lord and everybody is highly joyed thereat.

1665-09-14 07:03 Letters are just now brought from the fleete of our taking a great many more of the Dutch fleete, in which I did never more plainly see my command of my temper in my not admitting myself to receive any kind of joy from it till I had heard the certainty of it.

1665-09-13 21:21 Mr. Pen and I fell to discourse about some words in a French song my wife was saying, “D’un air tout interdict,” wherein I laid twenty to one against him which he would not agree with me, though I know myself in the right as to the sense of the word.

1665-09-13 14:50 Sir W. Hickes did give us the meanest dinner (of beef, shoulder and umbles of venison which he takes away from the keeper of the Forest, and a few pigeons, and all in the meanest manner) that ever I did see, to the basest degree.

1665-09-13 12:30 Not so much as a latch to his dining-room door; which saved him nothing, for the wind blowing into the room for want thereof, flung down a great bow pott that stood upon the side-table, and that fell upon some Venice glasses, and did him a crown’s worth of hurt.

1665-09-13 11:40 Sir W. Hickes’s is a good seat, with a fair grove of trees by it, and the remains of a good garden; but so let to run to ruine, both house and every thing in and about it, so ill furnished and miserably looked after, I never did see in all my life.

1665-09-13 07:20 I walked to Greenwich, taking pleasure to walk with my minute watch in my hand, by which I am come now to see the distances of my way from Woolwich to Greenwich, and do find myself to come within two minutes constantly to the same place at the end of each quarter of an hour.

1665-09-12 19:33 My wife shews me a letter from her brother speaking of their father’s being ill, like to die, which, God forgive me! did not trouble me so much as it should, though I was indeed sorry for it.

1665-09-11 22:10 I by water to Woolwich, where with my wife to a game at tables, and to bed.

1665-09-11 14:58 We were very merry, and a good plain venison dinner. After dinner to billiards, where I won an angel.

1665-09-11 10:44 We took boat and over to the ferry, where Sir W. Batten’s coach was ready for us, and to Walthamstow drove merrily, excellent merry discourse in the way, and most upon our last night’s revells.

1665-09-10 22:32 In this humour we sat till about ten at night, and so my Lord and his mistress home, and we to bed, it being one of the times of my life wherein I was the fullest of true sense of joy.

1665-09-10 21:04 This news did put us all into such an extasy of joy, that it inspired into Sir J. Minnes and Mr. Evelyn such a spirit of mirth, that in all my life I never met with so merry a two hours as our company this night was.

1665-09-10 18:55 The most happy news of my Lord Sandwich’s meeting with part of the Dutch; his taking two of their East India ships, and six or seven others, and very good prizes and that he is in search of the rest of the fleet, which he hopes to find upon the Wellbancke.

1665-09-10 17:58 My wife telling me the ill news that she hears that her father is very ill, and then I told her I feared of the plague, for that the house is shut up.

1665-09-10 16:47 I walked to Woolwich, and there find Mr. Hill, and he and I all the morning at musique and a song he hath set of three parts, very good. Anon comes Mr. Andrews, and so after dinner we to musique and sang till about 4 or 5 o’clock.

1665-09-10 08:05 Walked home; being forced thereto by one of my watermen falling sick yesterday, and it was God’s great mercy I did not go by water with them yesterday, for it is to be feared he fell sick of the plague.

1665-09-10 05:15 Though I lay the softest I ever did in my life, with a down bed, after the Danish manner, upon me, yet I slept very ill.

1665-09-09 21:44 Captain Cocke reports as a certain truth, that all the Dutch fleet, men-of-war and merchant East India ships, are got every one in from Bergen the 3rd of this monthx; which will make us all ridiculous.

1665-09-09 20:52 Rained all the afternoon and evening, so as my letters being done, I was forced to get a bed at Captain Cocke’s, where I find Sir W. Doyly, and he, and Evelyn at supper.

1665-09-09 14:42 I, forced to go to the office on foot through all the rain, was almost wet to my skin, and spoiled my silk breeches almost.

1665-09-09 14:20 After dinner, my Lord Bruncker and his mistress would see my wife home again, it being a most cursed rainy afternoon, having had none a great while before.

1665-09-09 13:32 By invitation, to my Lord Bruncker’s, all of us, to dinner, where a good venison pasty, and mighty merry. Here was Sir W. Doyly, lately come from Ipswich about the sick and wounded, and Mr. Evelyn and Captain Cocke.

1665-09-08 21:20 I was in great trouble all this day for my boy Tom who went to Greenwich yesterday by my order and come not home till to-night for fear of the plague, but he did come home to-night.

1665-09-07 20:46 We took leave, being exceedingly well treated here, and a most pleasant journey we had back, Povy and I, and his company most excellent in anything but business.

1665-09-07 15:32 After dinner Sir Robert led us up to his long gallery, very fine, above stairs (and better, or such, furniture I never did see), and there Mrs. Worship did give us three or four very good songs, and sings very neatly, to my great delight.

1665-09-07 11:12 Sir R. Viner showed me a boy that he had, that died of a consumption, and being dead, he caused him to be dried in an oven, and lies there entire in a box.

1665-09-07 10:26 Mr. Povy and I to Swakely, Sir R. Viner’s. He took us up and down with great respect, and showed us all his house and grounds; and it is a place not very moderne in the garden nor house, but the most uniforme in all that ever I saw; and some things to excess.

1665-09-07 05:40 I sent for the Weekely Bill, and find 8,252 dead in all, and of them 6,878 of the plague; which is a most dreadfull number, and shows reason to fear that the plague hath got that hold that it will yet continue among us.

1665-09-06 16:22 By water to the Duke of Albemarle. All the way fires on each side of the Thames, and strange to see in broad daylight two or three burials upon the Bankeside: doubtless all of the plague; and yet at least forty or fifty people going along with every one of them.

1665-09-06 13:10 To London, to pack up more things thence; and there I looked into the street and saw fires burning in the street, as it is through the whole City, by the Lord Mayor’s order.

1665-09-05 15:32 For curiosity I went into Colonell Blunt’s chariot to try it, and up the hill to the heath, and over the cart-rutts and found it pretty well, but not so easy as he pretends.

1665-09-05 14:48 After dinner comes Colonell Blunt in his new chariot made with springs; as that was of wicker, wherein a while since we rode at his house. It out-drives any coach, and out-goes any horse, and so easy, he says.

1665-09-04 17:32 It troubled me to pass by Coome farme where about twenty-one people have died of the plague, and a watch is constantly kept there night and day to keep the people in, the plague making us cruel, as dogs, one to another.

1665-09-04 11:42 Writing letters all the morning, among others to my Lady Carteret, the first I have wrote to her, telling her the state of the city as to health and other sorrowful stories.

1665-09-03 20:30 With my Lord Bruncker to Captain Cocke’s, where we mighty merry and supped, and very late I by water to Woolwich, in great apprehensions of an ague.

1665-09-03 18:44 Lord! to consider the madness of the people of the town, who will (because they are forbid) come in crowds along with the dead corps to see them buried; but we agreed on some orders for the prevention thereof.

1665-09-03 18:32 My Lord Bruncker, Sir J. Minnes, and I up to the Vestry at the desire of the justices of the Peace, Sir Theo. Biddulph and Sir W. Boreman and Alderman Hooker, in order to the doing something for the keeping of the plague from growing.

1665-09-03 16:42 I by water to Greenwich, where much ado to be suffered to come into the town because of the sickness, for fear I should come from London, till I told them who I was.

1665-09-03 14:21 I took my Lady Pen home, and her daughter Pegg, and merry we were; and after dinner I made my wife show them her pictures, which did mad Pegg Pen, who learns of the same man and cannot do so well.

1665-09-03 06:18 It is a wonder what will be the fashion after the plague is done, as to periwigs, for nobody will dare to buy any haire, for fear of the infection, that it had been cut off of the heads of people dead of the plague.

1665-09-03 06:10 Up; and put on my coloured silk suit very fine, and my new periwigg, bought a good while since, but durst not wear, because the plague was in Westminster when I bought it.

1665-09-02 16:29 I to Deptford, and there took occasion to andar a la casa de la gunaica de mi Minusier and did what I had a mind a hazer con, and volvió.

1665-09-02 13:56 To dine with Sir J. Minnes, where merry, but only that Sir J. Minnes who hath lately lost two coach horses, dead in the stable, has a third now a dying.

1665-09-01 17:36 I to London, to my house, there put many more things in order for my totall remove, sending away my girle Susan and other goods down to Woolwich.

1665-09-01 08:18 Up, and to visit my Lady Pen and her daughter at the Ropeyard where I did breakfast with them and sat chatting a good while.
