1665-05-31 22:56 I home busy, and busy late, at the end of the month, about my month’s accounts, but by the addition of Tangier it is rendered more intricate.

1665-05-30 19:42 Here I met with one that tells me that Jack Cole, my old schoolefellow, is dead and buried lately of a consumption, who was a great crony of mine.

1665-05-30 19:05 By coach, with my wife and mother and Mercer, our usual tour by coach, and eat at the old house at Islington; but, Lord! to see how my mother found herself talk upon every object to think of old stories.

1665-05-29 16:41 With my wife, mother, and Mercer in one boat, and I in another, down to Woolwich. I walking from Greenwich, the others going to and fro upon the water till my coming back, having done but little business.

1665-05-28 19:22 To see my Lady Pen, where my wife and I were shown a fine rarity: of fishes kept in a glass of water, that will live so for ever; and finely marked they are, being foreign.

1665-05-28 15:48 My poor Lady Sandwich, who is afeard of the sickness, and resolved to be gone into the country, is forced to stay in towne a day or two, or three.

1665-05-28 13:33 To Sir Philip Warwicke’s to dinner; and here I saw one pretty piece of household stuff, as the company increaseth, to put a larger leaf upon an oval table.

1665-05-28 07:10 By water to the Duke of Albemarle, where I hear that Nixon is condemned to be shot to death, for his cowardice, by a Council of War.

1665-05-27 22:50 And so to bed, with my mind full of fears for the business of this office and troubled with that of Tangier, concerning which Mr. Povy was with me, but do give me little help, but more reason of being troubled.

1665-05-26 19:37 By water to the Duke of Albemarle, whom I found mightily off the hooks, that the ships are not gone out of the River; which vexed me to see.

1665-05-25 17:28 Dined at home, and then to the office all the afternoon.

1665-05-24 10:10 To the Coffee-house, where all the news is of the Dutch being gone out, and of the plague growing upon us in this town; and of remedies against it: some saying one thing, some another.

1665-05-23 20:25 By letters from Amsterdam, the Dutch fleet, being about 100 men-of-war, besides fire-ships, &c, did set out. Being divided into seven squadrons; viz, 1. Generall Opdam. 2. Cottenar. 3. Trump. 4. Schram. 5. Stillingworth. 6. Everson. 7. One other, not named, of Zealand.

1665-05-22 22:15 Home to bed, being much troubled in mind for several things.

1665-05-22 07:03 Down to the ships, which now are hindered from going down to the fleet (to our great sorrow and shame) with their provisions, the wind being against them.

1665-05-21 09:34 This day is brought home one of my new silk suits, the plain one, but very rich camlott and noble. I tried it and it pleases me.

1665-05-20 11:55 Up, and to my office, where busy all the morning.

1665-05-19 21:20 Not being fit for business I took my wife and Mercer down by water to Greenwich, it being very fine and cool and moonshine. Mighty pleasant passage it was; there eat a cake or two.

1665-05-19 15:43 Sir W. Warren did give me several good hints and principles not to do anything suddenly, but consult my pillow upon that and every great thing of my life, before I resolve anything in it.

1665-05-19 11:40 To the Exchequer, and there got my tallies for 17,500l, the first payment I ever had out of the Exchequer, and away home with my tallies in a coach, fearful every step of having one of them fall out, or snatched from me.

1665-05-18 17:32 Abroad to speak with Sir G. Carteret; but, Lord! to see how frail a man I am, subject to my vanities, that can hardly forbear, though pressed with never so much business, my pursuing of pleasure, but home I got.

1665-05-17 16:08 Sir J. Minnes and I had an angry bout with Commissioner Pett about his neglecting his duty and absenting himself, unknown to us, from his place at Chatham, but a most false man I every day find him more and more, and in this very full of equivocation.

1665-05-17 10:10 I find my wife and Mercer, having with Langford agreed upon two rich silk suits for me, which is fit for me to have, but yet the money is too much, I doubt, to lay out altogether.

1665-05-17 00:15 Home to supper and to bed, weary.

1665-05-15 20:32 I called at the Harp and Ball, where the maid, Mary, is very ‘formosa’; but, Lord! to see in what readiness I am, upon the expiring of my vowes this day, to begin to run into all my pleasures and neglect of business.

1665-05-15 18:10 The Duke of Albemarle showed me letters from Sir G. Downing that the Dutch are come out and joyned, well-manned, and resolved to board our best ships, and fight for certain they will.

1665-05-15 17:04 To the King’s playhouse, all alone, and saw “Love’s Maistresse.” Some pretty things and good variety in it, but no or little fancy in it.

1665-05-15 02:30 Upon a letter from the Duke of Albemarle, I took boat, and down the River in a galley, my boy and I, down to the Hope and so up again, sleeping and waking, with great pleasure.

1665-05-14 17:37 I all the afternoon in the coach reading the treasonous book of the Court of King James, printed a great while ago, and worth reading, though ill intended.

1665-05-14 14:30 I to Wanstead, the house where Sir H. Mildmay died, and now Sir Robert Brookes lives, having bought it of the Duke of Yorke, it being forfeited to him. A fine seat, but an old-fashioned house; and being not full of people looks desolately.

1665-05-13 22:10 All day in some little gruntings of pain, as I used to have from winde, arising I think from my fasting so long, and want of exercise, and I think going so hot in clothes, the weather being hot, and the same clothes I wore all winter.

1665-05-13 16:24 I am apt to think with myself, how could I be so long without a watch; though I remember since, I had one, and found it a trouble, and resolved to carry one no more about me while I lived.

1665-05-13 16:22 But, Lord! to see how much of my old folly and childishnesse hangs upon me still that I cannot forbear carrying my watch in my hand in the coach all this afternoon, and seeing what o’clock it is one hundred times.

1665-05-12 10:55 To the ’Change and thence to my watchmaker, where he has put it in order, and a good and brave piece it is, and he tells me worth 14l. which is a greater present than I valued it.

1665-05-12 10:07 I find it so necessary to have some handsome clothes that I cannot but lay out some money thereupon.

1665-05-12 08:10 To the Exchequer, and there up and down through all the offices to strike my tallys for 17,500l, which methinks is so great a testimony of the goodness of God to me, that I, from a mean clerk there, should come to strike tallys myself for that sum.

1665-05-11 11:55 Up betimes, and at the office all the morning.

1665-05-10 19:48 By appointment to Sir W. Warren and Mr. Deering at a tavern hard by with intent to do some good upon their agreement in a great bargain of planks.

1665-05-10 13:20 My business, which I am sorry for, keeps me from paying the respect I ought to my mother at her first coming, she being grown very weak in her judgement, and doating again in her discourse, through age and some trouble in her family.

1665-05-10 12:44 Home to dinner, and there find my poor mother come out of the country today in good health, and I am glad to see her.

1665-05-10 07:33 The Duke did give Sir W. Batten and me an account of the late taking of eight ships, and of his intent to come back to the Gunfleete with the fleet presently.

1665-05-09 18:30 We have news of eight ships being taken by some of ours going into the Texel, their two men of war, that convoyed them, running in. They come from about Ireland, round to the north.

1665-05-09 13:57 Mrs. The. Turner dines with us, and my wife’s painting-master staid and dined; and I take great pleasure in thinking that my wife will really come to something in that business.

1665-05-08 07:48 Captain Taylor would leave the management of most of his business now he is going to Harwich, upon me, and if I can get money by it, which I believe it will, I shall take some of it upon me.

1665-05-07 20:44 Comes Mr. Hill and a gentleman, a friend of his, one Mr. Scott, that sings well also, and then comes Mr. Andrews, and we all sung and supped, and then to sing again and passed the Sunday very pleasantly and soberly.

1665-05-07 11:05 Yesterday begun my wife to learn to limn of one Browne, which Mr. Hill helps her to, and, by her beginning upon some eyes, I think she will do very fine things, and I shall take great delight in it.

1665-05-07 00:12 So home to bed, pleased as I always am after I have rid a great deal of work, it being very satisfactory to me.

1665-05-05 20:30 After I had suffered my own hayre to grow long, in order to wearing it, I find the convenience of periwiggs is so great, that I have cut off all short again, and will keep to periwiggs.

1665-05-05 18:14 My wife tells me that she hears that my poor aunt James hath had her breast cut off here in town, her breast having long been out of order.

1665-05-05 15:04 To Mr. Evelyn’s; he being abroad, we walked in his garden, and a lovely noble ground he hath indeed. And among other rarities, a hive of bees, so as being hived in glass, you may see the bees making their honey and combs mighty pleasantly.

1665-05-05 12:20 Down to Woolwich and back to Blackewall, and there, viewed the Breach, in order to a Mast Docke, and so to Deptford to the Globe.

1665-05-04 23:55 To the office again all day till almost midnight, and then, weary, home to supper and to bed.

1665-05-03 15:55 To Gresham College, and saw a cat killed with the Duke of Florence’s poison, and saw it proved that the oyle of tobacco drawn by one of the Society do the same effect.

1665-05-03 11:40 To the Inn again by Cripplegate, expecting my mother’s coming to town, but she is not come this week neither, the coach being too full.

1665-05-02 15:04 Sir W. Batten and my Lady and my wife and I by appointment yesterday to the Rhenish winehouse at the Steelyard, and there eat a couple of lobsters and some prawns, and pretty merry.

1665-05-01 21:15 Back by coach to Greenwich, and in his pleasure boat to Deptford, and there stopped and in to Mr. Evelyn’s, which is a most beautiful place; but it being dark and late, I staid not.

1665-05-01 15:30 Several we tried; but one experiment did prove mighty easy (not here for me to describe, but the whole body of the coach lies upon one long spring), and we all, one after another, rid in it; and it is very fine and likely to take.

1665-05-01 15:10 No extraordinary dinner, nor any other entertainment good; but only after dinner to the tryall of some experiments about making of coaches easy.

1665-05-01 13:45 Landed at the Tower-wharf, and thence by water to Greenwich; and there coaches met us; and to Colonell Blunt’s house, a very stately sight for situation and brave plantations; and among others, a vineyard, the first that ever I did see.

1665-05-01 12:04 Going to the ’Change I met my Lord Brunkard, Sir Robert Murry, Deane Wilkins, and Mr. Hooke, going by coach to Colonell Blunts to dinner. So they stopped and took me with them.
