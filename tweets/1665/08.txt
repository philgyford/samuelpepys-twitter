1665-08-31 22:07   After a good merry dinner I to my office, and there late writing letters, and then to Woolwich by water, where pleasant with my wife and people, and after supper to bed.

1665-08-31 11:33   In the City died this week 7,496 and of them 6,102 of the plague. But it is feared that the true number of the dead, this week is near 10,000.

1665-08-30 21:12   Of this at this day above 1800l. in cash in my house, which speaks but little out of my hands in desperate condition, but this is very troublesome to have in my house at this time.

1665-08-30 21:10   To my great joy do find myself yet in the much best condition that ever I was in, finding myself worth 2180l. and odd, besides plate and goods, which I value at 250l. more, which is a very great blessing to me.

1665-08-30 09:22   Lord! how every body’s looks, and discourse in the street is of death, and nothing else, and few people going up and down, that the town is like a place distressed and forsaken.

1665-08-29 09:20   I called at Sir Theophilus Biddulph’s, a sober, discreet man, to discourse of the preventing of the plague in Greenwich, and Woolwich, and Deptford, where in every place it begins to grow very great.

1665-08-29 05:46   My wife begun to tell me the difference between her and Mercer, and that it was only from restraining her to gad abroad to some Frenchmen that were in the town, which I do not wholly yet in part believe.

1665-08-28 20:21   The fleet is gone out again, for which God be praised! and my Lord Sandwich hath done himself great right in it, in getting so soon out again. I pray God, he may meet the enemy.

1665-08-28 17:37   W. Hewer shows me a letter which Mercer had wrote to her mother about a great difference between my wife and her yesterday, and that my wife will have her go away presently. This did trouble me exceedingly.

1665-08-28 15:56   I sent down my boy to Woolwich with some things before me, in order to my lying there for good and all, and so I followed him.

1665-08-28 10:40   I to the Exchange, and I think there was not fifty people upon it. Thus I think to take adieu to-day of the London streets.

1665-08-27 17:48   All the afternoon at my office till late making up my papers and letters there into a good condition of order.

1665-08-26 22:15   I by water home, in my way seeing a man taken up dead, out of the hold of a small catch that lay at Deptford. I doubt it might be the plague, which did something disturb me. Home sooner than ordinary, and after supper, to read melancholy alone, and then to bed.

1665-08-26 11:13   I down by water to Greenwich, where we met the first day my Lord Bruncker, Sir J. Minnes, and I, and I think we shall do well there, and begin very auspiciously to me by having my account passed, and put into a way of having it presently paid.

1665-08-25 19:20   I am told that Dr. Burnett, my physician, is this morning dead of the plague; which is strange, his man dying so long ago, and his house this month open again. Now himself dead.

1665-08-24 15:10   Down to Sir J. Minnes and Lord Bruncker to Greenwich to sign some of the Treasurer’s books, and there dined very well; and thence to look upon our rooms again at the King’s house, which are not yet ready for us.

1665-08-23 17:48   Received a very kind and good letter from my Lord Sandwich of his arrival with the fleet at Solebay, and the joy he has at my last news he met with, of the marriage of my Lady Jemimah.

1665-08-23 11:27   And jo haze ella mettre su mano upon my pragma hasta hazerme hazer la cosa in su mano. Pero ella no voulut permettre que je ponebam meam manum a ella, but I do not doubt but ἀλλῳ χρόνῳ de obtenir le.

1665-08-23 10:45   Comes by a pretence of mine yesterday old Delks the waterman, with his daughter Robins, and several times to and again, he leaving her with me, about the getting of his son Robins off, who was pressed yesterday again.

1665-08-22 15:22   I to the King’s yard, walked up and down, and by and by out at the back gate, and there saw the Bagwells wifes, mother and daughter, and went to them, and went in to the daughter’s house with the mother and faciebam la cosa que ego tenebam a mind to con ella.

1665-08-22 07:04   Being importuned by my wife and her two maids, which are both good wenches, for me to buy a necklace of pearl for her, and I promising to give her one of 60l. in two years at furthest, and in less if she pleases me in her painting.

1665-08-21 23:52   I to my wife, and having first viewed her last piece of drawing since I saw her, which is seven or eight days, which pleases me beyond any thing in the world, to bed with great content but weary.

1665-08-21 22:04   Messengers went to get a boat for me, to carry me to Woolwich, but all to no purpose; so I was forced to walk it in the dark, being mightily troubled for fear of the doggs at Coome farme, and more for fear of rogues by the way, and yet more because of the plague which is there.

1665-08-21 18:54   To my Lord Bruncker, at Greenwich, to look after the lodgings appointed for us there for our office, which do by no means please me, they being in the heart of all the labourers and workmen there, which makes it as unsafe as to be.

1665-08-21 15:40   To Sir W. Warren’s and with him two hours, talking of things to his and my profit, and particularly good advice from him what use to make of Sir G. Carteret’s kindness to me and my interest in him.

1665-08-21 12:27   I to Sir W. Batten’s house to dinner, whither comes Captain Cocke, for whose epicurisme a dish of partriges was sent for, and still gives me reason to think is the greatest epicure in the world.

1665-08-20 21:27   To Queenhive, very dark. Thence with a lanthorn, in great fear of meeting of dead corpses, carried to be buried.

1665-08-20 16:04   I ’light and paid off my post-horses, and so slipped on my shoes, and laid my things by, the tide not serving, and to church, where a dull sermon, and many Londoners.

1665-08-20 11:29   I did presently eat a bit off the spit, and so took horse for Staines, and thence to Brainford to Mr. Povy’s, the weather being very pleasant to ride in.

1665-08-20 06:04   Sir G. Carteret come and walked by my bedside half an houre, talking and telling me how my Lord is in this unblameable in all this ill-success, he having followed orders; and that all ought to be imputed to the falseness of the King of Denmarke.

1665-08-19 23:58   So to sleep; being very well, but weary, and the better by having carried with me a bottle of strong water; whereof now and then a sip did me good.

1665-08-19 22:59   In the dark I perceive an old house new building with a great deal of rubbish, and was fain to go up a ladder to Sir G. Carteret’s chamber. And there in his bed I sat down, and told him all my bad news, which troubled him mightily.

1665-08-19 22:08   To Stanes, and there by this time it was dark night, and got a guide who lost his way in the forest, till by help of the moone (which recompenses me for all the pains I ever took about studying of her motions) I led my guide into the way back again.

1665-08-19 18:32   I by water to Charing-Cross, to the post-house, and there the people tell me they are shut up; and so I went to the new post-house, and there got a guide and horses to Hounslow.

1665-08-19 13:07   Our fleet is come home to our great grief with not above five weeks’ dry, and six days’ wet provisions: however, must out again; and the Duke hath ordered the Soveraigne, and all other ships ready, to go out to the fleet to strengthen them.

1665-08-19 13:05   My Lord having commanded Teddiman with twenty-two ships to go to Bergen, Teddiman began to play at the Dutch ships, and in three hours’ time they did cut all our cables, so as the wind being off the land, did force us to go out, we having lost five commanders.

1665-08-19 03:04   I late in the dark to Gravesend, where great is the plague, and I troubled to stay there so long for the tide. At 10 at night, having supped, I took boat alone, and slept well all the way to the Tower dock.

1665-08-18 15:10   Arguing with the Commissioner about his proposing the laying out so much money upon Sheerenesse, unless it be to the slighting of Chatham yard, for it is much a better place than Chatham.

1665-08-18 14:20   To the Hill house at Chatham and there dined, and after dinner spent some time discoursing of business.

1665-08-18 08:37   To Sheernesse, where we walked up and down, laying out the ground to be taken in for a yard to lay provisions for cleaning and repairing of ships, and a most proper place it is for the purpose.

1665-08-18 06:15   Up and dressed ourselves, and to sail again down to the Soveraigne at the buoy of the Nore, a noble ship, now rigged and fitted and manned.

1665-08-18 03:40   As we grew sleepy, went in and upon velvet cushions of the King’s that belong to the yacht fell to sleep, which we all did pretty well, having risen in the night to look for a new comet which is said to have lately shone, but we could see no such thing.

1665-08-17 22:09   Short of Gravesend we come to an anchor, and to supper mighty merry, and after it, being moonshine, we out of the cabbin to laugh and talk.

1665-08-17 16:28   We down to the water and by boat to Greenwich to the Bezan yacht, where Sir W. Batten, Sir J. Minnes, my Lord Bruncker and myself, with some servants, embarked in the yacht.

1665-08-16 16:40   I had the ill news from Dagenhams, that my poor lord of Hinchingbroke his indisposition is turned to the small-pox. Poor gentleman! that he should be come from France so soon to fall sick.

1665-08-16 13:37   Mighty merry with Captain Cocke and Fenn at Sir G. Smith’s, and a brave dinner, but I think Cocke is the greatest epicure that is, eats and drinks with the greatest pleasure and liberty that ever man did.

1665-08-16 10:30   Contrary news to-day upon the ’Change, some that our fleet hath taken some of the Dutch East India ships, others that we did attaque it and were repulsed, others that our fleet is in great danger by meeting with almost 100 sail of men of war.

1665-08-16 09:13   To the Exchange, where I have not been a great while. But, Lord! how sad a sight it is to see the streets empty of people, and very few upon the ’Change. About us two shops in three, if not more, generally shut up.

1665-08-15 21:58   I land at Church-yard stairs, where, to my great trouble, I met a dead corps of the plague, in the narrow ally just bringing down a little pair of stairs. But I thank God I was not much disturbed at it.

1665-08-15 05:15   Something put last night’s dream into my head, which I think is the best that ever was dreamt, which was that I had my Lady Castlemayne in my armes and was admitted to use all the dalliance I desired with her.

1665-08-14 20:52   I did present my wife with the dyamond ring, awhile since given me by Dicke Vines’s brother, for helping him to be a purser, valued at about 10l, the first thing of that nature I did ever give her.

1665-08-14 17:48   To Sir W. Batten’s, where very merry, good cheer, and up and down the garden with great content to me, and, after dinner, beat Captain Cocke at billiards, won about 8s. of him and my Lord Bruncker.

1665-08-13 22:04   To bed with a mind as free as to the business of the world as if I were not worth 100l. in the whole world, every thing being evened under my hand in my books and papers.

1665-08-13 17:10   Clearing all matters in packing up my papers and books, and giving instructions in writing to my executors, thereby perfecting the whole business of my will, to my very great joy.

1665-08-12 19:32   I am told, too, that a wife of one of the groomes at Court is dead at Salsbury; so that the King and Queene are speedily to be all gone to Milton.

1665-08-12 19:27   My Lord Mayor commands people to be within at nine at night all, as they say, that the sick may have liberty to go abroad for ayre.

1665-08-12 19:10   The people die so, that now it seems they are fain to carry the dead to be buried by day-light, the nights not sufficing to do it in.

1665-08-12 13:58   Coming back to Deptford, old Bagwell walked a little way with me, and would have me in to his daughter’s, and there he being gone dehors, ego had my volunté de su hija.

1665-08-12 13:20   I down to Greenwich and sent away the Bezan, thinking to go with my wife to-night to come back again to-morrow night to the Soveraigne at the buoy off the Nore.

1665-08-11 21:27   So long as I keep myself in company at meals and do there eat lustily, I am as well as can be, but when I come to be alone, I do not eat in time, nor enough, nor with any good heart, and I immediately begin to be full of wind.

1665-08-11 20:36   At my papers, and putting up my books into chests, and settling my house and all things in the best and speediest order I can, lest it should please God to take me away, or force me to leave my house.

1665-08-11 11:40   I to the Exchequer, about striking new tallys, and I find the Exchequer, by proclamation, removing to Nonesuch.

1665-08-11 10:04   A pleasant rencontre happened in having a young married woman brought me by her father, to get her husband off that he should not go to sea. Uno ombre pouvait avoir done any cosa cum ella, but I did natha sino besar her.

1665-08-10 21:26   Home, to draw over anew my will, which I had bound myself by oath to dispatch by to-morrow night; the town growing so unhealthy, that a man cannot depend upon living two days to an end.

1665-08-10 11:44   An odd story of Alderman Bence’s stumbling at night over a dead corps in the street, and going home and telling his wife, she at the fright, being with child, fell sick and died of the plague.

1665-08-10 11:31   In great trouble to see the Bill this week rise so high, to above 4,000 in all, and of them above 3,000 of the plague.

1665-08-10 07:30   Called upon by my she-cozen Porter, the turner’s wife, to tell me that her husband was carried to the Tower, for buying of some of the King’s powder, and would have my help, but I could give her none.

1665-08-09 20:55   To my office, where Tom Hater to the writing of letters with me, which have for a good while been in arreare, and we close at it all day.

1665-08-08 20:12   Home through the City again, wishing I may have taken no ill in going; but I will go, I think, no more thither.

1665-08-08 19:10   To Westminster Hall, where talking, hearing very sad stories from Mrs. Mumford. Poor Will, that used to sell us ale at the Hall-door, his wife and three children died, all, I think, in a day.

1665-08-08 13:27   After dinner Bagwell’s wife waited at the door, and went with me to my office, en lequel jo haze todo which I had a corasón a hazer con ella.

1665-08-07 18:37   There comes Luellin, about Mr. Deering’s business of planke, and offers me twenty pieces in gold, as Deering had done some time since himself, but I both then and now refused it, resolving not to be bribed to dispatch business.

1665-08-07 15:57   I met Dr. Twisden, Mr. Povy, Mr. Lawson, and Stockdale about settling their business of money; but such confusion I never met with, nor could anything be agreed on, but parted like a company of fools, I vexed to lose so much time and pains to no purpose.

1665-08-07 07:42   My Lady Pen went forth and I staid there talking with Mrs. Pegg and looking over her pictures, and commended them; but, Lord! so far short of my wife’s, as no comparison.

1665-08-06 22:15   It raining hard, down to Woolwich, where after some little talk to bed.

1665-08-06 07:04   Had my head combed by my little girle, to whom I confess que je sum demasiado kind, nuper ponendo sæpe mes mains in su dos choses de son breast. Mais il faut que je leave it, lest it bring me to alguno major inconvenience.

1665-08-05 20:12   I am told of a great ryott upon Thursday last in Cheapside; Colonell Danvers, a delinquent, having been taken, and in his way to the Tower was rescued from the captain of the guard, and carried away.

1665-08-05 18:10   De Ruyter is come home, with all his fleet, which is very ill news, considering the charge we have been at in keeping a fleet to the northward so long, besides the great expectation of snapping him.

1665-08-05 13:30   My Lord Bruncker and I talked over several businesses, among others our design upon the mast docke, which I hope to compass and get 2 or 300l. by.

1665-08-05 08:22   Away by water, having ordered in the yard six or eight bargemen to be whipped, who had last night stolen some of the King’s cordage from out of the yard.

1665-08-05 06:10   My wife showed me several things of her doing, especially one fine woman’s Persian head mighty finely done, beyond what I could expect of her.

1665-08-04 22:44   I took boat and down to Woolwich very late, and there found my wife and her woman upon the key hearing a fellow in a barge that lay by fiddle.

1665-08-04 19:32   Home, and found all things well, and letters from Dover that my Lord Hinchingbroke is arrived at Dover, and would be at Scott’s hall this night, where the whole company will meet. I wish myself with them.

1665-08-04 14:04   I took horse, and Mr. Barrow with me bore me company to Gravesend, discoursing of his business, wherein I vexed him, and he me, I seeing his frowardness, but yet that he is in my conscience a very honest man.

1665-08-04 08:26   With much joy, bade “God be with you!” and an end I think it will be to my mirth for a great while, it having been the passage of my whole life the most pleasing for the time.

1665-08-04 06:46   To Mr. Pett’s, who led us into his garden, and there the lady, the best humoured woman in the world, and a devout woman, clambered up to the top of the banquetting-house to gather nuts.

1665-08-03 21:50   Come to Chatham mighty merry, and anon to supper. Sir G. Carteret did take an opportunity to speak with much value and kindness to me, which is of great joy to me.

1665-08-03 17:32   We had some difference with some watermen, who would not tow the horses over under 20s, whereupon I swore to send one of them to sea and will do it.

1665-08-03 12:43   I took leave of my Lady Sandwich, and then down to the buttery, and eat a piece of cold venison pie, and drank and took some bread and cheese in my hand; and so mounted after them.

1665-08-03 11:05   I rode very finely to Dagenhams; all the way people, citizens, walking to and again to enquire how the plague is in the City this week by the Bill; which by chance, at Greenwich, I had heard was 2,020 of the plague, and 3,000 and odd of all diseases.

1665-08-03 06:03   Up, and betimes to Deptford to Sir G. Carteret’s, where, not liking the horse that had been hired by Mr. Uthwayt for me, I did desire Sir G. Carteret to let me ride his new 40l. horse, which he did, and so I left my ‘hacquenee’ behind.

1665-08-02 17:32   Allowing myself several sums which I had hitherto not reckoned myself sure of, because I would not be over sure of any thing, though with reason I might do it, I did find myself really worth 1900l, for which the great God of Heaven and Earth be praised!

1665-08-02 17:20   It being a public fast for the plague; I within doors all day, and upon my monthly accounts.

1665-08-01 22:47   Drove hard home, and it was night ere we got to Deptford, where, with much kindness from them to me, I left them, and home to the office, where I find all well.

1665-08-01 13:58   Very merry at dinner, and so to talk and laugh after dinner, and up and down, some to one place, some to another, full of content on all sides.

1665-08-01 08:02   I first to see the bridegroom and bride, and found them both up, and he gone to dress himself. Both red in the face, and well enough pleased this morning with their night’s lodging.
