1665-11-08 20:04 I did take water, being glad I was out of the town; for the plague, it seems, rages there more than ever.

1665-11-08 19:40 By water to Deptford, and there did order my matters so, walking up and down the fields till it was dark night, that je alloy à la maison of my valentine, and there je faisais whatever je voudrais avec her.

1665-11-08 11:13 It being a fast day, all people were at church and the office quiet; so I did much business.

1665-11-07 23:50 To my lodging and there spent the evening talking with Mrs. Penington, who is a very discreet, understanding lady and very pretty discourse we had and great variety.

1665-11-06 19:26 Sir G. Carteret and I did walk an hour in the garden, talking of my Lord Sandwich’s business; what enemies he hath, and how they have endeavoured to bespatter him.

1665-11-05 17:36 In fine, a most excellent person Mr. Evelyn is, and must be allowed a little for a little conceitedness; but he may well be so, being a man so much above others.

1665-11-05 17:21 Here comes in, in the middle of our discourse Captain Cocke, as drunk as a dog, but could stand, and talk and laugh. He did so joy himself in a brave woman that he had been with all the afternoon, and who should it be but my Lady Robinson.

1665-11-05 17:05 Mr. Evelyn showed me his Hortus Hyemalis; leaves laid up in a book of several plants kept dry, which preserve colour, however, and look very finely, better than any Herball.

1665-11-05 16:39 Mr. Evelyn read me part of a play or two of his making, very good, but not as he conceits them, I think, to be.

1665-11-05 16:06 To Mr. Evelyn, who showed me most excellent painting in little; in distemper, Indian incke, water colours, graveing; and, above all, the whole secret of mezzo-tinto, and the manner of it, which is very pretty, and good things done with it.

1665-11-05 13:38 To dinner, where a great deal of silly discourse, but the worst is I hear that the plague increases much at Lambeth, St. Martin’s and Westminster, and fear it will all over the city.

1665-11-05 09:50 I heard the Duke of Albemarle’s chaplain cried: “All our physicians cannot tell what an ague is, and all our arithmetique is not able to number the days of a man;” which, God knows, is not the fault of arithmetique, but that our understandings reach not the thing.

1665-11-04 17:50 I to the office, and much troubled to have 100 seamen all the afternoon there, swearing below and cursing us, and breaking the glass windows, and swear they will pull the house down.

1665-11-04 09:22 I sent Mr. Hater and W. Hewer to speak with the mother; but they returned to me, satisfied that there is no hurt nor danger, but the boy is well, and offers to be searched.

1665-11-04 08:37 To my office, my head a little akeing, partly for want of natural rest, partly having so much business to do to-day, and partly from the news I hear that one of the little boys at my lodging is not well; and they suspect that it may be the plague.

1665-11-03 21:42 With a brave gale and tide reached up to the Hope, taking great pleasure in learning the seamen’s manner of singing when they sound the depths.

1665-11-03 19:33 To dinner, where my Lord infinitely kind to me, and after dinner I rose and left him with some Commanders at the table taking tobacco.

1665-11-03 13:10 I found my Lord on board the Royall James, and with him an hour alone discoursing what was my chief and only errand about what was advisable for his Lordship to do in this state of things, himself being under the Duke of York’s and Mr. Coventry’s envy.

1665-11-03 08:45 Was called up about four o’clock and in the dark by lanthorn took boat and to the Ketch and set sail, sleeping a little in the Cabbin till day and then up and fell to reading of Mr. Evelyn’s book about Paynting, which is a very pretty book.

1665-11-02 12:58 I home to my lodgings to dinner, and there comes Captain Wagers newly returned from the Streights, who puts me in great fear for our last ships that went to Tangier with provisions, that they will be taken.

1665-11-01 21:42 This night we called upon Coll. Cleggatt, who tells us for certain that the King of Denmark hath declared to stand for the King of England, but since I hear it is wholly false.

1665-11-01 15:50 It being my Lord Bruncker’s birth-day, had every one a green riband tied in our hats very foolishly; and methinks mighty disgracefully for my Lord to have his folly so open to all the world with this woman.

1665-11-01 13:19 It being a very foul day for rain and a hideous wind, yet having promised I would go by water to Erith, and bearing sail was in danger of oversetting, but ordered them take down their sail, and so cold and wet got thither.

1665-11-01 07:40 Lay very long in bed discoursing with Mr. Hill of most things of a man’s life, and how little merit do prevail in the world, but only favour; and that, for myself, chance without merit brought me in; and that diligence only keeps me so.

1665-11-01 00:20 I in great hopes of my place of Surveyor-Generall of the Victualling, which will bring me 300l. per annum.

1665-11-01 00:15 Want of money in the Navy puts everything out of order. Men grow mutinous; and nobody here to mind the business of the Navy but myself.

1665-11-01 00:10 After some fears that the plague would have increased again this week, I hear for certain that there is above 400 less, the whole number being 1,388, and of them of the plague, 1,031.
