1665-03-31 15:10   To my Lady Sandwich’s to dinner, and up to her chamber after dinner, and there discoursed about Sir G. Carteret’s son, in proposition between us two for my Lady Jemimah.

1665-03-31 10:30   To my office and there made up my month’s account, which, God be praised! rose to 1300l. Which I bless God for.

1665-03-30 17:13   To see Mrs. Martin, whose husband being it seems gone away, and as she is informed he hath another woman whom he uses, and has long done, as a wife, she is mighty reserved and resolved to keep herself so till the return of her husband, which a pleasant thing to think of her.

1665-03-29 18:20   Calling for my Lord Cooke’s three volumes at my bookseller’s, and so home, where I found a new cook mayd, that promises very little.

1665-03-29 09:50   Into the City, but upon Povy’s tally could not get any money in Lumbard Streete, through the disrepute which he suffers, I perceive, upon his giving up his place, which people think was not choice, but necessity, as indeed it was.

1665-03-28 12:15   Up betimes and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and I did most of the business there, God wot.

1665-03-27 13:57   To my Lord Peterborough’s. We had here the genteelest dinner and the neatest house that I have seen many a day, and the latter beyond anything I ever saw in a nobleman’s house.

1665-03-27 10:45   To Mrs. Martin, who, though her husband is gone away, as he writes, like a fool into France, yet is as simple and wanton as ever she was, with much I made myself merry and away.

1665-03-27 09:32   To the Duke of Albemarle, the first time that we officers of the Navy have waited upon him since the Duke of Yorke’s going, who hath deputed him to be Admirall in his absence.

1665-03-27 07:10   Up betimes to Mr. Povy’s, and there did sign and seal my agreement with him about my place of being Treasurer for Tangier.

1665-03-26 09:32   I am at a losse to know whether it be my hare’s foot which is my preservative against wind, for I never had a fit of the collique since I wore it, or my keeping my back cool, or whether it be my taking of a pill of turpentine every morning.

1665-03-26 09:10   This is the day seven years which, by the blessing of God, I have survived of my being cut of the stone, and am now in very perfect good health and have long been.

1665-03-25 13:24   Dined alone with Sir W. Batten, where great discourse of Sir W. Pen, Sir W. Batten being, I perceive, quite out of love with him, thinking him too great and too high.

1665-03-24 19:25   To my Lady Sandwich’s, where my wife all this day. Here we supped, and talked very merry. My Lady alone with me, very earnest about Sir G. Carteret’s son, with whom I perceive they do desire my Lady Jemimah may be matched.

1665-03-24 14:37   To our discourse with Povy, Creed, Mr. Viner, and Poyntz about the business of the Workehouse at Clerkenwell, and after dinner went thither and saw all the works there. I do not think we can safely meddle with it, but the thing is very ingenious and laudable.

1665-03-23 20:40   Great talk of noises of guns heard at Deale, but nothing particularly whether in earnest or not.

1665-03-23 08:33   My Lord received me, busy as he was, with mighty kindness and joy at my promotions; telling me most largely how the Duke hath expressed on all occasions his good opinion of my service and love for me.

1665-03-23 08:10   To my Lord Sandwich, who follows the Duke this day by water down to the Hope, where “The Prince” lies.

1665-03-22 19:22   I saw the Duke, kissed his hand, and had his most kind expressions of his value and opinion of me, which comforted me above all things in the world.

1665-03-22 15:10   To Gresham College, and there did see a kitling killed almost quite, but that we could not quite kill her, with such a way; the ayre out of a receiver, wherein she was put, and then the ayre being let in upon her revives her immediately.

1665-03-22 11:51   As among others, that could discover truly the way of milk coming into the breasts of a woman; and he that could invent proper characters to express to another the mixture of relishes and tastes.

1665-03-22 11:50   Sir William Petty did tell me that in good earnest he hath in his will left such parts of his estate to him that could invent such and such things.

1665-03-22 09:30   To Mr. Coventry, whose profession of love and esteem for me to myself was so large and free that I never could expect or wish for more, nor could have it from any man in England, that I should value it more.

1665-03-21 16:55   The coach drove through a lane by Drury Lane, where abundance of loose women stood at the doors, which, God forgive me, did put evil thoughts in me, but proceeded no further, blessed be God.

1665-03-21 15:22   To Mr. Povy’s to discourse about settling our business of Treasurer, and I think all things will go very fayre between us and to my content, but the more I see the more silly the man seems to me.

1665-03-21 07:48   Up, and my taylor coming to me, did consult all my wardrobe how to order my clothes against next summer.

1665-03-20 10:42   I received their constitution under all their hands; so that I am already confirmed their Treasurer, and put into a condition of striking of tallys; and all without one harsh word or word of dislike, but quite the contrary; which is a good fortune beyond all imagination.

1665-03-20 10:30   Secretary Bennet did deliver the Duke’s command, which was received with great content; the Secretary repeating also the Duke’s character of me. I could discern my Lord FitzHarding was well pleased with me, and whispered something seriously of me to the Secretary.

1665-03-20 10:26   Povy did declare that for the future, that the work might be better done and with more quiet to him, he desired, by approbation of the Duke, he might resign his place to Mr. Pepys.

1665-03-20 10:15   To the Committee of Tangier. Povy did declare his business very handsomely; that he was sorry he had been so unhappy in his accounts, as not to give their Lordships the satisfaction he intended, and that he was sure his accounts are right.

1665-03-19 15:26   There was also my Lady Kerneguy, once my Lady Anne Hambleton, that is said to have given the Duke a clap upon his first coming over.

1665-03-19 15:20   Mr. Povy and I in his coach to Hyde Parke, being the first day of the tour there – where many brave ladies; among others, Castlemayne lay impudently upon her back in her coach asleep, with her mouth open.

1665-03-19 11:13   I to Mr. Coventry, and there had his most friendly and ingenuous advice, advising me not to decline the thing, it being that that will bring me to be known to great persons, while now I am buried among three or four of us, says he, in the Navy.

1665-03-19 09:47   We went to Creed’s new lodging in the Mewes, and there we found Creed with his parrot upon his shoulder, which struck Mr. Povy coming by just by the eye, very deep, which, had it hit his eye, had put it out.

1665-03-19 08:04   To our great trouble do find that my Lord FitzHarding do appear for Mr. Brunkard to be Paymaster upon Povy’s going out, by a former promise of the Duke’s, and offering to give as much as any for it.

1665-03-18 21:22   Povy acquainted me before Creed what he had done in speaking to the Duke and others about his making me Treasurer, and has carried it a great way, so as I think it cannot well be set back.

1665-03-18 21:10   Povy and Creed and I to do some business upon Povy’s accounts all the afternoon till late at night, where, God help him! never man was so confounded, and all his people about him in this world as he and his are.

1665-03-17 21:18   My Lady Wood died of the small-pox, and is much lamented among the great persons for a good-natured woman and a good wife, but for all that it was ever believed she was as others are.

1665-03-17 17:20   Of his owne accord, Povy proposed to me that he would surrender his place of Treasurer to me to have half the profit. The thing is new to me; but the more I think the more I like it.

1665-03-17 15:32   To the Committee again, where a new meeting of trouble about Povy, who still makes his business worse and worse, and broke up with the most open shame to him, and high words to him of disgrace that they would not trust him with any more money till he had given an account of this.

1665-03-17 10:50   To the Committee of Tangier. The whole business was the stating of Povy’s accounts, of whom to say no more, never could man say worse himself nor have worse said of him than was by the company to his face; I mean, as to his folly and very reflecting words to his honesty.

1665-03-17 09:40   The Duke did give us some commands, and so broke up. The best piece of newes is, that instead of a great many troublesome Lords, the whole business is to be left with the Duke of Albemarle to act as Admirall in his stead; which is a thing that do cheer my heart.

1665-03-16 22:06   Come Mr. Andrews with 36l, the further fruits of my Tangier contract, and so to bed late and weary with business, but in good content of mind, blessing God for these his benefits.

1665-03-16 15:40   Mr. Harris, the sayle-maker, sent me a noble present of two large silver candlesticks and snuffers, and a slice to keep them upon, which indeed is very handsome.

1665-03-15 16:27   To Gresham College, where, among other good discourse, there was tried the great poyson of Maccassa upon a dogg,1 but it had no effect all the time we sat there.

1665-03-14 13:05   Dined with Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes, at the Tower, with Sir J. Robinson, at a farewell dinner which he gives Major Holmes at his going out of the Tower, where he hath for some time, since his coming from Guinny, been a prisoner.

1665-03-13 21:44   This day my wife begun to wear light-coloured locks, quite white almost, which, though it makes her look very pretty, yet not being natural, vexes me, that I will not have her wear them.

1665-03-13 15:10   Meeting a letter from Mrs. Martin desiring to speak with me, I (though against my promise of visiting her) did go, and there found her in her childbed dress desiring my favour to get her husband a place.

1665-03-13 05:32   Up betimes, this being the first morning of my promise upon a forfeite not to lie in bed a quarter of an hour after my first waking.

1665-03-12 15:40   I after much discourse with my Lady about Sir G. Carteret’s son, of whom she hath some thoughts for a husband for my Lady Jemimah, we away home.

1665-03-12 12:20   My Lord and I talked of getting W. Howe to be put into the Muster-Mastershipp in the roome of Creed, if Creed will give way, but my Lord do it without any great gusto, calling Howe a proud coxcomb in passion.

1665-03-12 11:32   I read over the Bishop of Chichester’s sermon upon the anniversary of the King’s death, much cried up, but, methinks, but a mean sermon.

1665-03-11 19:22   This day returned Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes from Lee Roade, where they have been to see the wrecke of “The London,” out of which, they say, the guns may be got, but the hull of her will be wholly lost, as not being capable of being weighed.

1665-03-10 15:05   To the Committee of Tangier at White Hall, where my Lord Barkely and Craven and others; but, Lord! to see how superficially things are done in the business of the Lottery, which will be the disgrace of the Fishery, and without profit.

1665-03-10 12:43   To the ‘Change, where very hot, people’s proposal of the City giving the King another ship for “The London,” that is lately blown up, which would be very handsome, and if well managed, might be done.

1665-03-09 21:58   This night my wife had a new suit of flowered ash-coloured silk, very noble.

1665-03-09 16:28   At Paule’s Schoole, where I visited Mr. Crumlum at his house; and, Lord! to see how ridiculous a conceited pedagogue he is, though a learned man, he being so dogmaticall in all he do and says.

1665-03-09 15:12   It is strange to see how a liberty and going abroad without purpose of doing anything do lead a man to what is bad, for I was just upon going to Mrs. Martin, where I must of necessity have broken my oath or made a forfeit.

1665-03-09 15:06   I to Westminster, where I hear Mrs. Martin is brought to bed of a boy and christened Charles, which I am very glad of, for I was fearful of being called to be a godfather to it.

1665-03-08 10:17   About 24 and a woman that were in the round-house and coach saved; the rest, being above 300, drowned: the ship breaking all in pieces, with 80 pieces of brass ordnance.

1665-03-08 10:15   Is brought me to the office the sad newes of “The London,” in which Sir J. Lawson’s men were all bringing her from Chatham to the Hope, and thence he was to go to sea in her; but a little a’this side the buoy of the Nower, she suddenly blew up.

1665-03-08 06:06   I rose, and though my pain and tenderness in my testicle remains a little, yet I do verily think that my pain yesterday was nothing else, and therefore I hope my disease of the stone may not return to me.

1665-03-07 14:24   I went to make water, not dreaming of any thing but my testicle that by some accident I might have bruised as I used to do, but in pissing there come from me two stones, I could feel them, but without any pain to me in going out.

1665-03-07 11:52   Going to the office, and I think it was sitting with my back to the fire, it set me in a great rage again, that I could not continue till past noon at the office, but was forced to go home.

1665-03-07 05:50   I was troubled all this night with a pain in my left testicle, that run up presently into my left kidney and there kept akeing all night. In great pain.

1665-03-06 16:15   Home, and there find our new chamber-maid, Mary, come, which instead of handsome, as my wife spoke and still seems to reckon, is a very ordinary wench, I think, and therein was mightily disappointed.

1665-03-06 12:26   Home to dinner, where I saw Besse go away; she having of all wenches that ever lived with us received the greatest love and kindness and good clothes, besides wages, and gone away with the greatest ingratitude.

1665-03-06 09:10   Great preparations for the Duke’s speedy return to sea. I saw him try on his buff coat and hatpiece covered with black velvet. It troubles me more to think of his venture, than of anything else in the whole warr.

1665-03-05 13:32   At dinner my Lord did use me with the greatest solemnity in the world, in carving for me, and nobody else, and calling often to my Lady to cut for me; and all the respect possible.

1665-03-05 12:45   To my Lord Sandwich’s and dined with my Lord; it being the first time he hath dined at home since his coming from sea: and a pretty odd demand it was of my Lord to my Lady before me: “How do you, sweetheart? How have you done all this week?”

1665-03-04 20:22   This day was proclaimed at the ’Change the war with Holland.

1665-03-04 16:37   William Howe come to see me, being come up with my Lord from sea: he is grown a discreet, but very conceited fellow.

1665-03-04 12:13   To the office, where we sat all the morning, I, with being empty and full of ayre and wind, had some pain to-day.

1665-03-04 07:05   Up very betimes, and walked, it being bitter cold, to Ratcliffe, to the plate-maker’s and back again.

1665-03-03 10:20   To see Mrs. Turner, who takes it mighty ill I did not come to dine with the Reader, her husband, which, she says, was the greatest feast that ever was yet kept by a Reader. But I am glad I did not go, which confirms her in an opinion that I am growne proud.

1665-03-03 00:08   Very busy till 12 at night, and vexed at my wife’s staying out so late, she not being at home at 9 o’clock, but at last she is come home, but the reason of her stay I know not yet.

1665-03-02 13:47   Dined with Sir W. Batten (my wife being gone again to-day to buy things, having bought nothing yesterday for lack of Mrs. Pierce’s company).

1665-03-02 05:55   Begun this day to rise betimes before six o’clock, and, going down to call my people, found Besse and the girle with their clothes on, lying within their bedding upon the ground close by the fireside, and a candle burning all night, pretending they would rise to scoure.

1665-03-01 17:55   Here was fine discourses and experiments, but I do lacke philosophy enough to understand them, and so cannot remember them. Among others, a very particular account of the making of the several sorts of bread in France, which is accounted the best place for bread in the world.

1665-03-01 17:06   To the meeting, where Sir G. Carteret’s two sons, his owne, and Sir N. Slaning, were admitted of the society: and this day I did pay my admission money – 40s. – to the society.

1665-03-01 15:29   To Gresham College, where Mr. Hooke read a second very curious lecture about the late Comett; among other things proving very probably that this is the very same Comett that appeared before in the year 1618.

1665-03-01 08:12   My wife did, notwithstanding last night’s falling out, come to peace with me and I with her, but I did boggle mightily at the parting with my money, but at last did give it her, and then she abroad to buy her things.

1665-03-01 08:10   This day being the day that, by a promise, a great while ago, made to my wife, I was to give her 20l. to lay out in clothes against Easter.
