1661-12-31 21:47 I have newly taken a solemn oath about abstaining from plays and wine, which I am resolved to keep according to the letter of the oath.

1661-12-31 21:43 My greatest trouble is, that I have for this last half year been a very great spendthrift in all manner of respects.

1661-12-31 21:41 My chiefest thought is now to get a good wife for Tom, there being one offered by the Joyces, a cozen of theirs, worth 200l. in ready money.

1661-12-31 21:38 I suppose myself to be worth about 500l. clear in the world, and my goods of my house my own.

1661-12-31 21:34 My servants, W. Hewer, Sarah, Nell, and Wayneman: my house at the Navy Office.

1661-12-31 21:32 My health is very good, and so my wife’s in all respects.

1661-12-31 21:30 After my barber had trimmed me, I sat down to end my journell for this year, and my condition at this time, by God’s blessing, is thus:

1661-12-31 19:18 To the office; and there finishing our estimate of the debts of the Navy to this day; and it come to near 374,000l.

1661-12-31 11:28 To the Paynter’s, and my wife sat the last time, and I did tell him some little things to do, that now her picture will please me very well.

1661-12-30 14:10 Here I made them a foolish promise to give them a dinner this day twelvemonth, and so for ever while I live, but I do not intend it.

1661-12-30 13:48 There was about twelve, among others Mr. Bowyer, the old man, and Mr. Faulconberge, Shadwell, Taylor, Spicer, Woodruffe, Servington, &c.

1661-12-30 13:42 A good chine of beef, which with three barrels of oysters and three pullets, and plenty of wine and mirth, was our dinner.

1661-12-30 12:31 To the Mitre, whither I had invited all my old acquaintance of the Exchequer.

1661-12-29 22:02 To the Wardrobe and supped, and staid very long talking with my Lady, who seems to doat every day more and more upon us.

1661-12-29 15:31 I to the Abbey, and there meeting with Mr. Hooper, he took me in among the quire, and there I sang with them their service.

1661-12-28 15:39 Upon a letter from the Duke for the making up of a speedy estimate of all the debts of the Navy, which is put into good forwardness.

1661-12-27 09:37 To my Bookseller’s to bespeak a Stephens’s Thesaurus, for which I offer 4l., to give to Paul’s School.

1661-12-26 22:32 Sir W. Pen and his son and daughter to supper to me to a good turkey, and were merry at cards, and so to bed.

1661-12-26 16:30 The woman of the house told us my boy had called for cakes and ale for himself, at which I was angry, and am resolved to correct him for it.

1661-12-26 15:02 In the alehouse, we eat some cakes and ale, and a washeallbowle woman and girl came to us and sung to us.

1661-12-26 14:09 Sir William and his son and daughter, and I and my wife, to Moorfields to walk; but it was foul weather, and so we went into an alehouse.

1661-12-25 13:22 After dinner my wife comes up to me and all friends again, and she and I to walk upon the leads.

1661-12-25 12:48 Taking occasion from some fault in the meat to complain of my maid’s sluttery, my wife and I fell out, and I to my chamber in a discontent.

1661-12-25 11:02 To church, where at the door of our pew I was fain to stay, because that the sexton had not opened the door.

1661-12-23 19:22 I met with Mr. Crumlum and the second master of Paul’s School, and I took them to the Starr, and I had great pleasure in their company.

1661-12-23 08:14 Took up Mr. Moore, and he and I to Chelsy to my Lord Privy Seal, and there sealed some things, he being to go out of town for all Christmas.

1661-12-22 20:28 Dr. T. Pepys, Will. Joyce, and my brother Tom supped with me. Merry they were, and I seemed to be, but I was not pleased with their company.

1661-12-22 15:08 To church, and there was Capt. Holmes, in his gold-laced suit. I was troubled because of the old business which he attempted upon my wife.

1661-12-22 12:38 To dinner. I took occasion, from the blacknesse of the meat as it came out of the pot, to fall out with my wife and maid for their sluttery.

1661-12-21 14:03 I spoke to Mr. Falconberge to look whether he could out of Domesday Book, give me any thing concerning the sea, and the dominion thereof.

1661-12-21 09:01 I was glad, but only afeard lest any thing of the King’s should force us to go after him to get a seal in the country.

1661-12-21 08:58 To the Privy Seal, where my Lord Privy Seal did tell us he could seal no more, for he goes thirty miles out of town to keep his Christmas.

1661-12-20 20:07 Mr. Moore and I, in the street and on the Exchange, discoursed about Dominion of the Sea, wherein I am lately so much concerned.

1661-12-20 15:46 With Mr. Swan to a tavern, where we had enough of his old simple religious talk, and he is still a coxcomb in these things as he ever was.

1661-12-19 12:41 To very high words, so that, like a passionate fool, I did call my wife whore, for which I was afterwards sorry.

1661-12-19 12:39 My wife and I went by coach home, but I took occasion to fall out with her highly about her ribbands being ill matched and of two colours.

1661-12-19 12:04 My wife and I to the Paynter’s, and there she sat, and I all the while looking over great variety of good prints which he had.

1661-12-18 12:09 At the office upon business extraordinary all the morning.

1661-12-17 22:34 Home to supper and to Selden, “Mare Clausum,” and so to bed.

1661-12-17 16:22 I was sent for to the Privy Seal, whither I was forced to go and stay so long and late that I was much vexed.

1661-12-16 16:49 It being the first time, the pay was doubled, and so to save money, my wife and I went up into the gallery, and there sat and saw very well.

1661-12-16 14:14 To the Opera, where there was a new play (“Cutter of Coleman Street”), made in the year 1658, with reflections much upon the late times.

1661-12-16 04:58 Up by candlelight (which I have not done for many a day), being called upon by one Mr. Bollen by appointment.

1661-12-15 21:24 I am now full of study about writing something about our making of strangers strike to us at sea; and so am reading Selden and Grotius.

1661-12-15 19:00 I am troubled about a difference between my wife and her maid Nell, a simple slut, and I am afeard we shall find her a cross-grained wench.

1661-12-14 11:05 All the morning at home lying in bed with my wife. Such a habit we have got this winter of lying long abed.

1661-12-13 23:18 To the Steelyard, where my Lady Batten and others came to us, and there we drank and had musique and Captain Cox’s company, and he paid all.

1661-12-13 16:04 The Paynter having done, I found that the dead colour of my wife is good, above what I expected, which pleased me exceedingly.

1661-12-13 15:48 To the Paynter’s, and there my wife sat to be drawn, while I stood looking on a pretty lady’s picture, whose face did please me extremely.

1661-12-13 12:05 At home all the morning, being by the cold weather, which for these two days has been frost, in some pain in my bladder.

1661-12-11 22:02 Comes in Captain Cox who promised to be here, but he had been drinking and was very drunk, and so capricious, which I was troubled to see.

1661-12-11 15:35 I went to see Sir W. Pen, who has not been well, and he and I after some talk went to Moorfields, and there walked, though it was very cold.

1661-12-11 10:28 Pegg Kite has married herself to a weaver, an ugly fellow, to her undoing, of which I am glad that I have nothing to do in it.

1661-12-10 13:40 To my Lord Crew’s by coach, and had a stop of an hour and a half, which is a great trouble this Parliament time, but it cannot be helped.

1661-12-09 23:57 Writing letters to my Lord Sandwich and my friends with him at sea, to send by Mons. Eschar, who goes to the Downs to go along to Portugall.

1661-12-09 12:50 I endeavoured to oppose; and was troubled to hear my Lady Wright talk so, though she be a very wise and discreet lady in other things.

1661-12-09 12:49 Lady Wright did talk upon the worth of gallantry and that there was none fit to be courtiers but such as have been abroad and know fashions.

1661-12-08 15:03 A great deal of discourse with my Lady, of the great christening at Mr. Rumbell’s, and courtiers and pomp that was there, which I wonder at.

1661-12-08 11:49 In bed all the morning thinking to take physique, but it being a frost my wife would not have me.

1661-12-07 19:22 Captain Holmes do cry out against Sir John Minnes, as the veriest knave and rogue and coward in the world, which I was glad to hear.

1661-12-07 09:13 I went home, and there found my wife dressing of the German’s head, and so did give him a cravett for his neck, and a crown in his purse.

1661-12-07 08:54 I went into the alehouse at the Stayres and got them to deliver the Captain’s feathers, which one from the Captain was come to demand.

1661-12-07 08:47 The waterman would not take this, but struck him again, and the German drew his sword and ran at one of them, but they were both beaten.

1661-12-07 08:45 I went thither, and found that upon some rude pressing of the watermen to ply the Captain, he struck one of them with his cane.

1661-12-07 08:34 In comes the German again, in a goare of blood, and tells me that he is afeard that the Captain is killed by the watermen at Towre Stayres.

1661-12-07 08:04 I did give Captain Ferrers and the German a mince pie and a collar of brawn and some wine for their breakfast, and were very merry.

1661-12-07 07:22 The German plays bravely. I find by him that my lute is a most excellent lute.

1661-12-07 07:08 I got the German, Emanuel Luffe, to play upon my theorbo, which he did both below and in my wife’s chamber, who was in bed.

1661-12-06 14:42 By appointment came the Governors of the East India Company, to sign and seal the contract between us (in the King’s name) and them.

1661-12-05 17:59 Rode out in Sir W. Pen’s coach, he to Whitehall, and my wife and I to the Opera, and saw “Hamlett” well performed.

1661-12-05 13:49 Sir W. Pen and I dined at my house, and had two mince pies sent thither by our order from the messenger Slater, and so we were very merry.

1661-12-05 10:58 I went early to the Paynter’s and there sat for my picture the fourth time, but it do not yet please me, which do much trouble me.

1661-12-04 18:04 By coach to the Opera and Theatre, but coming too late to both, and myself being a little out of tune we returned.

1661-12-04 10:05 To Whitehall with both Sir Williams, thence by water, where I saw a man lie dead upon Westminster Stairs that had been drowned yesterday.

1661-12-04 09:28 I did complain to Mr. Creed of my dream. He said he had the same pain in his left that I had in my right stone which pleased me to remember.

1661-12-04 07:04 Such apprehension I had of it that when I rose and trussed up myself thinking that it had been no dream.

1661-12-04 07:02 Then I dreamed that I had one of my testicles swelled, and in such pain that I waked with it, and had a great deal of pain there a while.

1661-12-04 06:50 Had a very bad night by dreams of my wife’s riding with me and her horse throwing her and breaking her leg.

1661-12-03 15:04 By water to the office through bridge, being carried by him in oars that the other day rowed in a scull faster than my oars to the Towre.

1661-12-03 13:52 My Lady Wright says there is great happiness in being in the fashion and in variety of fashions, in scorn of others that are not so.

1661-12-03 11:43 To the Paynter’s and sat and had more of my picture done; but it do not please me, for I fear it will not be like me.

1661-12-02 17:34 Called on by Mr. Sanchy and his mistress, and with them by coach to the Opera, to see “The Mad Lover,” but not much pleased with the play.

1661-12-02 09:21 To Savill the painter’s, but he not being well I could do nothing there, and so I returned home.

1661-12-01 21:07 There hath been great clapping up of old statesmen, Ireton, Moyer, and others, and they say, upon a great plot, but I believe no such thing.

1661-12-01 18:31 My brother Tom was with me, and I did talk again to him about Mr. Townsend’s daughter, and I do intend to put the business in hand.

1661-12-01 13:05 We cut a brave collar of brawn which proves good, and opened the glass of girkins which Capt. Cocke did give my wife, which are rare things.
