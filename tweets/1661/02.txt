1661-02-28 21:20 This month ends with two great secrets under dispute but yet known to very few.

1661-02-28 16:00 Made sale of many old stores by the candle. Good sport to see how from a small matter bid they would come to double and treble the price.

1661-02-28 13:15 Notwithstanding my resolution, yet for want of other victualls, I did eat flesh this Lent, but am resolved to eat as little as I can.

1661-02-28 13:00 Capt. Cuttance and I walked from Redriffe to Deptford, where I found both Sir Williams and Sir G. Carteret, and there we dined.

1661-02-28 09:00 Overtook Captain Cuttance and Teddiman in a boat and ashore at Queenhithe, and so to a tavern with them to a barrel of oysters, and so away.

1661-02-27 13:20 I called for a dish of fish, which we had for dinner, this being the first day of Lent; and I do intend to try whether I can keep it or no.

1661-02-27 11:40 Capt. Murford and I had discourse concerning the Light-House, he promising that if I can bring it about, it will be worth 100l. per annum.

1661-02-26 20:20 I sat and talked with my Valentine and my wife a good while, and then saw her home.

1661-02-26 13:50 Looked out at window; saw the flinging at cocks.

1661-02-26 13:10 Back to Mrs. Turner’s, where several friends dined. Very merry and the best fritters that ever I eat in my life.

1661-02-23 22:00 This is now 28 years that I am born. And blessed be God, in a state of full content, and great hopes to be a happy man in all respects.

1661-02-23 17:40 I see the gallants do begin to be tyred with the vanity and pride of the theatre actors who are indeed grown very proud and rich.

1661-02-23 17:20 To the Play-house, and there saw “The Changeling,” the first time it hath been acted these twenty years, and it takes exceedingly.

1661-02-23 14:10 Mr. Townsend tells me that the old man is yet alive in whose place in the Wardrobe he hopes to get my father, which I do resolve to put for.

1661-02-22 18:30 Mrs. The. took us in the coach, calling in Bishopsgate Street, to see a new Harpsicon that she had a making there, but it was not done.

1661-02-22 17:10 Here I staid all the afternoon talking of the King’s being married, which is now the town talk, but I believe false.

1661-02-22 14:40 I with The. Turner to her mother, good woman, whom I had not seen through my neglect this half year, but she would not be angry with me.

1661-02-21 10:40 So to the Hall and called for some caps that I have a making there, and here met with Mr. Hawley, and with him to Will’s and drank.

1661-02-19 14:00 To my Lord’s and found him dined, and so I lost my dinner, but I staid and played with him and Mr. Child, &c., some things of four parts.

1661-02-19 12:30 The Comptroller tells me, he is sure that the King is not yet married, as it is said; nor that it is known who he will have.

1661-02-19 10:55 Mr. Slingsby says Blondeau will shortly come over, and then we shall have it better, and the best in the world.

1661-02-19 10:40 Mr. Slingsby showed me the stamps of the King’s new coyne; which is strange to see, how good they are in the stamp and bad in the money.

1661-02-18 20:30 It is much talked that the King is already married to the niece of the Prince de Ligne, and that he hath two sons already by her.

1661-02-17 11:10 A most tedious, unreasonable, and impertinent sermon, by an Irish Doctor. His text was “Scatter them, O Lord, that delight in war.”

1661-02-16 17:10 I dined with my Lord and then to the Theatre, where I saw “The Virgin Martyr,” a good but too sober a play for the company.

1661-02-16 11:50 I did get my Lord to sign a bill (which do make my heart merry) for 60l, in consideration of my work extraordinary at sea this last voyage.

1661-02-15 16:30 I found myself to be clear (as I think) 350l. in the world, besides my goods in my house and all things paid for.

1661-02-15 16:10 At the office all the morning, and in the afternoon at making up my accounts for my Lord to-morrow.

1661-02-14 22:15 The great preparation for the King’s crowning is now much thought upon and talked of.

1661-02-14 22:00 The talk is, who the King is like to have for his Queen – and whether Lent shall be kept with the strictness of the King’s proclamation.

1661-02-14 14:15 The first time I ever carried my wife a-ship-board, as also my boy Wayneman, who hath all this day been called young Pepys.

1661-02-14 13:50 To Woolwich, on board the Rose-bush, where we had a very fine dinner, dressed on shore, and great mirth and all things successfull.

1661-02-14 11:00 We, with a great deal of company, went down by our barge to Deptford, and there only went to see how forward Mr. Pett’s yacht is.

1661-02-14 08:50 To Sir W. Batten’s. I asked whether they that opened the door was a man or a woman, and Mingo answered a woman, which made me laugh.

1661-02-13 18:20 My uncle Wight drank with us, and with him to Sir W. Batten’s, whither I sent for my wife, and we chose Valentines against to-morrow.

1661-02-13 13:40 Dined at home, and poor Mr. Wood with me, who after dinner would have borrowed money of me, but I would lend none.

1661-02-12 19:50 Creed and I (the other being lost in the crowd) to drink a cup of ale at Temple Bar, and there we parted, and I went home.

1661-02-12 17:00 To the Theatre, and there saw “The Scornfull Lady,” now done by a woman, which makes the play appear much better than ever it did to me.

1661-02-12 14:50 The two others and I after a great dispute whither to go, went by water to Salsbury Court play-house, where not liking to sit, we went out.

1661-02-12 13:50 I and Mr. Pickering, Creed, and Captain Ferrers to the Leg in the Palace to dinner, where strange Pickering’s impertinences.

1661-02-11 16:50 Young Mr. Reeve did show me many pretty pleasures in perspectives, that I have not seen before, and I did buy a little glass of him.

1661-02-10 20:20 My wife and I did please ourselves talking of our going into France, which I hope to effect this summer.

1661-02-10 17:30 Took physique all day, and, God forgive me, did spend it in reading of some little French romances.

1661-02-10 12:00 One came to ask for Mrs. Hunt that was here yesterday, and it seems is not come home yet, which makes us afraid of her.

1661-02-09 17:20 Creed and I to Whitefriars’ to the Play-house, and saw “The Mad Lover,” the first time I ever saw it acted, which I like pretty well.

1661-02-08 16:15 Capt. Mootham and Mr. Dawes (who have been slaves there) did make me acquainted with conditions there: eating nothing but bread and water.

1661-02-08 16:00 We spent till four o’clock, telling stories of Algiers, and the manner of the life of slaves there!

1661-02-08 12:30 I met with many sea commanders, and among others Captain Cuttle, and Curtis, and Mootham, and I, went to the Fleece Tavern to drink.

1661-02-07 16:20 I dined with my Lord, and then with Mr. Shepley and Creed (who talked very high of France for a fine country) to the tavern and then I home.

1661-02-07 11:10 My Lord had dined at Havre de Grace, and came to the Downs the next day, and lay at Canterbury that night; and so to Dartford.

1661-02-07 10:50 After a walk to my Lord’s; where, while I and my Lady were in her chamber in talk, in comes my Lord from sea, to our great wonder.

1661-02-06 09:20 Called up by my Cozen Snow, who sat by me while I was trimmed, and then I drank with him, he desiring a courtesy for a friend.

1661-02-05 17:10 We saw Argalus and Parthenia, but though pleasant for the dancing and singing, I do not find good for any wit or design therein.

1661-02-05 12:00 I saw the heads of Cromwell, Bradshaw, and Ireton, set up upon the further end of Westminster Hall.

1661-02-05 10:20 I went to Will’s, and found Shaw and Ashwell and Bragrave, who by cursing and swearing made me weary of his company and so I went away.

1661-02-04 21:40 We sat late, talking with my Lady and others and Dr. Whistler, who I found good company and a very ingenious man.

1661-02-04 18:20 Home, and then with my wife to see Sir W. Batten, who could not be with us this day being ill, but we found him at cards.

1661-02-04 14:40 I took pleasure to take the forfeits of the ladies who would not do their duty by kissing of them.

1661-02-04 14:10 I to the Dolphin where Sir William Pen and the Comptroller and several others were, men and women; and we had a very great and merry dinner.

1661-02-03 16:40 Sir Thomas Crew’s Pedro, with two of his countrymen more, did last night kill one soldier of four that quarrelled with them in the street.

1661-02-03 14:10 My Lord of Norwich at an audience before the King of France made the Duke of Anjou cry by making ugly faces as he was stepping to the King.

1661-02-03 12:15 To White Hall; where I heard the trumpets and kettle-drums, then the other drums, which are much cried up, though I think it vulgar musique.

1661-02-03 11:35 Mr. Fuller shewing among other things that we are to go to law never to revenge, but only to repayre, which I think a good distinction.

1661-02-03 11:20 I heard Mr. Thomas Fuller preach at the Savoy upon our forgiving of other men’s trespasses.

1661-02-03 09:10 This day I first begun to go forth in my coat and sword, as the manner now among gentlemen is.

1661-02-02 22:20 In the evening comes Sir W. Pen, pretty merry, to sit with me and talk, which we did for an hour or two, and so good night, and I to bed.
