1661-05-31 21:10   Great talk how the Parliament intend to make a collection of free gifts to the King through the Kingdom; I think it will not come to much.

1661-05-31 10:55   I did talk to my mother so as did not indeed become me, but I could not help it, she being so unsufferably foolish and simple.

1661-05-31 10:35   Indeed my mother is grown now so pettish that I know not how my father is able to bear with it.

1661-05-31 10:30   I went to my father’s, but to my great grief I found my father and mother in a great deal of discontent one with another.

1661-05-30 22:00   This day, I hear, the Parliament have ordered a bill to be brought in for the restoring the Bishops to the House of Lords.

1661-05-30 20:40   The Comptroller and I to the Coffee House, and there sat a great while talking of many things.

1661-05-30 11:00   I took boat at Arundell stairs, and put in at Milford and there behind the doore of the stairs shit, there being a house of office there.

1661-05-30 10:30   To Greatorex, who took me to Arundell-House, and there showed me some fine flowers in his garden, and all the fine statues in the gallery.

1661-05-30 09:20   I like my Lord’s contrivance of the door to come out round and not square as they used to do.

1661-05-30 09:10   To the Wardrobe and there, with my Lord, went into his new barge to try her, and found her a good boat.

1661-05-29 17:22   We beat them. But it cost me the spoiling of my clothes and velvet coat with dirt.

1661-05-29 17:20   We had great sport to try who should drive fastest, Sir W. Batten’s coach, or Sir W. Pen’s chariott, they having four, and we two horses.

1661-05-29 16:00   We went to Mrs. Shipman’s, who is a great butter-woman. I did see the most of milk and cream, and the cleanest that ever I saw in my life.

1661-05-29 14:50   For as much I expected to give the name to the child, but did not (it being called John), I forbore then to give my plate till another time.

1661-05-29 14:35   One passage of a lady that eat wafers with her dog did displease me. I did give the midwife 10s. and the nurse 5s. and the maid 2s.

1661-05-29 14:20   We were with the woman in Mrs. Brown’s chamber; whether we carried ourselves well or ill, I know not; I was directed by young Mrs. Batten.

1661-05-29 14:00   To Mrs. Browne’s, where Sir W. Pen and I were godfathers, and Mrs. Jordan and Shipman godmothers to her boy.

1661-05-29 07:10   Having made myself fine, and put six spoons and a porringer of silver in my pocket to give away to-day, Sir W. Pen and I took coach.

1661-05-28 14:40   To Cheapside about buying a piece of plate to give away to-morrow to Mrs. Browne’s child.

1661-05-28 10:50   We saw the hangman burn, by vote of Parliament, two old acts, the one for constituting us a Commonwealth, and the others I have forgot.

1661-05-28 10:20   To the Wardrobe, and thence to a little alehouse hard by, to drink with John Bowles, who is now going to Hinchinbroke this day.

1661-05-27 22:10   Home and to bed.

1661-05-27 17:20   Sir George Carteret did inquire into the naming of the maisters for this fleet, and was very angry that they were named as they are.

1661-05-27 13:50   There coming to us Captain Ferrers, this being the first day of his going abroad since his leap a week ago, which I was greatly glad to see.

1661-05-27 13:30   To the Legg. There I found both Mr. Pierces, Mr. Rolt, formerly too great a man to meet upon such even terms, and there we dined very merry.

1661-05-26 16:00   I heard how Mrs. Browne, Sir W. Batten’s sister, is brought to bed, and I to be one of the godfathers, which I could not nor did deny.

1661-05-26 15:40   I to Sir W. Batten’s, where I have on purpose made myself a great stranger, only to get a high opinion a little more of myself in them.

1661-05-26 13:10   Dined with my wife alone at home pleasing myself in that my house do begin to look as if at last it would be in good order.

1661-05-25 18:10   Home, where I found all clean, and the hearth and range, as it is now enlarged, set up, which pleases me very much.

1661-05-24 12:10   This is the first time that I do find myself to be clearly worth 500l. in money, besides all my goods in my house, &c.

1661-05-23 20:00   A holy-day through the town; it pleased me to see the boys walk in procession with their broom-staffs in their hands, as I had long ago.

1661-05-23 13:50   Dr. Bates’s singularity in not rising up nor drinking the King’s nor other healths at the table was very much observed.

1661-05-23 13:10   I had very good discourse with Mr. Ashmole, wherein he did assure me that frogs and many insects do often fall from the sky, ready formed.

1661-05-23 12:30   Shifted myself into my black silk suit, and so to my Lord Mayor’s, with a great deal of honourable company, and great entertainment.

1661-05-23 10:25   Jonas Moore spoke very many things, not so much to prove the Scripture false as that the time therein is not well computed nor understood.

1661-05-23 10:10   Jonas Moore, the mathematician, did make us fully believe that England and France were once the same continent, by very good arguments.

1661-05-22 22:10   Before I went to bed the barber came to trim me and wash me, and so to bed, in order to my being clean to-morrow.

1661-05-22 12:50   By water to the Wardrobe where my Lord and all the officers of the Wardrobe dined, and several other friends of my Lord, at a venison pasty.

1661-05-21 15:40   To my father’s, and did give order about some clothes to be made, and did buy a new hat, cost between 20 and 30 shillings, at Mr. Holden’s.

1661-05-21 13:30   While we were upon the water, one of the greatest showers of rain fell that ever I saw.

1661-05-21 13:10   Took barge again, and were overtaken by the King in his barge, he having been down the river with his yacht this day for pleasure to try it.

1661-05-21 12:20   We took boat to Woolwich, where we gave order for the fitting out of some more ships. And then to Deptford, where we staid and did the same.

1661-05-21 08:50   With Sir R. Slingsby (and Major Waters the deaf gentleman, his friend, for company’s sake) to the Victualling-office.

1661-05-20 16:40   I found Sir Williams both, choosing of masters for the new fleet of ships that is ordered to be set forth, and Pen in an ugly humour.

1661-05-20 14:50   Mr. Creed and I to an ordinary to dinner, and after dinner to the Mitre, and there sat drinking while it rained very much.

1661-05-19 18:10   I am troubled to see my father so much decay of a suddain, as he do both in his seeing and hearing.

1661-05-19 14:46   My Lord bid us carry Capt. Ferrers up, which, by our strength, we did and laid him in East’s bed, by the door; where he lay in great pain.

1661-05-19 14:41   So we went down into the garden and dragged Capt. Ferrers to the bench, where he looked like a dead man, but could not stir.

1661-05-19 14:39   We found Capt. Ferrers crawled upon his knees, but could not rise.

1661-05-19 14:38   The balcone windows were open and Capt. Ferrers leaps down into the garden: the most desperate frolic that ever I saw in my life.

1661-05-19 14:33   I, giving Capt. Ferrers some hopes, he grew so mad with joy that he fell a-dancing and leaping like a madman.

1661-05-19 14:30   To my Lord’s. Capt. Ferrers is in doubt whether he shall go to sea or no, but swears that he would go if he were sure never to come back.

1661-05-19 11:50   Into the garden, and walked a turn or two, but found it not so fine a place as I always took it for by the outside.

1661-05-19 11:00   At York House I found them at mass, it being the Spanish ambassodors; and so I go into one of the gallerys, and there heard two masses done.

1661-05-18 17:40   I home, where I staid all the afternoon in the garden reading “Faber Fortunae” with great pleasure.

1661-05-18 10:50   At Westminster, where it was very pleasant to see the Hall in the condition it is now with the judges on the benches at the further end.

1661-05-18 09:35   Upon the start, the wager boats fell foul one of another, till at last one of them gives over, pretending foul play, and all our sport lost.

1661-05-18 09:30   Spying of Payne in a gully, I went into him, and there staid, thinking to have gone to Chelsy with them.

1661-05-18 09:15   Being through bridge I found the Thames full of boats and gallys, and upon inquiry found that there was a wager to be run this morning.

1661-05-18 09:00   Towards Westminster, by water, and was fain to stand upon one of the piers about the bridge, before the men could drag their boat through.

1661-05-17 22:20   Home to my musique, and my wife and I sat singing in my chamber a good while together, and then to bed.

1661-05-17 13:40   To our dinner we had a fellow play upon the bagpipes and whistle like a bird exceeding well, and I had a fancy to learn to whistle as he do.

1661-05-16 20:50   We, with the rest of the servants in the hall, sat down and eat of the best cold meats that ever I eat on in all my life.

1661-05-16 19:40   I took Mr. Creed by water to the Wardrobe with me, and there we found my Lord newly gone away with the Duke of Ormond and some others.

1661-05-16 17:30   To the Theatre, and there saw the latter end of “The Mayd’s Tragedy,” which I never saw before, and methinks it is too sad and melancholy.

1661-05-16 15:20   Quite contrary to my expectations, the Lords did treat me civilly, telling me that what they had done was out of zeal to the King’s service.

1661-05-16 14:50   I went in my velvet coat by water to the Savoy, and there, having staid a good while, I was called into the Lords.

1661-05-15 22:10   To bed, being in great fear because of the shavings which lay all up and down the house and cellar, for fear of fire.

1661-05-15 16:15   I give the men a surly answer, and they went away to complain, but I resolve to go to-morrow myself to these Lords and answer them.

1661-05-15 16:10   There came two men with an order from a Committee of Lords to demand some books of me out of the office.

1661-05-15 14:20   Home and found all my joyner’s work now done, but only a small job or two, which please me very well.

1661-05-14 22:40   Finding my head grow weak now-a-days if I come to drink wine and therefore hope I shall leave it off of myself, which I pray God I could do.

1661-05-14 21:50   My uncle Wight, Mr. Talbot, and others were with us, and we were pretty merry.

1661-05-14 19:40   Mr. Shepley came to me for some money, and so he and I to the Mitre, and there we had good wine and a gammon of bacon.

1661-05-14 09:10   My Lord spoke slightingly of Mr. Creed, as that he had no opinion of him, but only he was forced to make use of him because of his accounts.

1661-05-14 08:40   My Lord told me of his intention to get the Muster Master’s place for Mr. Pierce, the purser, who he has a mind to carry to sea with him.

1661-05-13 20:10   The office being done I went home and took pleasure to see my work draw to an end.

1661-05-13 13:00   Mr. Creed and I went to the ordinary behind the Exchange, where we lately were, but I do not like it so well as I did.

1661-05-12 15:45   Methought it was a poor dry sermon. And I am afeard my former high esteem of Dr. Fuller preaching was more out of opinion than judgment.

1661-05-12 15:40   At the Savoy heard Dr Fuller preach upon David’s words, “I will wait with patience all the days of my appointed time until my change comes.”

1661-05-12 06:50   I put in a vent into the hole to keep it open till all the matter be come out, and so I question not that my wife will soon be well again.

1661-05-12 06:45   My wife had a very troublesome night and in great pain, but her swelling broke, and she was in great ease presently as she useth to be.

1661-05-11 20:50   Mr. Hater brought my last quarter’s salary, of which I was very glad, because I have lost my first bill for it.

1661-05-11 20:20   I went home, and there staid and saw my workmen follow their work, which this night is brought to a very good condition.

1661-05-11 11:10   To a barber’s, where I had my haire cut, in which I am lately become a little curious, finding that the length of it do become me very much.

1661-05-10 18:40   Came Mr. Blackburn and Creed to see me, and I took them to the Dolphin, and there drank a great deal of Rhenish wine with them and so home.

1661-05-10 16:10   At the office all the morning, and the afternoon among my workmen with great pleasure, because being near an end of their work.

1661-05-10 14:30   Mr. Hater received for me the 225l. due upon Mr. Creed’s bill in which I am concerned so much, which do make me very glad.

1661-05-09 22:30   By and by comes in my Lord, and so, after looking over my accounts, I returned home, being a dirty and dark walk. So to bed.

1661-05-09 21:50   I walked to the Wardrobe, and my Lady shewed me all the lodgings as they are now fitted, and they seem pretty pleasant.

1661-05-09 14:40   I meeting with Mr. Childe took him to the Swan Tavern in King Street, and there did give him a tankard of white wine and sugar.

1661-05-09 11:50   My wife being ill and in great pain with her old pain, which troubled me much because that my house is in this condition of dirt.

1661-05-08 20:42   It vexed me to see how my uncle writes to me, as if he were not able to buy my Cozen Perkin a fiddle. But I intend tomorrow to send him one.

1661-05-08 20:40   A letter from my uncle, to beg a fiddle for my Cozen Perkin, whose mill hath lately broke down. Now he hath nothing to live by but fiddling.

1661-05-08 19:10   Comes my wife not well, having had a tooth drawn out to-day, which do trouble me, the more because I am now in the greatest of all my dirt.

1661-05-08 18:20   All this day I staid at home with my workmen without eating anything, and took much pleasure to see my work go forward.

1661-05-08 08:20   Came my brother John to take his leave of me, he being to return to Cambridge. I did give him good counsell and 20s, and so he went away.

1661-05-07 21:10   Sent my Lord a letter to excuse myself for not going to-morrow to the Hope, whither he is to go to see in what condition the fleet is in.

1661-05-07 18:10   Home and staid among my workmen all day, and took order for things for the finishing of their work.

1661-05-07 14:00   An excellent droll, my host, his wife so fine a woman; sung and played so well that I staid a great while and drunk a great deal of wine.

1661-05-07 13:40   Mr. Creed carried me to an ordinary by the Old Exchange, where we come a little too late, but we had very good cheer for our 18d. a-piece.

1661-05-07 09:40   We were stopped by the City traynebands, who go in solemnity and pomp to muster before the King and the Duke. Shops are shut up every where.

1661-05-06 21:50   I hear that the Duke of York’s son is dead, which I believe will please every body; the Duke and his Lady are not much troubled at it.

1661-05-06 21:20   I went and sat till late with my Lady Batten, both the Sir Williams being gone this day to pay off some ships at Deptford.

1661-05-06 12:00   Home, where I was much troubled to see no more work done in my absence than there was, but it could not be helped.

1661-05-05 21:10   In the banquet house my wife and I did talk high, she against and I for Mrs. Pierce (that she was a beauty), till we were both angry.

1661-05-05 15:40   In the garden we played the fool a great while, trying who of Mr. Creed or I could go best over the edge of an old fountain well.

1661-05-05 11:30   Mr. Creed and I went to the red-faced Parson’s church, and heard a good sermon of him, better than I looked for.

1661-05-04 22:15   We lay at the Red Lyon, the best Inn, and lay in the room the King lately lay in.

1661-05-04 22:00   So to supper being very merry about our discourse with the Drawers concerning the minister of the Town, with a red face and a girdle.

1661-05-04 17:00   And so to Gilford. We had time to see the Hospital, built by Archbishop Abbott, and the free school and were civilly treated by the Mayster.

1661-05-03 22:20   Here my wife and I lay in the room the Queen lately lay at her going into France.

1661-05-03 17:30   To Petersfield, having nothing more of trouble in all my journey, but the exceeding unmannerly and most epicure-like palate of Mr. Creed.

1661-05-03 13:10   To the payhouse, and paid off the ship, and so to a short dinner. Then took coach, leaving Mrs. Hater to stay with her husband’s friends.

1661-05-03 07:50   To walk with Mr. Creed, and it was in his and some others’ thoughts to have got me made free of the town but the Mayor, it seems, unwilling.

1661-05-02 16:20   To see the Montagu, which is a fine ship, and so to the town again, then to see the room where the Duke of Buckingham was killed by Felton.

1661-05-02 15:40   Brought them all to dinner with me, and treated them handsomely; after dinner to the Yard, and there we made the sale of the old provisions.

1661-05-02 11:10   All the officers of the Yard to see me with great respect, and I walked with them to the Dock, and much pleased with the sight of the place.

1661-05-01 21:20   Several officers of the Yard came to see us to-night, and merry we were, but troubled to have no better lodgings.

1661-05-01 13:50   We set forth again, and so to Portsmouth, seeming to me to be a very pleasant and strong place.

1661-05-01 10:00   Bated at Petersfield, in the room which the King lay in lately at his being there. Here very merry, and played us and our wives at bowls.
