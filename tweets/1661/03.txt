1661-03-31 22:10   Finding Will abroad at Sir W. Batten’s, I took occasion to be angry with him, and so to prayers and to bed.

1661-03-31 16:20   To Mrs. Turner’s, where I could not woo The. to give me a lesson upon the harpsicon and was angry at it.

1661-03-31 13:40   Home and dined with my wife, she staying at home, being unwilling to dress herself, the house being all dirty.

1661-03-31 11:30   At church, where a stranger preached like a fool.

1661-03-30 16:30   Into London and drank a pint of wine with Mr. Creed, and so home and sent a letter and the bonds to my uncle to sign for my Lord.

1661-03-30 15:50   So to my Lord’s, and there got him to sign a bond to him, which I also signed too, and he did sign counter security to us both.

1661-03-30 15:10   So to my coz. Tho. Pepys, and got him to promise me 1,000l. to lend my Lord upon his and my uncle Robert’s and my security.

1661-03-30 09:50   At the office we and Sir W. Rider to advise what sort of provisions to get ready for these ships going to the Indies.

1661-03-29 21:50   Home and there put some papers in order, and not knowing what to do, the house being so dirty, I went to bed.

1661-03-29 14:40   Hither came letters from above for the fitting of two other ships for the East Indies, and so we got orders for the Hampshire and Nonsuch. 

1661-03-29 10:20   Sir W. Pen was sent to Chatham to get two ships in readiness to go to the East Indies upon some design against the Dutch but it is a secret.

1661-03-28 21:40   Home, where I found a great deal of work done to-day, and also 70l. paid me upon the bill of exchange that I have had hopes of so long.

1661-03-28 17:00   With Mr. Shepley to the Theatre and saw “Rollo” ill acted.

1661-03-27 23:30   Home, where I found my wife all day in her chamber. So to bed.

1661-03-27 22:20   We made Mingo, Sir W. Batten’s black, and Jack, Sir W. Pen’s, dance, and it was strange how the first did dance with a great deal of skill.

1661-03-27 22:00   In our mirth I sang and sometimes fiddled, and we fell to dancing, the first time that ever I did in my life, which I did wonder to see.

1661-03-27 14:20   To the Dolphin to a dinner of Mr. Harris’s, where Sir Williams both and my Lady Batten, and her two daughters, where a great deal of mirth.

1661-03-27 12:10   I found my stairs quite broke down, that I could not get up but by a ladder.

1661-03-27 09:40   My brother Tom comes to me, and I looked over my old clothes and did give him a suit of black stuff clothes and a hat and some shoes.

1661-03-26 17:30   Mrs. Pierce and her husband and I and my wife to Salisbury Court, and saw “The Bondman” done to admiration.

1661-03-26 14:10   Very merry at dinner. Mrs. Turner and her company eat no flesh this Lent, and I had a great deal of flesh which made their mouths water.

1661-03-26 12:20   To my father’s, where Mrs. Turner, The, Joyce, Mr. Morrice, Mr. Armiger, Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, and his wife, and my father and mother.

1661-03-26 11:50   All this morning I staid at home looking after my workmen to my great content about my stairs.

1661-03-26 09:10   This is my great day that three years ago I was cut of the stone, and, blessed be God, I do yet find myself very free from pain again.

1661-03-26 07:50   Up early to do business in my study.

1661-03-25 23:50   I to bed, being pleased well with the work that my workmen have begun to-day.

1661-03-25 23:20   Many other discourses, what and how many ways there are for poor children to get their livings honestly.

1661-03-25 23:05   I had great discourse with they boy how he could get sometimes three or four bushells of rags in a day, and got 3d. a bushell for them.

1661-03-25 22:50   So homewards and took up a boy that had a lanthorn, that was picking up of rags, and got him to light me home.

1661-03-25 21:40   I to Mrs. Turner, and there staid talking. The. Turner being in a chafe, about being disappointed of a room to stand in at the Coronacion.

1661-03-25 15:10   I took Mr. Salisbury to Whitehall with me by water, but he would not by any means be moved to go through bridge.

1661-03-25 14:20   Comes Mr. Salisbury to see me, and shewed me a face or two of his paynting, and indeed I perceive that he will be a great master.

1661-03-25 10:15   With other work that I have to do, I doubt will keep me this two months and so long I shall be all in dirt.

1661-03-25 10:00   This morning came workmen to begin the making of me a new pair of stairs up out of my parler.

1661-03-24 18:00   After a walk in the garden Sir W. Batten’s two daughters came and sat with us a while, and I then up to my chamber to read.

1661-03-24 15:30   With Sir W. Batten and my Lady to dinner, where very merry, and then to church again, where Mr. Mills made a good sermon.

1661-03-23 20:20   Crofton, the great Presbyterian minister that had lately preached so highly against Bishops, is clapped up this day into the Tower.

1661-03-23 17:05   The boy that was to sing a song, not singing it right, his master fell about his ears and beat him so, it put the whole house in an uprore.

1661-03-23 16:50   The play, which is called “All’s lost by Lust,” poorly done; and with so much disorder.

1661-03-23 15:15   At last into the Pitt, where I think there was not above ten more than myself, and not one hundred in the whole house.

1661-03-23 14:55   Strange the confusion there is among them in fitting themselves, especially here, where the clothes are poor, and the actors common fellows.

1661-03-23 14:40   At last came back again and went in, where I was led by a seaman that knew me, but is here as a servant, up to the tireing-room.

1661-03-23 14:00   To the Red Bull, but coming too soon I went out again and walked all up and down the Charterhouse yard and Aldersgate street.

1661-03-22 22:00   At Sir W. Batten’s we supped, and thence to bed, my head akeing mightily through the wine that I drank to-day.

1661-03-22 17:10   We set out again in a coach home, and were very merry all the way.

1661-03-22 13:30   We met with Sir W. Batten, and some company along with him, who had assisted him in his election at Rochester; we dined and were very merry.

1661-03-22 08:00   I got a horseback, and my Lady and her two daughters, and Sir W. Pen into coach, and so over London Bridge, and thence to Dartford.

1661-03-22 06:50   My Lady Batten knocked at her door that comes into one of my chambers, and called me to know whether I and my wife were ready to go.

1661-03-21 23:10   After I was a-bed Sir W. Pen sent to desire me to go with him to-morrow morning to meet Sir W. Batten coming from Rochester.

1661-03-21 20:50   This day I saw the Florence Ambassador go to his audience, the weather very foul, and yet he and his company very gallant.

1661-03-21 15:00   Here I staid with Mr. Creed all the morning. At noon dined with my Lord, who was merry, and after dinner we sang and fiddled a great while.

1661-03-21 11:20   To Whitehall to my Lord, and there did stay with him a good while discoursing upon his accounts.

1661-03-20 18:20   The Bishops are so high, that very few do love them.

1661-03-20 17:33   Men that are so far from being episcopall that they are thought to be Anabaptists; and chosen with a great deal of zeal.

1661-03-20 17:20   The great talk of the town is the strange election that the City of London made yesterday for Parliament-men; viz. Fowke, Love, Jones, and …

1661-03-20 16:30   I found Sir W. Pen with Mr. Coventry teaching of him upon the map to understand Jamaica.

1661-03-19 22:30   With Mr. Creed and young Mr. Jones to Penell’s in Fleet Street, and there we drank and talked a good while, and so I home and to bed.

1661-03-19 17:20   We saw “The Bondman” acted most excellently, and though I have seen it often, I am every time more and more pleased with Betterton’s action.

1661-03-18 22:35   I do find myself to become more and more thoughtful about getting of money than ever heretofore.

1661-03-18 22:20   To bed with my head and mind full of business, which do a little put me out of order.

1661-03-18 18:10   I found in the newes-booke that Roger Pepys is chosen at Cambridge for the town, the first place we hear of to have made their choice yet.

1661-03-18 15:40   Yesterday it was said was to be the day that the Princess Henrietta was to marry the Duke d’Anjou in France.

1661-03-18 10:20   I made inquiry at Greatorex’s and in other places to hear of Mr. Barlow (thinking to hear that he is dead), but I find the contrary.

1661-03-18 09:00   This morning early Sir W. Batten went to Rochester, where he expects to be chosen Parliament man.

1661-03-17 21:00   To supper at Sir W. Batten’s again, where my wife by chance fell down and hurt her knees exceedingly. 

1661-03-17 14:30   My wife and I dined upon a chine of beef at Sir W. Batten’s, so to church again.

1661-03-17 11:20   At church in the morning, a stranger preached a good honest and painfull sermon.

1661-03-16 20:20   By and by Will comes and I let him in, and he did tell me that he was at Guildhall helping to pay off the seamen, and cast the books late.

1661-03-16 20:00   So home, and was very much troubled that Will staid out late, and went to bed early, intending not to let him come in.

1661-03-16 17:30   To Whitehall to my Lord’s, and dined with him, and so to Whitefriars and saw “The Spanish Curate,” in which I had no great content.

1661-03-15 20:50   At noon Sir Williams both and I at a fish dinner at the Dolphin, given us by two tax merchants, and merry we were till night, and so home.

1661-03-14 19:30   Mr. Creed did ask my advice about his amours, and I did give him it, which was to enquire into the condition of his competitor.

1661-03-14 17:00   Dined with my Lord and Lady, and so with Mr. Creed to the Theatre, and there saw “King and no King,” well acted.

1661-03-14 11:30   Mr. Creed told me a long story of his amours at Portsmouth to one of Mrs. Boat’s daughters, which was very pleasant.

1661-03-14 10:40   At last to my content did conclude to have my hand to all the bills for these provisions and Mr. Turner to purvey them.

1661-03-14 10:20   With Sir W. Batten and Pen to Mr. Coventry’s, and there had a dispute about my claim to the place of Purveyor of Petty-provisions.

1661-03-13 13:40   Mrs. Turner, The, Joyce, and Mr. Armiger, and my father and mother dined with me, where they stayed till I was weary of their company.

1661-03-13 07:20   Early up in the morning to read “The Seaman’s Grammar and Dictionary” I lately have got, which do please me exceeding well.

1661-03-12 14:40   To Guildhall. Set my hand to the book for my sea pay and blessed be God! they have cast me at midshipman’s pay, which do make my heart glad.

1661-03-11 20:50   Among other things my wife hath got her teeth new done by La Roche, and are indeed now pretty handsome, and I was much pleased with it.

1661-03-11 17:20   To the theatre, and there saw “Love’s Mistress” done by them, which I do not like in some things as well as their acting in Salsbury Court.

1661-03-10 15:40   To church, and there heard one Castle, whom I knew of my year at Cambridge. He made a dull sermon.

1661-03-10 13:00   Dined at home on a poor Lenten dinner of coleworts and bacon.

1661-03-09 13:40   My Lord asked me what the world spoke of the King’s marriage. Which I answering as one that knew nothing, he enquired no further of me.

1661-03-09 12:20   To my Lord’s, where we found him lately come from Hinchingbroke, where he left my uncle very well, but my aunt not likely to live.

1661-03-09 11:35   Which Mr. Creed did not seem unwilling to, and therefore I am very glad it is out.

1661-03-09 11:22   Mr. Creed giving me an occasion I told him of my intention to get 60l. paid me by him for a gratuity for my labour extraordinary at sea.

1661-03-09 11:10   To Whitehall and there with Mr. Creed took a most pleasant walk for two hours in the park, which is now a very fair place.

1661-03-08 22:20   Sir William Wale carried Sir William Batten and I home in his coach, and so I almost overcome with drink went to bed.

1661-03-08 15:00   After dinner, to drink all the afternoon.

1661-03-08 14:10   Where great good cheer. High company; among others the Duchess of Albemarle, who is ever a plain homely dowdy.

1661-03-08 13:50   Mr. Mount, my Lady Duchess’s gentleman usher, stood waiting at table, whom I ever thought a man so much above me in all respects.

1661-03-08 12:40   I was much contented to ride in such state into the Tower, and be received among such high company.

1661-03-08 12:00   At noon Sir W. Batten, Col. Slingsby and I by coach to the Tower, to Sir John Robinson’s, to dinner.

1661-03-08 01:55   I wrote a letter to Mr. Waith to send to-morrow morning for him to take my money for me, and so with good words I thought to coy with him.

1661-03-08 01:20   Met with ill news that my hopes of getting some money for the Charles were spoiled through Mr. Waith’s perverseness, which did vex me.

1661-03-07 22:20   I met Spicer, D. Vines, and a company more of my old acquaintance and went to drink some ale, and there we staid playing the fool till late.

1661-03-07 17:40   I took Mr. Moore to the Fleece tavern, where the pretty woman that Luellin lately told me the story of dwells, but I could not see her.

1661-03-07 15:20   To Mr. Crew to Mr. Moore, and he and I to London to Guildhall to see the seamen paid off, but could not without trouble.

1661-03-07 08:30   Sir Williams both went to Woolwich to sell some old provisions there.

1661-03-06 21:00   My Lady come home out of the country ill by reason of much rain that has fallen lately, and the waters being very high.

1661-03-06 13:50   At dinner Sir W. Batten took me and my wife to his house to dinner, my Lady being in the country, where we had a good Lenten dinner.

1661-03-05 22:00   So home, and I with my head full of thoughts how to get a little present money, I eat a bit of bread and cheese, and so to bed.

1661-03-05 18:20   To the office, where Sir Williams both and I set about making an estimate of all the officers’ salaries in ordinary in the Navy.

1661-03-05 16:30   To the Commissioners of Parliament, but I was troubled to see how high they carry themselves, when in good truth nobody cares for them.

1661-03-05 14:00   To my Lady’s and dined, and had much pleasant discourse with my Lady, my esteem growing every day higher and higher in her and my Lord.

1661-03-04 16:10   To dinner and so to Whitehall to Mr. Coventry about several businesses, and then with Mr. Moore, who went with me to drink a cup of ale.

1661-03-04 11:50   To the office all the forenoon.

1661-03-04 08:15   And a brave George, all of diamonds, and this with the greatest expressions of love and confidence that I could imagine or hope for.

1661-03-04 08:03   Before my Lord's going he did give me some jewells to keep for him, viz., that the King of Sweden did give him, with his picture in it.

1661-03-04 07:50   My Lord went to Hinchingbroke; the chief business being to determine how, and in what manner, his great work of building shall be done.

1661-03-03 21:10   To my Lord’s, who comes in late and tells us how news is come to-day of Mazarin’s being dead, which is great news and of great consequence.

1661-03-03 14:40   Home, where being told that my Lord had sent for me I went, and got there to dine with my Lord, who is to go into the country tomorrow.

1661-03-03 11:30   Mr. Woodcocke preached at our church a very good sermon upon the imaginacions of the thoughts of man’s heart being only evil.

1661-03-02 18:25   Above all it was strange to see so little a boy as that was to act Cupid, which is one of the greatest parts in it.

1661-03-02 18:12   There are some good humours: among others, a good jeer to the old story of the Siege of Troy, making it to be a common country tale.

1661-03-02 18:00   To Salsbury Court, where the house as full as could be; and it seems it was a new play, “The Queen’s Maske.”

1661-03-02 14:20   I went to the Theatre, where I found so few people (which is strange, and the reason I did not know) that I went out again.

1661-03-01 22:10   Spending my thoughts how to get money to bear me out in my expense at the Coronacion, against which scaffolds setting up in every street.

1661-03-01 18:40   To my father’s and found my mother ill.

1661-03-01 17:20   I saw “The Bondman” acted; an excellent play and well done. But above all that ever I saw, Betterton do the Bond man the best.

1661-03-01 14:30   Talking about my Lord’s intentions to go into the country, but to what end we know not. We fear he is to go to sea with this fleet.
