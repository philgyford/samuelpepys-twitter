1661-07-31 17:13 I went to the Theatre, and there I saw “The Tamer Tamed” well done.

1661-07-30 17:07 Mr. Salisbury is now grown in less than two years’ time so great a limner that he is become excellent, and gets a great deal of money at it.

1661-07-30 13:05 I dined with my Lady, and there met Dr. Thomas Pepys, who I found to be a silly talking fellow, but very good-natured.

1661-07-30 11:49 By water to the Wardrobe (meeting the King upon the water going in his barge to adjourn the House).

1661-07-30 10:25 The Lords challenging their privileges not to have their houses searched which makes them deny to pass the Bill for searching for pamphlets.

1661-07-29 16:46 My cozen Charles Glassecocke, though very ill himself, is gone to the country to his brother, John Glassecocke, who is a-dying there.

1661-07-29 16:10 I told my mother how things do fall short of our expectations, which I did to make her leave off her spending, which I find she is free in.

1661-07-29 14:26 Unless my father can leave his house to Tom, he has no mind to set up the trade any where else, and so I know not what to do with him.

1661-07-29 09:04 Sir R. Slingsby and I find it will be convenient for us to have Sir R. Ford’s house added to the office if he can be got to part with it.

1661-07-28 20:30 This evening my wife gives me all my linen, which I have put up, and intend to keep it now in my own custody.

1661-07-28 17:05 My wife came back and tells me that whereas I expected Sir W. Pen’s daughter should have been a great beauty, she is a very plain girl.

1661-07-28 15:47 Come home with us Sir W. Pen, and drank with us, and then went away, and my wife after him to see his daughter that is come out of Ireland.

1661-07-27 21:04 Writing a letter to my father at Brampton, who is there all alone, and I have not heard from him since my coming from him which troubles me.

1661-07-27 17:42 With my Lady Jem. and Pall through bridge, and showed them the ships with great pleasure, and then took them to my house to show it them.

1661-07-27 15:08 To a tavern hard by, and there Mr. Townsend did give us a song or two; and without doubt he hath the best manner of singing in the world.

1661-07-27 13:42 To the Wardrobe, where my wife met me, it being my Lord of Sandwich’s birthday, and so we had many friends here, and were very merry.

1661-07-27 10:33 At Mr. Montagu’s chamber I heard a Frenchman play upon the guitar, most extreme well, though at the best methinks it is but a bawble.

1661-07-26 21:28 Having made a vow to drink no wine this week, and this day breaking of it against my will, I am troubled, but I hope God will forgive me.

1661-07-26 13:43 Mr. Moore and I read my uncle’s will, and I had his opinion on it, and still find more and more trouble like to attend it.

1661-07-25 17:13 Mr. Moore and I to the Theatre, and saw “The Jovial Crew.” It is as merry and the most innocent play that ever I saw, and well performed.

1661-07-25 13:53 To my mother’s, where I found my aunt Bell and Mrs. Ramsey, and great store of tattle there was between the old women and my mother.

1661-07-25 12:21 I met my uncle Wight, and found him so discontented about my father, for which I am much troubled, and so staid not long to talk with him.

1661-07-25 10:04 Came my box of papers from Brampton of all my uncle’s papers, which will now set me at work enough.

1661-07-24 22:00 Home and to bed after I had set down my journals ever since my going from London this journey to this house.

1661-07-24 17:47 I give it out among them that the estate left me is 200l. a year in land, besides moneys, because I would put an esteem upon myself.

1661-07-24 17:42 To the office all the afternoon, which is a great pleasure to me again, to talk with persons of quality and to be in command.

1661-07-24 16:11 I hear that my man Will hath lost his clock with my tankard, at which I am very glad.

1661-07-24 14:32 To my Lady, who do shew my wife and me the greatest favour in the world, in which I take great content.

1661-07-24 13:21 To the Wardrobe, but come too late, and so dined with the servants.

1661-07-24 06:32 My wife in bed tells me of our being robbed of our silver tankard, which vexed me for the negligence of my people to leave the door open.

1661-07-23 20:49 Troubled to hear how proud and idle Pall is grown, that I am resolved not to keep her.

1661-07-23 19:13 To my father’s, where by my desire I met my uncle Thomas, and discoursed of my uncle’s will to him, and did satisfy him as well as I could.

1661-07-23 17:04 I sat before Mrs. Palmer, the King’s mistress, and filled my eyes with her, which much pleased me.

1661-07-23 17:00 Finding myself unfit for business, I went to the Theatre, and saw “Brenoralt,” I never saw before. It seemed a good play, but ill acted.

1661-07-23 11:11 Put on my mourning. Made visits to Sir W. Pen and Batten. Then to Westminster, and at the Hall staid talking with Mrs. Michell a good while.

1661-07-22 22:24 Called at my uncle Fenner’s, my mother’s, my Lady’s, and so home, in all which I found all things as well as I could expect.

1661-07-22 21:15 So to horse again, and with much ado got to London.

1661-07-22 16:55 Mr. Looker, my Lord’s gardener, showed me the house, the chappell, and, above all, the gardens, such as I never saw in all my life.

1661-07-22 13:21 So by degrees till I come to Hatfield, where I had a very good dinner with my hostess, at my Lord of Salisbury’s Inn.

1661-07-22 08:04 The day proves cold, so that having put on no stockings but thread ones, I was fain at Bigglesworth to buy a pair of coarse woollen ones.

1661-07-22 03:57 Up by three, and going by four on my way to London.

1661-07-21 20:28 It came to some agreement that for our giving of my aunt 10l. she is to quit the house and for other matters they are to be left to the law.

1661-07-21 19:04 Came the two Trices, Mr. Greene, and Mr. Philips, and so we began to argue.

1661-07-21 12:12 At home all the morning, putting my papers in order against my going to-morrow and doing many things else to that end.

1661-07-20 22:27 Tom Trice and my father gone to Goody Gorum’s, where Jaspar Trice got before me, and there had some calm discourse, but came to no issue.

1661-07-20 21:05 Mr. Davenport, Phillips, Jaspar Trice, myself and others over against the Crown we sat and drank ale and were very merry.

1661-07-20 11:24 Sir Robert tells me the money due to us upon surrender from Piggott, 164l, will go with debts to the heir at law, which breaks my heart.

1661-07-20 10:42 Sir Robert spoke between us as well as I could desire, but could come to no issue till Tom Trice comes.

1661-07-20 10:13 Sir Robert caused us to sit down together and began discourse very fairly between us, so I drew out the Will and show it him.

1661-07-20 09:40 Up to Huntingdon this morning to Sir Robert Bernard, with whom I met Jaspar Trice.

1661-07-19 14:12 My aunt continuing in her base, hypocritical tricks which both Jane Perkin (of whom we make great use) and the maid do tell us every day of.

1661-07-18 16:32 Had advice from Mr Moore from London, by my desire, that the three witnesses of the will being all legatees, will not do the will any wrong.

1661-07-17 10:05 Agreeing with Stankes to have a care of our business. We think ourselves in nothing happy but in lighting upon him to be our bayly.

1661-07-16 15:21 Letting of the crop upon the ground.

1661-07-16 11:54 Putting things in order.

1661-07-15 22:18 With a sad heart rode home to Brampton, but made myself as cheerful as I could to my father, and so to bed.

1661-07-15 16:04 I rode to Gravely with much ado to inquire for a surrender of my uncle’s in some of the copyholders’ hands there, but I can hear of none.

1661-07-15 14:30 With Dr. John Pepys and my old uncle, I read over the will, and had their advice therein, who, as to the sufficiency thereof confirmed me.

1661-07-15 13:05 I rode to Impington where I found my old uncle sitting all alone, like a man out of the world: he can hardly see; but all things else he do.

1661-07-15 11:12 With Dr Fairbrother to the Rose tavern, and called for some wine, and there met with Mr. Turner, and sent for his wife, and were very merry.

1661-07-15 09:21 To King’s College chappell, where I found the scholars in their surplices at the service with the organs, which is a strange sight.

1661-07-15 08:02 After I was trimmed, I went to Christ College, and found my brother John at eight o’clock in bed, which vexed me.

1661-07-15 07:04 Up by three o’clock this morning, and rode to Cambridge, and was there by seven o’clock.

1661-07-14 20:21 To Hinchingbroke, which is now all in dirt, because of my Lord’s building, which will make it very magnificent.

1661-07-14 19:33 My father and I walked round Portholme and viewed all the fields, which was very pleasant.

1661-07-13 19:04 Mr. Philips comes home from London, and so we have the best counsel he could give us, but for all that we were not quiet in our minds.

1661-07-12 18:28 With the badness of the drink and the ill opinion I have of the meat, and the biting of the gnats, I am almost out of my wits with trouble.

1661-07-12 15:22 We missed the surrenders of my uncle’s copyhold land, without which the land would not come to us, but to the heir at law.

1661-07-11 09:51 We find my uncle’s papers so well sorted as I would have had them, but all in confusion, that break my brains to understand them.

1661-07-10 14:03 Above all, our trouble is to find that my uncle’s estate appears nothing as we expected, and all the world believes.

1661-07-09 12:26 We had news of Tom Trice’s putting in a caveat against us, in behalf of his mother, to whom my uncle hath not given anything.

1661-07-08 17:49 Much troubled with my aunt’s base, ugly humours.

1661-07-08 11:28 I fell to work, and my father to look over my uncle’s papers and clothes.

1661-07-07 15:03 Mr. Turner spoke not particularly of him anything, but that he was one so well known for his honesty, that it spoke for itself above all.

1661-07-07 14:52 Then to carry him to the church, where Mr. Taylor buried him, and Mr. Turner preached a funerall sermon.

1661-07-07 13:04 All people far and near come in; in the greatest disorder that ever I saw. We made shift to serve them what we had of wine and other things.

1661-07-07 11:10 We went about getting things, as ribbands and gloves, ready for the burial.

1661-07-07 09:29 Though he gives me nothing till my father’s death, yet I am glad to see that he hath done so well for us, and to the rest of his kindred.

1661-07-07 09:21 My father and I walked in the garden and read the will.

1661-07-06 22:48 My father and I lay together tonight, I greedy to see the will, but did not ask to see it till to-morrow.

1661-07-06 21:59 My aunt I found in bed in a most nasty ugly pickle, made me sick to see it.

1661-07-06 21:40 My uncle’s corps begun to smell, and so I caused it to be set forth in the yard all night, and watched by two men.

1661-07-06 21:10 My uncle’s corps in a coffin standing upon joynt-stools in the chimney in the hall.

1661-07-06 20:55 We rode and got well to Brampton, where I found my father well.

1661-07-06 11:27 To the Post House and set out, taking the messenger with me that came to me.

1661-07-06 09:52 I went and told my uncle Wight, my Lady, and some others, and bought me a pair of boots in St. Martin’s, and got myself ready.

1661-07-06 07:04 I rose sorry in some respect, glad in my expectations in another respect.

1661-07-06 06:52 Waked with news, brought me by a messenger on purpose, that my uncle Robert is dead, and died yesterday.

1661-07-05 17:20 To the office, and that being done all went to Sir W. Batten’s and there had a venison pasty, and were very merry.

1661-07-04 21:34 Mr Batersby the apothecary told me that if my uncle had the emerods and that now they are stopped, bleeding behind by leeches will cure him.

1661-07-04 18:27 Called at my father’s, and there I heard that my uncle Robert continues to have his fits of stupefaction every day for 10 or 12 hours.

1661-07-04 17:12 Strange to see this house, that used to be so thronged, now empty since the Opera begun; and so will continue for a while, I believe.

1661-07-04 17:03 I went to the Theatre, and there I saw “Claracilla” (the first time I ever saw it), well acted.

1661-07-03 20:52 To Sir W. Batten’s with the Comptroller, where we sat talking and disputing with Mr. Mills the parson of our parish.

1661-07-03 16:48 My Lady Batten and my wife were at the burial of a daughter of Sir John Lawson’s, and had rings for themselves and their husbands.

1661-07-03 15:05 Home through Duck Lane to inquire for some Spanish books, but found none that pleased me.

1661-07-03 13:57 Dined with my Lady, who is in some mourning for her brother, Mr. Saml. Crew, who died yesterday of the spotted fever.

1661-07-02 17:12 The scene indeed is very fine and magnificent, and well acted, all but the Eunuch, who was so much out that he was hissed off the stage.

1661-07-02 15:47 By the breaking of a board over our heads we had a great deal of dust fell into the ladies’ necks and the men’s hair, which made good sport.

1661-07-02 15:22 To-day was acted the second part of “The Siege of Rhodes.” We staid a very great while for the King and the Queen of Bohemia.

1661-07-02 14:36 Took coach and went to Sir William Davenant’s Opera; this being the fourth day that it hath begun, and the first that I have seen it.

1661-07-02 10:21 My father writes that my uncle is by fits stupid, and like a man that is drunk, and sometimes speechless.

1661-07-01 12:16 Among other things, a fair chest of drawers for my own chamber, and an Indian gown for myself. The first cost me 33s., the other 34s.

1661-07-01 12:14 This morning I went up and down into the city, to buy several things, as I have lately done, for my house.
