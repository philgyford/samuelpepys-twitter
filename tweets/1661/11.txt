1661-11-29 17:10 Saw “Love at first sight,” a play of Mr. Killigrew’s, but I found the play to be a poor thing, and so I perceive every body else do.

1661-11-29 15:40 The Duke of York did desire of us to know what hath been the common practice about making of forrayne ships to strike sail to us.

1661-11-29 00:53 I found our new maid Sarah come, who is a tall and a very well favoured wench, and one that I think will please us.

1661-11-29 00:24 Mr. Gawdon and I footed it all the way home, but though he was drunk he went such a pace as I did admire how he was able to go.

1661-11-28 12:08 Some letters from my Lord Sandwich, from Tangier; where he hath done some execution upon the Turks, and retaken an Englishman from them.

1661-11-27 18:48 I found that my wife had been to wait on my Lady to-day, and there danced and were very merry, and my Lady fond as she is always of my wife.

1661-11-27 11:30 I went out to Savill’s, the painter, and there sat the first time for my face with him.

1661-11-27 08:22 Our maid Dorothy and my wife parted, which though she be a wench for her tongue not to be borne with, yet I was loth to part with her.

1661-11-26 21:59 My wife and her mayde Dorothé falling out, I was troubled at it.

1661-11-26 21:15 Mr. Bence, being drunk, showed himself by his talk a bold foole, and so we were fain to put him off and get him away.

1661-11-26 21:09 After the office done, Sir Wms both and I and Captain Cock and Mr. Bence sat by ourselfs in the office, talking and drinking wine.

1661-11-26 10:45 Not well and lay long in bed.

1661-11-25 17:00 Sir W. Pen and I to the Theatre, and there saw “The Country Captain,” a dull play. I left him with his Torys and went to the Opera.

1661-11-25 12:10 I find by discourse Major General Massy to be a very ingenious man, and among other things a master in the secresys of powder and fireworks.

1661-11-25 10:04 Captain Lambert did at the Dog give me and some other friends of his, his foy, he being to set sail to-day towards the Streights.

1661-11-22 21:49 This day a good pretty maid was sent my wife by Mary Bowyer, whom my wife has hired.

1661-11-22 20:02 After all our mirth comes a reckoning of 4l, besides 40s. to the musicians, which did trouble us, but it must be paid.

1661-11-22 18:28 We had the best musique and very good songs, and were very merry and danced.

1661-11-22 13:12 To dinner at the Dolphin, where Sir W. Batten, and his lady, and Capt. Cocke and his lady, a German lady, but a very great beauty.

1661-11-21 15:49 With Mr. Moore to his chamber and there he shewed me his old Camden’s “Britannica” which I intend to buy of him and so took it away with me.

1661-11-21 13:30 Mr. Moore dined with me, and we had a good surloyne of rost beefe, the first that ever I had of my own buying since I kept house.

1661-11-20 22:48 So to bed with my mind cheery, and lay long reading Hobbs his “Liberty and Necessity,” and a little but very shrewd piece, and so to sleep.

1661-11-20 13:49 To the Wardrobe, and dined with my Lady, my Lady Wright being there too, whom I find to be a witty but very conceited woman and proud.

1661-11-20 10:38 To Westminster Hall by water, where I saw the King going in his barge to the Parliament House; this being the first day of their meeting.

1661-11-19 15:49 We at the christening of my cozens boy, where my cozen Samuel Pepys, of Ireland, and I were godfathers, and I did name the child Samuel.

1661-11-19 12:22 Remembering that there was no place else with a fire for Mr. Hunt to be in, it being also cold weather, I was at ease again.

1661-11-19 12:16 Coming home found Mr. Hunt with my wife in the chamber alone, which God forgive me did trouble my head.

1661-11-18 11:10 I putting in at St. Paul’s where I saw the quiristers in their surplices going to prayers, and a few idle poor people and boys to hear them.

1661-11-17 15:05 Heard a fellow upon the praise of Church musique and exclaiming against men’s wearing hats on in church but I slept part of the sermon.

1661-11-15 18:47 Captain Ferrers’ horses were so tired they could not be got to go up Fish Street Hill, though all the street boys and men did beat them.

1661-11-15 14:05 My wife did shew herself to my Lady in the handkercher that she bought the lace for the other day, and indeed it is very handsome.

1661-11-14 12:59 To the Sun where we had a most excellent dinner, but a pie of such pleasant variety of good things, as in all my life I never tasted.

1661-11-13 22:32 This night began to lie in the green chamber, where the maids lie, but we could not get Nell to lie there, because I lie there and my wife.

1661-11-13 17:54 Now I am coming to lay out a great deal of money in clothes for my wife, I must forbear other expenses.

1661-11-13 17:52 It raining hard I went home by coach, with my mind very heavy for this my expensefull life, which will undo me, I fear, after all my hopes.

1661-11-13 12:22 Sir Thomas tells me in good earnest that he do believe the Parliament, will be troublesome to the Court and Clergy, which God forbid!

1661-11-13 10:38 The Duke of York is in mourning for his wife’s grandmother, which is thought a great piece of fondness.

1661-11-13 10:03 To wait upon the Duke of York, which we did in his chamber, as he was dressing himself in his riding suit to go by sea to the Downs.

1661-11-12 19:33 To the Greyhound in Fleet Street, and there drank some raspberry sack and eat some sasages, and so home very merry.

1661-11-12 16:32 Though I love “Bartholomew Fayre” as much as ever I did, yet I do not like the puppets at all, but think it to be a lessening to it.

1661-11-12 14:20 My wife and I to “Bartholomew Fayre,” with puppets which I had seen once before, and the play without puppets often.

1661-11-11 17:39 God keep me so to order myself and my wife’s expenses that no inconvenience in purse or honour follow this my prodigality.

1661-11-11 17:32 I found my Lady had agreed upon a lace for my wife of 6l, which I seemed glad of that it was no more, though in my mind I think it too much.

1661-11-11 16:09 I do not in myself like to have young girls exposed to so much vanity.

1661-11-11 16:05 Captain Ferrers took me to a dancing school in Fleet Street, where we saw a company of pretty girls dance.

1661-11-11 15:14 Strange the folly of men to lose so much money, and glad I was to see a gamester’s life, which I see is miserable, and poor, and unmanly.

1661-11-11 14:58 Captain Ferrers carried me the first time that ever I saw any gaming house, to one, entering into Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields.

1661-11-11 12:32 To the Wardrobe to dinner, and by appointment met my wife, who had by my direction brought some laces for my Lady to choose one for her.

1661-11-10 22:49 We sent for two bottles of Canary, which did do me a great deal of hurt, and I came home so out of order that I was loth to say prayers.

1661-11-10 15:09 Sat with Mr. Turner in his pew at St. Gregory’s, where I hear our Queen Katherine, the first time by name as such, publickly prayed for.

1661-11-10 14:32 Last night died Archibald, my Lady’s butler and Mrs. Sarah’s brother, of a dropsy, which I am troubled at.

1661-11-10 14:00 My Lady continues upon yesterday’s discourse for me to lay out money upon my wife, which I think is best, for her honour and my own.

1661-11-09 20:04 My Lady did mightily urge me to lay out money upon my wife, which I perceived was a little more earnest than ordinary.

1661-11-08 13:52 To the Sun, where we all were to dine, and were merry, and by discourse I found Sir J. Minnes a fine gentleman and a very good scholler.

1661-11-08 09:05 To my Lord Chancellor’s with a letter to him from my Lord, and did speak with him, and he spoke to me with great respect.

1661-11-07 20:10 Letters from my Lord from Lisbone. He tells me he had seen at the court there the day before he wrote this letter, the Juego de Toro.

1661-11-07 19:32 My uncle Fenner tells that Peg Kite hath declared she will have the beggarly rogue the weaver, and so we are resolved not to meddle.

1661-11-07 09:03 Came one Mr. Hill, to teach me to play on the Theorbo, but I do not like his play nor singing, and so I found a way to put him off.

1661-11-06 19:40 I endeavoured to speak with Tom Trice (who I fear is hatching some mischief), but could not, which vexed me.

1661-11-06 12:20 To Nick Osborne’s at the Victualling Office, and saw his wife, who he has lately married, a good sober woman, and new come to their home.

1661-11-06 09:05 I met Mr. Davenport and a friend of his, to drink their morning draft with me, and I did give it them in wine, and anchovies, and oysters.

1661-11-05 23:05 Called at my Lady Batten’s again and would have gone to cards, but Sir W. Pen was so fuddled that we could not try him to play.

1661-11-05 22:40 To the Dolphin, where we drank much, seeing the boys in the streets flying their crackers, this day being kept very strictly in the City.

1661-11-05 15:27 After dinner, I having drunk a great deal of wine, I went away, seeming to go about business, to my Lady Batten’s, and there sat a while.

1661-11-05 12:05 I find Mr. Armiger inviting my wife to go to a play, and like a fool would be courting her, but he is an ass.

1661-11-04 17:42 To our thinking not so well acted here (having great expectations). But for Betterton he is called by us both the best actor in the world.

1661-11-04 17:39 To the Opera, where we saw “The Bondman,” which of old we both did so doat on, and do still.

1661-11-04 13:20 I to the Mitre (Mr. Rawlinson’s), where Mr. Pierce, the Purser, had got us a most brave chine of beef, and a dish of marrowbones.

1661-11-03 20:50 My wife and I had a good supper of a pullet hashed, which pleased me much to see my condition come to allow ourselves a dish like that.

1661-11-03 18:32 I did try to make a song in the praise of a liberall genius (as I take my own to be) to all studies and pleasures.

1661-11-03 17:49 All the day as I was at leisure I did read in Fuller’s Holy Warr, which I have of late bought.

1661-11-03 17:33 This day I stirred not out, but took physique, and it did work very well.

1661-11-02 21:32 Though it did trouble me to beat my boy Wayneman, yet I thought it necessary to do it. So to write by the post, and to bed.

1661-11-02 21:18 Upon examination, and finding Wayneman in a lie about the time and place that he bought the gunpowder, I did extremely beat him.

1661-11-02 21:14 The match did give fire to the powder, and had burnt his side and his hand that he put into his pocket to put out the fire.

1661-11-02 21:12 Hearing a noise made, I call Wayneman up, and find that it was powder that he had put in his pocket, and a match carelessly with it.

1661-11-02 21:10 My boy Wayneman, as I was in my chamber, I overheard him let off some gunpowder.

1661-11-02 15:20 I to the Wardrobe, and there dined, and had an hour or two’s talk with my Lady with great pleasure.

1661-11-02 10:30 The first time that Sir John Minnes had come hither, and he seems a good fair condition man, and one that I am glad hath the office.

1661-11-02 10:05 Sir John Minnes, our new comptroller, was fetched by Sir Wm. Pen and myself from Sir Wm. Batten’s, and led to his place in the office.

1661-11-01 22:20 At my house we were very merry till late, having sent for Sir W. Pen’s son, Mr. William Pen, lately come from Oxford.

1661-11-01 13:40 Had the maister and his fayre sister (who is very great with Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen in mirth) up to us, and looked over some medals.

1661-11-01 12:55 To the 3 Tun Tavern, at Charing Cross, and there sent for up the maister of the house’s dinner, and dined very well upon it.
