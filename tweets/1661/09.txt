1661-09-30 21:32 We are busy about the business of sending forces to Tangier, and the fleet to my Lord of Sandwich, who is at Lisbon to bring over the Queen.

1661-09-30 16:10 The French had near 100 case of pistols among them, and the Spaniards had not one gun; which is for their honour, and the others’ disgrace.

1661-09-30 15:59 There were several men slain of the French, and one or two of the Spaniards, and one Englishman by a bullet.

1661-09-30 15:46 To the French house, where I observe there is no men of a more insolent spirit where they do well, and more abject if they do miscarry.

1661-09-30 14:24 I followed the coach, and then met it at York House, where the embassador lies; and there it went in with great state.

1661-09-30 14:05 I ran after them till at last, at the Mewes, I saw the Spanish coach with fifty drawn swords to guard it, and our soldiers shouting for joy.

1661-09-30 13:20 It is strange to see how all the City did rejoice. And indeed we do naturally all love the Spanish, and hate the French.

1661-09-30 13:16 In Cheapside hear that the Spanish hath got the best of it, and killed three of the French coach-horses and several men.

1661-09-30 10:27 I saw soldiers and people running up and down the streets. To the Spanish Embassador’s and the French, and saw preparations on both sides.

1661-09-30 08:47 To Chelsy, to my Lord Privy Seal, and there got him to seal the business. I found it to be the prettiest contrived house that ever I saw.

1661-09-30 06:20 It being the day of the entrance of an Embassador from Sweden, the Embassadors of Spain and France intended to fight for the precedence!

1661-09-30 05:55 Up by moon-shine, to White Hall, to meet Mr. Moore, but he not being come as appointed, I went to the Red Lyon to drink my morning draft.

1661-09-29 22:12 To bed, without prayers: I durst not read prayers, for fear of being perceived by my servants in what case I was.

1661-09-29 20:42 At dinner and supper I drink I know not how, of my own accord, so much wine, that I was even almost foxed.

1661-09-28 17:58 Sir W. Pen and his daughter and I and my wife to the Theatre, and saw “Father’s own Son,” a very good play and the first time I ever saw it.

1661-09-27 20:32 After my wife had put up some grapes for to be sent to the King, we took coach home, where we found a hampire of millons sent to me also.

1661-09-27 16:16 We found Captain Country come with some grapes and millons from my Lord at Lisbon, the first that ever I saw any.

1661-09-26 17:27 Abroad with my wife by coach to the Theatre to shew her “King and no King,” it being very well done.

1661-09-25 17:38 Much against my will, yet such is the power of the Devil over me I could not refuse it, to the Theatre and saw “The Merry Wives of Windsor.”

1661-09-25 13:35 The Queen of England (as she is now owned and called) I hear doth keep open Court, and distinct at Lisbon.

1661-09-25 10:55 Sir R. Slingsby and I in his coach through the Mewes, which is the way that all coaches are forced to go because of a stop at Charing Cross.

1661-09-24 16:28 We got home very timely and well, and finding there all well, and letters from sea, that speak of my Lord’s being well.

1661-09-24 14:39 Drinking at Holloway at the sign of a woman with cakes in one hand and a pot of ale in the other, resembling her to the maid that served us.

1661-09-24 07:39 We set forth, but found a most sad alteration in the road by reason of last night’s rains, they being all dirty and washy, though not deep.

1661-09-24 06:07 We had two beds and so lay single, and of all the nights that ever I slept in my life I never did pass a night with more epicurism of sleep.

1661-09-23 20:49 Away to Stevenage, and staid till a showre was over, and so rode easily to Welling, where we supped well.

1661-09-23 13:58 To Baldwick; where there was a fair, and we put in and eat a mouthfull of pork, which they made us pay 14d. for, which vexed us much.

1661-09-23 10:22 I told my father and mother that I should give over care for anything unless they would spend what they have with more love and quiet.

1661-09-23 09:45 Sad to hear my father and mother wrangle as they used to do in London, of which I took notice to both.

1661-09-22 11:00 Before church time walking with my father in the garden contriving.

1661-09-21 16:05 To Hinchingbroke where Mr Barnwell shewed me the condition of the house, which is yet very backward and I fear will be dark in the cloyster.

1661-09-21 12:04 All the morning with my father, going up and down the house and garden with my father and my wife, contriving some alterations.

1661-09-20 14:34 The father paid a year and a half for his fine, and the son half a year, in all 48l., besides about 3l. fees.

1661-09-20 10:32 Going towards the Court House, met my uncle Thomas and his son Thomas, with Bradly, the rogue that had betrayed us, and one Young.

1661-09-20 09:18 Will Stankes and I set out in the morning betimes for Gravely, where to an ale-house and drank.

1661-09-19 15:15 We went back to Cambridge, and there at the Beare we had some herrings, we and my brother, and after dinner set out for Brampton.

1661-09-19 11:42 With my wife went and rode through Sturbridge but the fair was almost done.

1661-09-19 09:26 We all horsed away to Cambridge, where my father and I, having left my wife at the Beare with my brother, went to Mr. Sedgewicke.

1661-09-18 21:49 By and by in comes my father, and we supped and talked and were merry, but being weary and sleepy my wife and I to bed.

1661-09-18 18:19 To the barber’s, and then to my wife again, and remounted for Impington, where my uncle received me and my wife very kindly.

1661-09-18 15:39 We got to Cambridge, where I left my wife at my cozen Angier’s while I went to Christ’s College, and there found my brother in his chamber.

1661-09-18 12:17 My wife begun, poor wretch, to be tired, and I to be angry at it, but I was to blame; for she is a good companion as long as she is well.

1661-09-18 10:28 The way about Puckridge very bad, and my wife, in the very last dirty place of all, got a fall, but no hurt, though some dirt.

1661-09-17 22:05 The mare at one time falling my wife got a fall, but no harm; so we got to Ware, and there supped, and to bed very merry and pleasant.

1661-09-17 15:33 We took coach to the end of the town towards Kingsland, and there got upon my horse and my wife upon her pretty mare that I hired for her.

1661-09-17 07:03 Telling my wife of my journey, and she with a few words got me to hire her a horse to go along with me.

1661-09-16 21:55 Found letters from my father informing me of the Court and that I must come down and meet him at Impington which I presently resolved to do.

1661-09-16 15:53 I afterwards found that it was a rogue that did use to play such tricks to get money of people, but he got none of me.

1661-09-16 15:46 There is a fellow come from my father, and he made a story how he had lost his letter, but he was sure it was for me to go into the country.

1661-09-16 10:15 Busy at home to take in my part of our freight of Coles, which Sir G. Carteret, Sir R. Slingsby, and myself sent for, which is 10 Chaldron.

1661-09-15 16:33 To church with the corps and had service read at the grave, and back again with Pegg Kite who will be a troublesome carrion to us executors.

1661-09-15 15:48 To the buriall of my aunt Kite, where besides us and my uncle Fenner’s family, there was none of any quality, but poor rascally people.

1661-09-15 10:33 To my aunt Kite’s to help my uncle Fenner to put things in order against anon for the buriall.

1661-09-14 13:04 Comes Sir R. Slingsby and his lady and a great deal of company to take my wife and I out by barge to shew them the King’s and Duke’s yachts.

1661-09-13 20:07 My wife and I went to old George’s, and there eat as much as we would of a hot shoulder of mutton, and so to boat and home.

1661-09-13 09:43 I was sent for by my uncle Fenner to come and advise about the buriall of my aunt, the butcher, who died yesterday.

1661-09-12 22:00 By link home and called at Sir W. Batten’s, and there hear that Sir W. Pen do take our jest of the tankard very ill, which I am sorry for.

1661-09-12 12:03 I saw the King’s new pleasure-boat that is come now for the King to take pleasure in; and also two Gundaloes which are very rich and fine.

1661-09-11 21:27 My wife was with her brother to see his mistress today, and says she is young, rich, and handsome, but not likely for him to get.

1661-09-11 18:30 I went home with my mind troubled for my going thither, after my swearing to my wife that I would never go to a play without her.

1661-09-11 17:55 I, against my own mind and resolution, could not forbear to go in which did make the play seem a burthen to me and I took no pleasure in it.

1661-09-11 15:09 Dr. Williams and I walking through Lincoln’s Fields observed at the Opera a new play, “Twelfth Night” was acted there, and the King there.

1661-09-11 08:24 The cats shall be quite covered; that if but the tip of the tail hangs out the dog will take up the cat again, and dig the hole deeper.

1661-09-11 08:22 Dr. Williams did show me how a dog that he hath do kill all the cats that come thither to kill his pigeons, and do afterwards bury them.

1661-09-11 08:07 To Dr. Williams, who did carry me into his garden, where he hath abundance of grapes.

1661-09-10 21:55 I found Mary, my cozen W. Joyce’s maid, come to me to be my cook maid, and so my house is full again.

1661-09-10 21:42 Bought a link and carried it till I met one that would light me home for the link. So he light me home with his, and I did give him mine.

1661-09-10 14:32 My wife into Wood Street to buy a chest, and thence to buy other things at my uncle Fenner’s (though by reason of rain we had ill walking).

1661-09-09 22:14 I believe when Sir W. Pen do come to understand it he will be angry, he has so talked of the business himself and the letter up and down.

1661-09-09 22:08 We begun to tell Sir W. Pen the business, but he had been drinking to-day, and so is almost gone, that we could not make him understand it.

1661-09-09 19:10 Found Sir Williams both and more company gone to the Dolphin to drink the 30s. that we got the other day of Sir W. Pen about his tankard.

1661-09-09 17:32 It was my fortune to sit by a most pretty and most ingenious lady, which pleased me much.

1661-09-09 17:28 To Salisbury Court play house, where was acted the first time “‘Tis pity Shee’s a Whore,” a simple play and ill acted.

1661-09-09 12:40 I drank so much wine that I was not fit for business, and therefore I went and walked in Westminster Hall a while.

1661-09-09 11:34 To the King’s Privy Kitchen, and Mr. Sayres, the Master Cook, took us into the wine cellar where we were merry, and I drank too much wine.

1661-09-08 21:33 Upon the whole I do find myself, by what I can yet see, worth near 600l., for which God be blessed, which put me into great comfort.

1661-09-08 18:22 It always was, and I fear will ever be, my foible that after I am got behind-hand with business, I am hard to set to it again to recover it.

1661-09-08 18:10 Up to my chamber all alone, and troubled in mind to think how much of late I have addicted myself to expense and pleasure.

1661-09-08 16:24 Found our new maid Doll asleep, that she could not hear to let us in. We were fain to send the boy in at a window to open the door to us.

1661-09-07 20:54 “Bartholomew Fayre” had not been acted these forty years, it being so satyricall against Puritanism, they durst not till now.

1661-09-07 20:45 Here was “Bartholomew Fayre,” with the puppet-show, acted, but I do never a whit like it the better for the puppets, but rather the worse.

1661-09-07 16:45 To the Theatre, where we seated ourselves close by the King, and Duke of York, and Madame Palmer; I can never enough admire her beauty.

1661-09-06 22:14 I home, where my wife had been long come home, but I seemed very angry, and did not show her any countenance, neither before nor in bed.

1661-09-06 17:38 My mind being for my wife’s going abroad much troubled and unfit for business, I went to the Theatre, and saw “Elder Brother” ill acted.

1661-09-06 10:22 We found my aunt Kite not like to live as we think, and she told us that if she should die she should give all she had to her daughter.

1661-09-06 09:32 My wife holding her resolution to go, and though there could not be much hurt in it, yet my own jealousy put a hundred things into my mind.

1661-09-05 20:33 My wife and I to the fair, and I showed her the Italians dancing the ropes, and the women that do strange tumbling tricks

1661-09-05 14:20 My aunt Kite is sick ready to die and sends for my uncle and me to come to take charge of things, and to be entrusted with her daughter.

1661-09-05 12:18 My wife promised to go to some place to-morrow morning, which do trouble my mind how to know whither it was.

1661-09-05 12:15 Meeting a French footman with feathers, who was in quest of my wife, he spoke with her privately, but I could not tell what it was.

1661-09-04 13:54 To Wilkinson’s, where we sent for Mrs. Sarah and there dined and had oysters, the first I have eat this year, and were pretty good.

1661-09-04 11:04 My wife and I walked a good while in St. James’s Park to see the brave alterations.

1661-09-03 20:20 I advised my mother about her getting things ready to go into the country, and she took it ill, and we had a great deal of noise about it.

1661-09-03 17:05 We had a very fine banquet, the best I ever was at.

1661-09-03 15:45 To the Wardrobe, where my Lady’s child was christened, and named Katherine (the Queen elect’s name).

1661-09-03 12:10 Mr. Howell, our turner, sent me two things to file papers on, very handsome.

1661-09-03 11:55 Some of us Commissioners went down to Deptford to pay off some ships, but I could not go, but staid at home setting papers to rights.

1661-09-02 21:49 I sent another letter to Sir W. Pen to offer him the return of his tankard upon his leaving of 30s. at a place where it should be brought.

1661-09-02 19:44 My wife met with Mr Somerset, who did give her a bracelet of rings, which did a little trouble me, though I know there is no hurt yet in it.

1661-09-02 17:04 Mr. Pickering tells me of the vices of the Court, and how the pox is so common there, and that it is as common as eating and swearing.

1661-09-02 16:38 Mr. Pickering be a fool, yet he keeps much company, and will tell all he hears, so a man may understand what the common talk of the town is.

1661-09-02 13:08 To the Rhenish wine house where the master of the house is making a cellar with an arch in his yard, which is very convenient for him.

1661-09-01 17:48 Good God! what an age is this, and what a world is this! that a man cannot live without playing the knave and dissimulation.

1661-09-01 17:44 Captain Holmes is one that can put on two several faces, and look his enemies in the face with as much love as his friends.

1661-09-01 14:24 The tankard was stole by Sir W. Batten, and the letter, as from the thief, wrote by me, which makes very good sport.

1661-09-01 14:22 We were very merry with Sir W. Pen about the loss of his tankard, though all be but a cheat, and he do not yet understand it.

1661-09-01 06:30 Last night being very rainy [the rain] broke into my house, the gutter being stopped, and spoiled all my ceilings almost.
