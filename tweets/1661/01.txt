1661-01-31 19:20   My mother tells me my aunt is pretty well yet cannot live long. She believes my uncle would marry again were my aunt dead, which God forbid.

1661-01-31 18:50   To my father’s to see my mother, who is pretty well after her journey from Brampton.

1661-01-31 17:00   The first time that Argalus and Parthenia hath been acted: it is good though wronged by my over great expectations, as all things else are. 

1661-01-31 14:40   To the Theatre, and sat in the pit among the company of fine ladys, &c.; and the house was exceeding full, to see Argalus and Parthenia.

1661-01-31 12:10   This morning with Mr. Coventry at Whitehall about getting a ship to carry my Lord’s deals to Lynne, and we have chosen the Gift.

1661-01-30 19:20   My wife and Lady Batten are lately come back from being abroad, and seeing of Cromwell, Ireton, and Bradshaw hanged and buried at Tyburn.

1661-01-30 18:40   I had a letter from my brother John, a very ingenious one, and he therein begs to have leave to come to town at the Coronacion.

1661-01-30 17:10   I went home, and there understand that my mother is come home well from Brampton.

1661-01-30 14:50   We please ourselves to see young Davis and Whitton, two of our clerks, in the field, who we observe to take much pleasure together.

1661-01-30 14:30   Sir W. Pen and I into Moorfields and had a brave talk, it being a most pleasant day.

1661-01-30 11:20   Mr. Mills made a most excellent sermon; speaking excellently of the justice of God in punishing men for the sins of their ancestors.

1661-01-30 06:50   (Fast day). The first time that this day hath been yet observed.

1661-01-29 21:20   To Mr. Turner’s house, where we had a most neat little but costly and genteel supper.

1661-01-29 16:50   After great patience and little expectation, from so poor beginning, I saw three acts of “The Mayd in ye Mill” acted to my great content.

1661-01-29 11:10   Over the fields to Lambeth, and there drank, it being a most glorious and warm day, even to amazement, for this time of the year.

1661-01-28 17:35   I sitting in a dark place, a lady spit backward upon me by a mistake. After seeing her to be a very pretty lady, I was not troubled at it.

1661-01-28 17:20   To the Theatre, where I saw again “The Lost Lady,” which do now please me better than before.

1661-01-28 14:10   After some talk of Cromwell, Ireton and Bradshaw’s bodies being taken out of their graves to-day, I went to Mr. Crew’s.

1661-01-28 13:30   To Fleet Street, with my sword to Mr. Brigden (lately made Captain of the Auxiliaries) to be refreshed, and with him to an ale-house.

1661-01-27 22:40   After supper we fell to oysters, and Mr. Turner went and fetched some strong waters, and so being very merry we parted, and home to bed.

1661-01-27 16:20   I asked Sir W. Pen Mr. Coventry’s opinion of me, and Sir W. Batten’s of my Lord Sandwich, which do both please me.

1661-01-27 13:50   At dinner was very angry at my people’s eating a fine pudding (made me by Slater, the cook, last Thursday) without my wife’s leave.

1661-01-27 06:50   Letters come from Portsmouth. The Princess is well, and my Lord Sandwich set sail with the Queen and her yesterday from thence for France.

1661-01-26 14:20   With Lieut. Lambert we made ourselves merry by taking away his ribbans and garters, having made him to confess that he is lately married.

1661-01-26 12:00   Comes one that had formerly known me and I him, but I know not his name, to borrow 5l. of me, but I had the wit to deny him.

1661-01-25 21:40   This night comes two cages, which I bought this evening for my canary birds, which Captain Rooth this day sent me.

1661-01-25 15:10   Mr. Salisbury came to show me my Lord’s picture in little, of his doing. It is strange to what a perfection he is come in a year’s time.

1661-01-24 14:20   The first dinner I have made since I came hither. This cost me above 5l., and merry we were — only my chimney smokes.

1661-01-24 13:40   There dined with me Sir William Batten and his lady and daughter, Sir W. Pen, Mr. Fox, and Captain Cuttance.

1661-01-23 21:50   I in my chamber all the evening looking over my Osborn’s works and new Emanuel Thesaurus Patriarchae.

1661-01-23 17:15   And so home, by the way paying many little debts for wine and pictures, &c., which is my great pleasure.

1661-01-23 17:00   To my bookseller’s, and for books, and to Stevens, the silversmith, to make clean some plate against to-morrow.

1661-01-23 16:10   With Greatorex to Gresham Colledge, and saw the manner of the house, and found great company of persons of honour there.

1661-01-23 15:00   Greatorex told me that he was upon a design to go to Teneriffe to try experiments there.

1661-01-23 14:40   Without dinner, went into the City, and there meeting with Greatorex, we went and drank a pot of ale.

1661-01-22 16:50   The best way of beginning a sentence, if a man should be out and forget his last sentence, his last refuge is to begin with an Utcunque.

1661-01-22 16:35   Dr. Fuller did to four great scholars dictate in Latin, upon different subjects of their proposing, faster than they were able to write.

1661-01-22 16:20   I met with Dr. Thomas Fuller, who tells me of his last and great book that is coming out: his History of all the Families in England.

1661-01-22 14:50   After a little dinner my wife and I by coach into London, and bought some glasses.

1661-01-22 10:00   It pleased me much now to come in this condition to this place, where I was once a petitioner for my exhibition in Paul’s School.

1661-01-22 09:40   We met with the King’s Councell for Trade, upon some proposals of theirs for settling convoys for the whole English trade.

1661-01-21 22:22   This day many more of the Fifth Monarchy men were hanged.

1661-01-21 22:10   So home to supper and then to bed, having eat no dinner to-day.

1661-01-21 16:42   Ways are dusty, the flyes fly up and down, and the rose-bushes are full of leaves, such a time of the year as was never known in this world.

1661-01-21 16:30   It is strange what weather we have had all this winter; no cold at all. 

1661-01-21 12:02   We are glad of it, for it is a work that will much displease the poor seamen, and so we are glad to have no hand in it.

1661-01-21 11:50   We sat with our hats on, and did discourse about paying off the ships and do find that they do intend to undertake it without our help.

1661-01-21 10:20   Sir W. Batten, the Comptroller and I to Westminster, to the Commissioners for paying off the Army and Navy, where the Duke of Albemarle was.

1661-01-20 22:20   After prayers to write down my journall for the last five days, and so to bed.

1661-01-20 16:30   My wife and I to Church in the afternoon, and that being done we went to see my uncle and aunt Wight.

1661-01-19 19:20   From thence by link, and bought two mouse traps of Thomas Pepys, the Turner, and so went and drank a cup of ale with him.

1661-01-19 17:15   Here I was troubled to be seen by four of our office clerks, which sat in the half-crown box and I in the 1s. 6d.

1661-01-19 17:00   I went to the Theatre, where I saw “The Lost Lady,” which do not please me much.

1661-01-19 13:40   I went to the Leg in King Street and had a rabbit for myself and my Will.

1661-01-19 12:00   My Lady told me how Mr. Hetley is dead of the small-pox going to Portsmouth with my Lord.

1661-01-19 10:50   Meeting Venner and Pritchard upon a sledge, who with two more Fifth Monarchy men were hanged to-day, and the two first drawn and quartered.

1661-01-18 21:50   Took home with me from the bookseller’s Ogilby’s Æsop, which he had bound for me, and indeed I am very much pleased with the book.

1661-01-18 21:00   Mr. Hollier did advise me, both as to the stone and the decay of my memory, to avoid drinking often, which I am resolved to leave off.

1661-01-18 20:10   In comes Will Joyce to us drunk, and in a talking vapouring humour of his state, and I know not what, which did vex me cruelly.

1661-01-18 11:45   At home found all well, but the monkey loose, which did anger me. I did strike her till she was almost dead, that they might make her fast.

1661-01-18 11:00   After a morning draft I took horse and guide for London; and through some rain, and a wind in my face, I got to London at eleven o’clock.

1661-01-17 22:30   To bed, the page and I in one bed, and the two captains in another, where we had very good mirth with our most abominable lodging.

1661-01-17 20:42   Whether to make his elder son heir, which my Lady is for, and I against, but rather to make all equall.

1661-01-17 20:30   At supper my Lady and I entered into a great dispute concerning what were best for a man to do with his estate.

1661-01-17 16:50   It begun to be dark before we come to Dartford, and the horses to fayle, which was our care to prevent, for fear of my Lord’s displeasure.

1661-01-17 14:30   I rode with my Lady in the coach, and the page on the horse that I should have rid on — he desiring it.

1661-01-17 11:50   From thence on board the Newcastle, to show my Lady the difference between a great and a small ship.

1661-01-17 11:00   I confess it was a great pleasure to myself to see the ship that I begun my good fortune in.

1661-01-17 10:20   The officers of the ship had prepared a handsome breakfast for my Lady, and while she was pledging my Lord’s health they give her five guns.

1661-01-17 09:50   Thence to the Charles, where my Lady took great pleasure to see all the rooms, and to hear me tell her how things are when my Lord is there.

1661-01-17 09:10   We went through Ham Creeke to the Soverayne (a goodly sight all the way to see the brave ships that lie here), which is a most noble ship.

1661-01-16 18:30   The sport was how my Lady had intended to keep herself unknown, and how the Captain of the Charles had forsoothed her, though he knew her.

1661-01-16 18:00   I found my Lady and her daughter Jem, and Mrs. Browne, all at a great loss, not finding me here, but at my coming she was overjoyed.

1661-01-16 15:00   And so over to Southwarke to the posthouse, and there took horse and guide to Dartford and thence to Rochester.

1661-01-16 13:00   By and by I did resolve to go to my Lady; and so by boat home and put on my boots.

1661-01-16 10:50   I did not know what to do, being loth to follow my Lady, and yet could not imagine what she would do when she found me not there.

1661-01-16 10:10   I to wait upon my Lady; but coming to her lodgings I find that she is gone this morning to Chatham by coach, thinking to meet me there.

1661-01-15 22:40   Comes in my boy and tells me that his mistress do lie at Mrs. Hunt’s, who is very ill, with which being something satisfied, I went to bed.

1661-01-15 22:00   My wife not yet come home, so I went up to put my papers in order, and then was much troubled my wife was not come, it being 10 o’clock.

1661-01-15 18:20   I perceive none of our officers care much for one another, but I do keep in with them all as much as I can.

1661-01-15 15:10   To Blackwall and viewed the dock and the new Wet dock, and a new merchantman which is to be launched shortly, to be called the Royal Oak.

1661-01-15 14:30   We walked into the rope-yard, where I took great notice of all the several works belonging to the making of a cable.

1661-01-15 12:00   Up and down the yard all the morning and seeing the seamen exercise, which they do already very handsomely.

1661-01-14 22:20   I with Mr. Ackworth to his house, where he has a very proper lovely woman to his wife, who both sat with me in my chamber.

1661-01-14 19:50   To Mr. Pett’s, the shipwright, and there supped, his wife a proper woman, and has been handsome, and yet has a very pretty hand.

1661-01-14 11:50   I spent much time walking with Lieutenant Lambert, walking up and down the yards, who did give me much light into things there.

1661-01-13 22:55   At last we hear that it was only five or six men that did ride through the guard in the town, without stopping to the guard.

1661-01-13 22:42   Seamen of all the ships present repair to us, and there we armed with every one a handspike, with which they were as fierce as could be.

1661-01-13 22:30   No sooner in bed, but we had an alarm, and so we rose: and the Comptroller comes into the Yard to us.

1661-01-13 15:40   With Commissioner Petter and his wife to Greenwich Church, where a good sermon, a fine church, and a great company of handsome women.

1661-01-13 11:00   We all went to church, and sat in the pew belonging to us, where a cold sermon of a young man that never had preached before.

1661-01-12 20:00   I went home with Mr. Davis, storekeeper, and was prince-like lodged, with so much respect and honour I was at a loss how to behave myself.

1661-01-12 14:10   Never till now did I see the great authority of my place, all the captains of the fleet coming cap in hand to us.

1661-01-12 11:30   To Deptford, where we fell to choosing four captains to command the guards, and choosing the places where to keep them.

1661-01-12 09:10   Major Waters, a deaf and amorous melancholy gentleman, is under a despayr in love, which makes him bad company, though a good-natured man.

1661-01-11 19:00   Walked to Paul’s Churchyard, and bespoke some books against next week.

1661-01-11 13:50   Dined at home, discontented that my wife do not go neater now she has two maids.

1661-01-11 11:35   This news do make people think something indeed, that three of the Royal Family should fall sick of the same disease, one after another.

1661-01-11 11:20   Comes news that the Princess Henrietta is fallen sick of the meazles on board the London, after the Queen and she was under sail.

1661-01-10 19:25   A thing that never was heard of, that so few men should dare and do so much mischief.

1661-01-10 19:12   All these Fanatiques that have done all this are not in all about 31. Whereas we did believe them to be at least 500.

1661-01-10 19:00   Among other things Mr. Davis told us the particular examinations of these Fanatiques that are taken.

1661-01-10 15:40   I went with my wife to see Sir W. Pen, who we found ill still, but he do make very much of it.

1661-01-10 14:10   To Mrs. Hunt where I found a Frenchman, and as I came in was kissing my wife which I did not like, though there could not be any hurt in it.

1661-01-10 10:00   We both went forth and at the Hoop by the bridge we drank two pints of wormwood and sack.

1661-01-10 09:40   There comes Mr. Hawley to me and brings me my money for the quarter of a year’s salary of my place under Downing that I was at sea.

1661-01-09 22:50   Home to my lute till late, and then to bed, there being strict guards in the City, though most of the enemies are killed or taken.

1661-01-09 14:30   I found my uncle Wight at home and his wife, and I can see they have taken my absence ill, but all things are past and we good friends.

1661-01-09 12:00   Seeing the city in this condition, the shops shut, and all things in trouble, I went home and sat, it being office day, till noon.

1661-01-09 08:05   The streets full of Train-band, and great stories, what mischief these rogues have done; I think near a dozen have been killed this morning.

1661-01-09 07:50   I found Sir R. Ford, and with him I walked up and down as far as the Exchange, and there I left him.

1661-01-09 06:35   I returned (that I might not seem to be afeared), and got my sword and pistol, which, however, I had no powder to charge.

1661-01-09 06:20   In the street I found every body in arms at the doors.

1661-01-09 06:00   Waked by people running up and down in Mr. Davis’s house, talking that the Fanatiques were up in arms in the City.

1661-01-08 21:40   Some talk to-day of a head of Fanatiques that do appear about Barnett, but I do not believe it.

1661-01-08 18:10   My Lord’s coach waited for us, and so back to my Lady’s. She made me drink of some Florence wine, and did give me two bottles for my wife. 

1661-01-08 16:30   I shewed my Lord Hinchinbroke and Mr. Sidney “The Widdow,” an indifferent good play, but wronged by the women being to seek in their parts.

1661-01-08 09:40   My wife and I lay very long in bed to-day talking and pleasing one another in discourse.

1661-01-08 00:10   We found that my people had got young Davis and some other neighbours with them to be merry, but no harm.

1661-01-07 23:20   In our way home we were in places strictly examined, more than in the worst of times, there being fears of these Fanatiques rising again.

1661-01-07 17:12   Kinaston, the boy; had the good turn to appear in three shapes: as a poor woman, then in fine clothes as a gallant, and lastly, as a man.

1661-01-07 17:00   Tom and I and my wife to the Theatre, and there saw “The Silent Woman.” The first time that ever I did see it, and it is an excellent play.

1661-01-07 07:00   My Lord Mayor and the whole City had been in arms, above 40,000.

1661-01-07 06:45   News was brought to me that there had been a stir in the City this night by the Fanatiques, who had been up and killed six or seven men.

1661-01-06 17:30   After sermon home, and there I went to my chamber and wrote a letter to send to Mr. Coventry, with a piece of plate along with it.

1661-01-06 15:10   To church again, where, before sermon, a long Psalm was set that lasted an hour, while the sexton gathered his year’s contribucion.

1661-01-06 13:50   My wife and I to church this morning, and so home to dinner to a boiled leg of mutton all alone.

1661-01-05 20:30   By coach home, staying a little in Paul’s Churchyard, to bespeak Ogilby’s Æsop’s Fables and Tully’s Officys to be bound for me.

1661-01-05 10:40   Several people came to me about business, among others the great Tom Fuller, who came to desire a kindness for a friend of his.

1661-01-04 20:40   My father told me how Will and Mary Joyce live a strange life, nothing but fighting, so that her father has a mind to have them divorced.

1661-01-04 17:20   After dinner Mr. Moore and I to the Theatre, where was “The Scornful Lady,” acted very well, it being the first play that ever he saw.

1661-01-04 08:25   I chose a gilt tankard, weighing 31 ounces and a half, and my Lord is allowed 30; so I paid 12s. for the ounce and half over.

1661-01-04 08:10   At the Jewell Office, to choose a piece of gilt plate for my Lord, in return of his offering to the King.

1661-01-03 19:20   To my father’s, where I found my mother gone by Bird, the carrier, to Brampton, upon my uncle’s desire, my aunt being in despair of life.

1661-01-03 17:10   To the Theatre, where was acted “Beggars’ Bush,” it being very well done; and here the first time that ever I saw women come upon the stage.

1661-01-03 08:00   To the Exchequer, where I told over what money I had of my Lord’s and my own there, which I found to be 970l.

1661-01-02 20:50   There stood a man at our door, when I carried the money in, and saw me, which made me a little afeard.

1661-01-02 20:20   To my Lord’s, and took my money I brought ‘thither last night and the silver candlesticks, and left the latter at Alderman Backwell’s.

1661-01-02 18:10   I took a turn in the Hall, and bought the King and Chancellor’s speeches at the dissolving the Parliament last Saturday.

1661-01-02 13:00   I found Pall (my sister) was come; but I do not let her sit down at table with me, which I do at first that she may not expect it hereafter.

1661-01-02 08:50   My Lord to White Hall stairs with much company, and I with him; where we took water for Lambeth, and there he by coach to Portsmouth.

1661-01-02 08:20   Up early, and being called up to my Lord he did give me many commands in his business.

1661-01-01 21:15   Mrs. Pierce is such a slut that I do not love her victualls.

1661-01-01 21:00   To Mr. Pierces, and there supped with them, where we had a calf’s head carboned, but it was raw, we could not eat it, and a good hen.

1661-01-01 16:50   Mr. Moore cast up the fees. One 100l. bag, after I had told it, fell all about the room, and I fear I have lost some of it.

1661-01-01 13:40   Thomas Pepys dinner a sorry, poor dinner for a man of his estate, there being nothing but ordinary meat in it.

1661-01-01 12:30   I carried my wife by coach to my cozen, Thomas Pepys, where we, with my father, Dr. Thomas, cozen Stradwick, Scott, and their wives, dined.

1661-01-01 11:00   I had for them a barrel of oysters, a dish of neat’s tongues, a dish of anchovies, wine of all sorts, and Northdown ale. We were very merry.

1661-01-01 10:45   Comes in my brother Thomas, my father, Dr. Thomas Pepys, my uncle Fenner and his two sons, to breakfast.

1661-01-01 10:30   I take myself now to be worth 300l. clear in money, and all my goods and all manner of debts paid, which are none at all.

1661-01-01 10:18   The Parliament beginning to grow factious, the King did dissolve it December 29th last, and another likely to be chosen speedily.

1661-01-01 10:05   The King settled, and loved of all. The Duke of York matched to my Lord Chancellor’s daughter, which do not please many.

1661-01-01 09:52   Myself in constant good health, and in a most handsome and thriving condition. Blessed be Almighty God for it.

1661-01-01 09:40   After much trouble with workmen I am almost settled; my family being, myself, my wife, Jane, Will. Hewer, and Wayneman, my girle’s brother.

1661-01-01 09:28   At the beginning of this year I do live in one of the houses belonging to the Navy Office, as one of the principal officers.

1661-01-01 08:00   Mr. Moore brought me my last things for me to sign for the last month, and to my great comfort tells me that my fees will come to 80l.
