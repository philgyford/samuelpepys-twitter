1661-06-30 22:04   Myself in good health, but mighty apt to take cold, so that this hot weather I am fain to wear a cloth before my belly.

1661-06-27 17:25   With my Lady Batten, Mrs. Rebecca Allen, Mrs. Thompson, &c, two coaches of us, we went and saw “Bartholomew Fayre” acted very well.

1661-06-26 16:08   We guess that my uncle Robert is very ill, and so my father do think to go to-morrow. And so God’s will be done.

1661-06-26 16:04   Found by a letter that my uncle Robert is taken with a dizziness in his head. They desire my father to come down to look after his business.

1661-06-25 22:24   Captain Allen and his daughter Rebecca and Mr. Hempson sat with me till it was late, and I had a very gallant collation for them.

1661-06-21 20:45   Much pleased at night to see my house begin to be clean after all the dirt.

1661-06-21 14:07   To dinner, where Mr. Norbury and I did discourse of his wife’s house and land at Brampton, which I find too much for me to buy.

1661-06-21 09:14   My father and I went and drank our morning draft at the Samson in Paul’s Churchyard, and eat some gammon of bacon, &c.

1661-06-20 21:43   At home the greatest part of the day to see my workmen make an end, which this night they did to my great content.

1661-06-19 22:09   I am now become the most negligent man in the world as to matters of news. Now-a-days, I neither can tell any, nor ask any of others.

1661-06-19 20:22   Thanks be to God I am very well again of my late pain, and to-morrow hope to be out of my pain of dirt and trouble in my house.

1661-06-19 11:48   All the morning almost at home, seeing my stairs finished by the painters, which pleases me well.

1661-06-16 16:52   The afternoon I spent in reading “The Spanish Gypsey,” a play not very good, though commended much.

1661-06-15 13:53   I went and dined with my Lady, who, now my Lord is gone, is come to her poor housekeeping again.

1661-06-14 16:42   I went home by coach to bed, and went not to the office at all, and by keeping myself warm, I broke wind and so came to some ease.

1661-06-14 15:18   But I could not stay with my father myself, for having got a great cold by my playing the fool in the water yesterday I was in great pain.

1661-06-14 15:14   To my father’s, and did give him order about the buying of this cloth to send to my Lord.

1661-06-13 22:14   I fell asleep till I came almost to the Tower, and there the Captain and I parted, and I home and with wine enough in my head, went to bed.

1661-06-13 21:32   Young Poole took us on board the Charity and gave us wine there, with which I had full enough, and so to our wherry again.

1661-06-13 20:12   We parted hence and went home with Mr. Falconer, who did give us cherrys and good wine.

1661-06-13 19:21   At Woolwich went on shore and so to the tavern where we drank a great deal both wine and beer.

1661-06-13 18:02   We toward London in our boat. Pulled off our stockings and bathed our legs a while in the river, which I had not done some years before.

1661-06-13 17:13   So with a sad and merry heart I left them sailing pleasantly from Erith, hoping to be in the Downs tomorrow early.

1661-06-13 16:52   My Lord did give five guns, all they had charged, which was the greatest respect my Lord could do me, and of which I was not a little proud.

1661-06-13 16:24   I took leave of W. Howe, and the rest of my friends, then took leave of my Lord, who give me his hand and parted with great respect.

1661-06-13 11:42   I went down with my Lord in the barge to Deptford, and there went on board the Dutch yacht and staid there a good while.

1661-06-13 10:21   My Lord takes barge, and was met by Sir R. Slingsby, who took his leave of my Lord, and I heard my Lord thank him for his kindness to me.

1661-06-13 07:12   I put on my gray cloth suit and faced white coat, made of one of my wife’s pettycoates, the first time I have had it on.

1661-06-12 19:13   To White Hall, where I met my Lord, who told me he must have 300l. laid out in cloth, to give in Barbary, as presents among the Turks.

1661-06-12 17:22   At home all day with my workmen, and doing several things, among others writing the letter resolved of yesterday to the Duke.

1661-06-12 09:41   To Lambeth to drink our morning draft, where at the Three Mariners, a place noted for their ale, we staid awhile very merry, and so away.

1661-06-12 07:10   A day kept between a fast and a feast, the Bishops not being ready enough to keep the fast for foul weather before fair weather came.

1661-06-11 11:23   Sir G. Carteret with us; we agreed upon a letter to the Duke of York, to tell him the sad condition of this office for want of money.

1661-06-10 22:14   We lay in Sir R. Slingsby’s lodgings in the dining room there in one green bed, my house being now in its last work of painting and whiting.

1661-06-10 13:43   I dined with my Lady; but after we were set, comes in some persons of condition, and so the children and I rose and dined by ourselves.

1661-06-10 08:41   My Lord tells me that he do intrust me with the seeing of all things done in his absence as to this great preparation.

1661-06-10 08:22   My Lord is to go to Algier to settle the business; and so to come back to Lisbone, and there to meet the fleet that is to follow him.

1661-06-09 08:41   My wife put on her black silk gown, which is now laced all over with black gimp lace, as the fashion is, in which she is very pretty.

1661-06-08 20:10   Mr. Creed and I went to the tobacco shop under Temple Bar gate, and went to the top of the house and sat drinking Lambeth ale a good while.

1661-06-08 17:35   I saw Bartholomew Faire, the first time it was acted now a-days. A most admirable play and well acted, but too much prophane and abusive.

1661-06-08 10:13   My Lord did tell me that he would have me go to Mr. Townsend, whom he had ordered to discover to me the whole mystery of the Wardrobe.

1661-06-07 22:32   After dinner to the office, and there till late at night.

1661-06-06 18:58   Here came two gentlewomen, and one could play pretty well upon the viallin, but, good God! how these ignorant people did cry her up for it!

1661-06-06 17:38   The Captain and I again to Bridewell to Mr. Holland’s, where his wife also, a plain dowdy, and his mother was.

1661-06-06 14:10   We heard musique at the Globe, and saw the simple motion that is there of a woman with a rod in her hand keeping time to the musique.

1661-06-06 12:07   My head hath aked all night, and all this morning, with my last night’s debauch.

1661-06-06 10:55   Lieutenant Lambert and I went down by water to Greenwich, in our way observing and discoursing upon the things of a ship.

1661-06-06 00:14   And so to bed, very near fuddled.

1661-06-06 00:03   Sir W. Pen came out in his shirt, and there we staid talking and singing, and drinking claret, and eating botargo and bread and butter.

1661-06-05 20:23   It being very hot weather I took my flageolette and played upon the leads in the garden.

1661-06-05 16:19   Sir W. Pen and I went home with Sir R. Slingsby to bowls in his ally, and there had good sport.

1661-06-05 09:49   I did give my wife 4l. to lay out upon lace and other things for herself.

1661-06-04 17:32   To the Theatre and saw “Harry the 4th,” a good play.

1661-06-04 13:52   Very good discourse about having of young noblemen and gentlemen to think of going to sea, as being as honourable service as the land war.

1661-06-04 10:30   The houses did not like us, and so that design at present is stopped.

1661-06-04 10:11   The Comptroller came to see a house or two near our office, then he would have me have Mr Turner’s lodgings and himself mine and Mr Davis’s.

1661-06-03 18:31   Mr. Creed and I, with much pleasure, walked quite round the Towre, which I never did before.

1661-06-03 09:44   Discoursing with my Lord, he did instruct me as to the business of the Wardrobe, in case, in his absence, Mr. Townsend should die.

1661-06-02 16:24   It rained hard, as it hath done of late so much that we begin to doubt a famine, and so Greatorex was forced to stay longer than I desired.

1661-06-02 15:05   Greatorex showed me the strength that levers have, and that what is got as to matter of strength is lost by them as to matter of time.

1661-06-02 13:30   Going home I found Greatorex come to see me, and so he and I in my chamber drinking of wine and eating of anchovies an hour or two.

1661-06-01 22:10   Having wrote letters into the country and read some things I went to bed.

1661-06-01 16:46   To Redriffe, calling at the half-way house, and come into a room where there was infinite of new cakes placed, and there we were very merry.

1661-06-01 10:34   By water to Woolwich, and there went from ship to ship to give order for and take notice of their forwardness to go forth.
