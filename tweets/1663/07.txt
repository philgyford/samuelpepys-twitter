1663-07-31 23:52   Ending the month with good content of mind, my wife in the country and myself in good esteem, and likely by pains to become considerable.

1663-07-31 16:20   With Mr. Moore to the Wardrobe, and there we reading of a merry book against the Presbyters called Cabbala, extraordinary witty.

1663-07-31 13:15   Sir W. Petty’s vessel which he hath built upon two keeles hath won a wager in sailing between Dublin and Holyhead with the pacquett-boat.

1663-07-31 12:32   Dr. Pierce tells me the injury that he thinks I do myself by being so severe in the Yards, and contracting the ill-will of the whole Navy.

1663-07-31 05:06   Up early to my accounts this month, and I find myself worth clear 730l, the most I ever had, which contents me though I encrease but little.

1663-07-30 20:14   The talk is of nothing but the foot-race run on Banstead Downes, between Lee, the Duke of Richmond’s footman, and a tyler, a famous runner.

1663-07-30 17:20   I calling for my five books of the Variorum print bound according to my common binding instead of the other which is more gaudy.

1663-07-30 14:55   After dinner into Deptford yard, but our bellies being full we could do no great business, and so parted.

1663-07-30 13:48   We dined with Sir G. Carteret at his house, a very good dinner and tempted with wines of all sorts and brave French Syder, but I drunk none.

1663-07-29 16:36   Walked to see Sir W. Pen at Deptford, reading by the way a most ridiculous play, a new one, called “The Politician Cheated.”

1663-07-29 12:55   Lord! how freely my Lady rails against Commissioner Pett, calling him rogue, and wondering that the King keeps such a fellow in the Navy.

1663-07-29 12:24   Going to Sir W. Batten (having no stomach to dine at home, it being yet hardly clean of last night’s turds) and there I dined with my Lady.

1663-07-29 06:03   Up, and found the people to have just done, and Hannah not gone to bed yet, but was making clean of the yard and kitchen.

1663-07-28 23:07   Home, where my house of office was emptying, and I find they will do it with much more cleanness than I expected.

1663-07-28 22:16   Jane cried all the time she was with me, and would not go, expecting that she might obtain something of me, but receive him I will not.

1663-07-28 20:21   Came my Jane and her brother Will to entreat for my taking of the boy again, but I will not hear her.

1663-07-27 21:32   I find by my riding a swelling to rise just by my anus. It is about the bigness of the bag of a silkworm, and makes me fearful of a rupture.

1663-07-27 21:16   To bed, weary and pleased with my journey in all respects. Only it cost me about 20s, but it was for my health, and I hope will prove so.

1663-07-27 19:30   An idle boy did show us some tumbling tricks, which he did very well, and the greatest bending of his body that ever I observed in my life.

1663-07-27 19:08   To a house hard by, where we liked well their Codlin tarts, having not time, as we intended, to stay the getting ready of a dish of pease.

1663-07-27 18:13   To the new Spring Garden, walking up and down, but things being dear and little attendance to be had we went away.

1663-07-27 16:24   For the better proceeding of justice the King did think fit to make this a Session, and to prorogue them to the 16th of March next.

1663-07-27 16:10   The King, sitting on his throne, giving them thanks for their subsidys, of which, had he not need, he would not have asked or received them.

1663-07-27 15:49   The Speaker’s speech was far from any oratory, but was as plain (though good matter) as any thing could be, and void of elocution.

1663-07-27 15:20   I came to the Lords’ House and I crowded in along with the Speaker, and got to stand close behind him, where he made his speech to the King.

1663-07-27 13:10   We set up our horses at Fox Hall, and I by water (observing the King’s barge attending his going to the House this day) home.

1663-07-27 09:23   We drank each of us three cupps, and so away and to Yowell, where we found our breakfast, the remains of our supper last night hashed.

1663-07-27 08:30   After a little study, resolved of riding to the Wells to look for our dogg, which we did, but could hear nothing.

1663-07-26 21:10   To Yowell, and set up our horses and selves for all night, employing people to look for the dogg in the town, but can hear nothing of him.

1663-07-26 18:42   We rode through Yowell beyond Nonesuch House. Our dogg fell a-running after a flock of sheep on the common, till he was out of sight.

1663-07-26 15:07   Rode through Epsum, seeing the companys that were walking; which was pleasant to see how they are there without knowing almost what to do.

1663-07-26 10:44   By Minnes’s wood, with pleasure viewing my old walks, where Mrs. Hely and I did use to walk, with whom I had the first sentiments of love.

1663-07-26 09:13   We drank each of us two pots, it being pleasant to see how everybody turns up his tail in a bush, and the women in their quarters the like.

1663-07-26 08:35   To the Wells, where great store of citizens, which was the greatest part of the company, though there were some others of better quality.

1663-07-25 22:22   To bed, a little spaniel by us, which has followed us all the way, a pretty dogg, and we believe that follows my horse.

1663-07-25 21:07   Among other meats had a brave dish of cream, the best I ever eat in my life, and with which we pleased ourselves much.

1663-07-25 19:19   I went towards Ashted. We got a lodging in a little hole we could not stand upright in, but rather than go further to look we staid there.

1663-07-25 15:34   I took the viall and played some things from one of their books, Lyra lessons, which they seemed to like well.

1663-07-25 13:58   I find Sir W. Russell’s daughter to be very well-bred, and a woman of excellent discourse, even so much as to have my attention all dinner.

1663-07-25 10:20   I find Mr. Gauden’s house finely contrived, and the gardens and offices about it as full of good variety as ever I saw in my life.

1663-07-24 15:20   We sat down again to a collacon of cheesecakes, tarts, custards, and such like, very handsome.

1663-07-24 14:32   They had a kinswoman, an ugly, red-haired slut, that plays upon the virginalls and sings, but after such a country manner I was weary of it.

1663-07-24 13:41   To Mr. Bland’s, where I was invited to dinner. I drank nothing but small beer and water. I drank so much that I wish it may not do me hurt.

1663-07-24 09:03   At Mrs. Michell’s shop sent for beer and sugar and drank, and made great cheer with it among her and Mrs. Howlett, and their daughters.

1663-07-23 22:10   To supper with Sir W. Batten upon a soused mullett, very good meat, and so home and to bed.

1663-07-23 11:49   To the yard, and there mustered the yard, and found many faults, and discharged several fellows that were absent from their business.

1663-07-23 11:10   To Woolwich, and mustered the East India ships, believing that there is cheating the King of the wages of men that do not give attendance.

1663-07-22 21:30   The Moores have made some attaques upon the outworks of Tangier; but my Lord Tiviott, with the loss of about 200 men, did beat them off.

1663-07-22 16:23   To my bookseller’s, and found my Waggoners done. The very binding cost me 14s, but they are well done, and so with a porter home with them.

1663-07-22 15:37   The reason of Harris’s going from Sir Wm. Davenant’s house, is that he grew proud and demanded 20l. for himself upon every new play.

1663-07-22 11:48   My Lady Castlemaine is now as great again as ever she was; her going away was only a fit of her own upon some slighting words of the King.

1663-07-22 10:10   To my brother Tom’s barber and had my hair cut, while his boy played on the viallin, a plain boy, but has a very good genius.

1663-07-21 21:55   This day the Parliament kept a fast for the present unseasonable weather.

1663-07-21 21:20   My head aching from last night’s bad rest, and yesterday’s distempering myself with over walking, and knocking my head against a low door.

1663-07-21 17:33   I wrote letters to my father and wife about my desire that they should observe the feast at Brampton, and have my Lady and the family.

1663-07-21 10:55   I am resolved to learn of Mr. Deane to understand a body. I find him a pretty fellow, but a little conceited, but that’s no matter to me.

1663-07-21 10:45   Comes Mr. Deane with his draught of a ship, and the bend and main lines in the body of a ship very finely, and which do please me mightily.

1663-07-21 07:20   I rose and ranted at Will and the maid, and swore I could find my heart to kick them down stairs, which the maid mumbled at mightily.

1663-07-20 21:42   Being in bed made Will read and construe three or four Latin verses in the Bible, and chide him for forgetting his grammar.

1663-07-20 14:32   I obtained an excuse from drinking of wine, and did only taste a drop of Malago Sack. It was excellent wine, like a spirit rather than wine.

1663-07-19 18:44   I fell to read over a silly play writ by a person of honour (which is, I find, as much as to say a coxcomb), called “Love a la Mode”.

1663-07-19 17:42   I read my vows and increased them by a vow against all strong drink till November of any sort, by which I shall try how I can forbear it.

1663-07-18 21:50   I walked home, all in a sweat with my tumbling of Mrs. Lane and walking, and so a little supper and to bed, fearful of having taken cold.

1663-07-18 20:26   …I felt as much as I would and made her feel my thing, and put the end to her breast and to her very belly. Of which I am heartily ashamed.

1663-07-18 20:24   I had my full liberty of towzing Mrs. Lane and doing what I would but the last thing of all…

1663-07-18 20:21   I posted and met at Mrs. Lane at the Crown in the Palace Yard, where we eat a chicken I sent for, and drank, and were mighty merry.

1663-07-18 19:34   Only their daughter was in the shop, and I took occasion to buy a pair of gloves to talk to her, and she will prove a mighty handsome wench.

1663-07-18 19:30   I expected some bands made me by Mrs. Lane, and while she went to the starchers I staid at Mrs. Howlett’s, who with her husband were abroad.

1663-07-18 16:07   To Thomson the instrument maker’s to bespeak a ruler for my pocket for timber, &c., which I believe he will do to my mind.

1663-07-17 19:49   Coming home I was saluted by Bagwell and his wife (the woman I have a kindness for), and they would have me into their little house.

1663-07-17 15:22   To discourse of measuring of timber. I made Sir W. Warren see that I could understand the matter, and did learn of and teach him something.

1663-07-17 10:04   I took Creed to my viall maker’s, and there I heard the famous Mr. Stefkins play well, and yet I found it as it is always, I over expected.

1663-07-16 21:52   I went to Sir W. Batten’s, where my Lady and I had some high words about emptying our house of office, where I did tell her my mind.

1663-07-16 19:22   Mr. Stacy told me many stories of my Lady Batten’s former poor condition, and how her former husband broke, and how she came to her state.

1663-07-16 16:11   Made a great contract with Sir W. Warren for 40,000 deals Swinsound, at 3l. 17s. per hundred.

1663-07-16 11:35   At Wapping to my carver’s about my Viall head. So home, and thence to my Viall maker’s in Bishopsgate Street.

1663-07-16 09:32   Down by water on several Deall ships, and stood upon a stage in one place seeing calkers sheathing of a ship.

1663-07-16 06:06   Dispatched things to my father’s, and two keggs of Sturgeon and a dozen bottles of wine to Cambridge for my cozen Roger Pepys.

1663-07-15 22:38   To supper, and then to a little viall and to bed, sporting in my fancy with the Queen.

1663-07-15 17:05   Did businesses at the Temple among my lawyers and others, thanking God I did not fall into any company to occasion spending time and money.

1663-07-15 15:49   Walking in the Hall and, God forgive me, had a mind to have got Mrs. Lane abroad, or fallen in with any woman else (in that hot humour).

1663-07-15 12:10   All the morning at the office, among other things with Cooper the Purveyor, whose dullness in his proceeding in his work I was vexed at.

1663-07-14 13:49   I made my uncle Thomas almost foxed, the poor man having but a bad head, and not used I believe nowadays to drink much wine.

1663-07-13 22:09   I home to supper and to bed, before I sleep fancying myself to sport with Mrs. Stewart with great pleasure.

1663-07-13 20:42   Mrs Stewart, with her hat cocked and a red plume, her sweet eye, little Roman nose, and excellent taille, is the greatest beauty I ever saw.

1663-07-13 20:30   All the ladies walked, talking and fiddling with their hats and feathers, and trying one another’s by one another’s heads, and laughing.

1663-07-13 19:55   My Lady Castlemaine is very handsome, but very melancholy: nor did any body speak to her, or she so much as smile or speak to any body.

1663-07-13 19:44   The King rode hand in hand with the Queen. My Lady Castlemaine rode among the rest of the ladies; but the King took no notice of her.

1663-07-13 18:59   Spying a man like Mr. Pembleton, how my blood did rise in my face, and I fell into a sweat from my old jealousy and hate.

1663-07-13 18:28   Finding many coaches at the Gate, I found upon enquiry that the Duchess is brought to bed of a boy.

1663-07-13 18:15   I met the Queen-Mother walking in the Pell Mell, led by my Lord St. Alban’s.

1663-07-13 15:04   Becky Allen is married to a fellow that proves to be a coxcomb and are in a way of living above their condition that will ruin them.

1663-07-13 04:20   I spent the whole night in visiting all the ships. I found neither an officer, nor any men so much as awake, which I was grieved to find.

1663-07-12 23:52   To the London, where neither officers nor any body awake; I boarded her, and might have done what I would, and could find but three boys.

1663-07-12 23:25   To the Soveraign, where I found no officers aboard, no arms fixed, nor any powder to prime their few guns, which were charged.

1663-07-12 23:04   I walked to the Dock, and got a boat and a crew, and rowed down to the guard-ships, it being a most pleasant moonshine evening.

1663-07-12 16:22   I dissatisfied with Commissioner Pett, convinced he is not able to exercise the command in the Yard over the officers that he ought to do.

1663-07-12 11:06   I saw Mrs. Becky Allen, who hath been married, and is churched, after her bearing a child. She is grown tall, but looks very white and thin.

1663-07-12 06:06   I did give Tom Willson my pardon, telling him only that it was well I was not a woman with child, for it might have made me miscarry.

1663-07-12 01:34   Tom Willson desired my pardon, for he thought that it had been Salmon, the Frenchman, with whom he intended to have made some sport.

1663-07-12 01:32   I found him to be Tom Willson, Sir W. Batten’s clerk, and fearing he might be in some melancholy fit, I was at a loss what to do or say.

1663-07-12 01:30   The curtains of my bed being drawn waked me, and I saw a man stand there calling me French dogg 20 times, one after another.

1663-07-11 14:56   To St. Mary Creek where Commissioner Pett (doubtful of the growing greatness of Portsmouth), do design a wett dock at no great charge.

1663-07-10 09:02   Pierce the chirurgeon tells me that the King is grown colder to my Lady Castlemaine, and that he believes he begins to love the Queen.

1663-07-09 22:42   To bed, having taken great cold in my feet by walking in the dirt this day in thin shoes or some other way, so that I begun to be in pain.

1663-07-09 16:52   Bagwell and his wife did meet me to thank me for my old kindness, but I spoke little to her, but shall give occasion for her coming to me.

1663-07-09 16:33   To Deptford and mustered the Yard to find out Bagwell, a carpenter, whose wife is a pretty woman, that I might have occasion of knowing him.

1663-07-09 09:21   I went into a little alehouse. I kissed the maid of the house, who is a pretty girl, but modest, and, God forgive me, had a mind to more.

1663-07-09 04:48   Up. Making water this morning with greater freedom than I used to do, which I think I may impute to last night’s drinking of elder spirits.

1663-07-08 21:31   Mrs Turner did bring us an umble pie hot out of her oven, extraordinary good, and spirits of her making, in which she has great judgment.

1663-07-08 19:38   I received a letter from my wife, who writes so coldly that I am troubled at it. I fear shall have much ado to bring her to her good temper.

1663-07-08 13:34   Home to dinner alone upon a good dish of eeles, given me by Michell, the Bewpers’ man, and then to my viall a little.

1663-07-08 07:24   I know not what will become of the corn this year, we having had but two fair days these many months.

1663-07-07 23:43   I called late for some victuals, and so to bed, leaving the men below in the cellar emptying the vats up through Mr. Turner’s own house.

1663-07-07 17:18   I am troubled for the rogue, though he do not deserve it.

1663-07-07 17:16   I said nothing to my boy, but caused him to be stripped (for he was run away with his best suit), and putting on his other I sent him going.

1663-07-07 17:05   I spied my boy upon Tower Hill playing with the rest of the boys; so I sent W. Griffin to take him.

1663-07-07 15:49   I should be glad to see the King’s stores and service looked to as they ought, but I shall never understand the tricks the King suffers by.

1663-07-07 13:03   In Mr. Pett’s garden I eat some (and the first cherries I have eat this year), off the tree where the King himself had been gathering some.

1663-07-07 12:14   By barge to Woolwich, in our way eating of some venison pasty, I having neither eat nor drank to-day, which fills me full of wind.

1663-07-06 23:10   I to my office at my work till dark night, and so with good content home. To supper, a little musique, and then to bed.

1663-07-05 13:42   Methinks none of the kindness between the bridegroom and bride, that was between my wife and I, but as persons that marry for convenience.

1663-07-05 12:10   I had two pair of gloves, as the rest, and walked with my Lady in the garden, she mighty kind to me, and I have the way to please her.

1663-07-05 11:04   I got a horse and rode to Walthamstow very pleasantly, only coming to make water I found a stopping, which makes me fearful of my old pain.

1663-07-05 09:20   Lady Batten had sent twice to invite me to go with them to Walthamstow to-day, Mrs. Martha being married already this morning to Mr. Castle.

1663-07-04 16:55   All these gay men are not the soldiers that must do the King’s business, it being such as these that lost the old King all he had.

1663-07-04 16:45   One broadside close to our coach we had going out of the Park, even to the nearness as to be ready to burn our hairs.

1663-07-04 16:40   The King, Duke, &c., did stand to see the horse and foot discharge their guns, to show a French Marquisse the goodness of our firemen.

1663-07-04 16:07   A goodly sight to see many horses and officers, and the King and Duke come by a-horseback, and the two Queens in the Queen-Mother’s coach.

1663-07-04 15:10   With Creed to hire a coach to carry us to Hide Park, to-day there being a general muster of the King’s Guards, horse and foot.

1663-07-04 13:29   A pretty gentleman in our company thinks that it may be the Queen hath commanded Lady Castlemaine to retire, though that is not likely.

1663-07-04 10:47   Sir G. Carteret came to me to know what the meaning of S.P.Q.R. is; which ignorance is not to be borne in a Privy Counsellor, methinks.

1663-07-04 08:59   I learnt that the English foot are highly esteemed all over the world, but the horse not so much, yet we count among ourselves the best.

1663-07-04 04:24   I to my office looking over papers and mending my manuscript by scraping out the blots and other things, which is now a very fine book.

1663-07-03 12:29   I looked upon Backwell’s design of making another alley from his shop against the Exchange door, which will quite put down the other two.

1663-07-03 11:41   I spent half an hour in Mary Overy’s Church, where are fine monuments of great antiquity, I believe, and has been a fine church.

1663-07-03 09:32   Mr. Moore tells me that my Lady Castlemaine is fallen from Court, and retired. He gives me no account of the reason, but that it is so.

1663-07-02 20:11   My mind troubled me with the thoughts of the difference between my wife and my father in the country.

1663-07-02 12:42   Met with several people, among others Captain Cox, and with him to a Coffee House, and drank with him and other merchants. Good discourse.

1663-07-01 19:23   I found Dr John come to town, well again after his sickness; but, Lord! what a simple man he is, and talks so sillily to his brother Dr Tom.

1663-07-01 16:04   A letter from my wife wherein I find a sad falling out between my wife and my father and sister and Ashwell.

1663-07-01 13:32   They say that buggery is now as common among our gallants as in Italy, and the pages of the town begin to complain of their masters for it.

1663-07-01 12:48   My Lord Chief Justice saying it was for such wicked wretches as Sir C. Sydly that God’s anger hung over us, calling him sirrah many times.

1663-07-01 12:46   That being done he took a glass of wine and washed his prick in it and then drank it off, and then took another and drank the King’s health.

1663-07-01 12:44   Sir C. Sydly coming into the Balcone showed his nakedness, acting all the postures of lust that could be imagined, and abusing of scripture.

1663-07-01 12:42   Mr. Batten telling us of a late triall of Sir Charles Sydly, before my Lord Chief Justice Foster, for his debauchery at Oxford Kate’s.

1663-07-01 03:27   It rained so hard that it wakened Creed, who lay with me, and me, and so we up and fell to discourse of the business of his accounts.
