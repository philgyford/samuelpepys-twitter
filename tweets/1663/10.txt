1663-10-31 23:06 Everything lessens, which I have and am like to have. I must look to get more than just my salary, or else I may live well and die a beggar.

1663-10-31 22:33 …a new hat, and silk tops for my legs, and many other things, being resolved henceforward to go like myself. And also two perriwiggs.

1663-10-31 22:32 I having made myself a velvet cloake, two new cloth suits, black, plain both; a new shagg gowne, trimmed with gold buttons and twist…

1663-10-31 22:30 To my great sorrow I find myself 43l. worse than I was the last month, which was then 760l, and now it is but 717l.

1663-10-31 14:10 I took Creed’s opinion as to some things of clothes, which I purpose to wear, being resolved to go a little handsomer than I have hitherto.

1663-10-31 13:48 Creed and I upstairs, and I showed him my velvet cloake and other things of clothes, that I have lately bought, which he likes very well.

1663-10-30 21:10 My mind heavy thinking of my great layings out lately. But I perceive how I have hitherto suffered for lack of going as becomes my place.

1663-10-30 15:28 To the New Exchange, and then calling at my periwigg-makers, and there showed my wife the periwigg made for me, and she likes it very well.

1663-10-29 20:20 Jane has spoken to her mistress that she sees she cannot please us and will look out to provide herself elsewhere, which do trouble us.

1663-10-29 17:40 Greatorex showed me the manner of his draining of fenns, which I desired much to know, but it did not appear very satisfactory to me.

1663-10-29 14:58 The dinner is made by the Mayor and two Sheriffs, the Mayor paying one half, and they the other. The whole is reckoned to come to 7 or 800l.

1663-10-29 14:42 I expected musique, but there was none but only trumpets and drums, which displeased me.

1663-10-29 14:10 It was very unpleasing that we had no napkins nor change of trenchers, and drunk out of earthen pitchers and wooden dishes.

1663-10-29 13:54 I near Proby, Baron, and Creed at the Merchant Strangers’ table; ten good dishes to a messe, with wine of all sorts, of which I drunk none.

1663-10-29 13:07 Anon comes the Lord Mayor, who went up to the lords, and then to the other tables to bid wellcome; and so all to dinner.

1663-10-29 12:48 I drinking some hypocras, which do not break my vowe, it being, to the best of my judgement, only a mixed compound drink, and not any wine.

1663-10-29 12:20 There were no tables in the Hall but the Mayor’s and the Lords of the Privy Council that had napkins or knives, which was very strange.

1663-10-29 12:14 By coach to Guild Hall, and there was admitted, and meeting with Mr. Proby, and Lieutenant-Colonel Baron, we went to see the tables.

1663-10-29 11:28 I flung all my bands on the ground, and was angry with Jane, which made the poor girle mighty sad, so that I were troubled for it.

1663-10-29 11:23 In dressing myself and wanting a band, I found all my bands that were newly made clean so ill smoothed that I crumpled them.

1663-10-29 09:24 This morning was brought my new velvet cloake, that is, lined with velvet, a good cloth the outside, the first that ever I had in my life.

1663-10-29 06:45 Up, it being my Lord Mayor’s day, Sir Anthony Bateman.

1663-10-28 17:35 At home Sympson the joyner coming he set up my press for my cloaks and other small things.

1663-10-28 14:49 Mr. Creed and I abroad, I doing errands, and with him at last to the great coffee-house, and there after some common discourse we parted.

1663-10-27 11:37 It is strange that the Queen raves and talks of little more than of her having of children, and fancys now that she hath three children.

1663-10-26 17:33 Creed and I to one or two periwigg shops, having been displeased with one that we saw, a head of greasy and old woman’s haire, at Jervas’s.

1663-10-26 11:49 Dr. Pierce tells me that the Queen is in a way to be pretty well again, but that her delirium in her head continues still.

1663-10-26 09:04 Seeing my Lord Sandwich’s footman, I went in and saw him, and received a kind salute from him, but hear that my father is very ill still.

1663-10-25 17:10 To church again, where the Scot preached, and I slept most of the afternoon.

1663-10-24 22:10 The Queen is in a good way of recovery; and Sir Francis Pridgeon hath got great honour by it, it being all imputed to his cordiall.

1663-10-24 21:24 My wife hath a pain, and we fear that it is my matter that I give her that causes it, it never coming but after my having been with her.

1663-10-24 20:44 By the Duke of York’s persuasion Harris is come to Sir W. Davenant upon his terms that he demanded, which will make him very high and proud.

1663-10-24 13:03 At the Dolphin, where merry by pleasant stories of Mr. Coventry’s and Sir J. Minnes’s, which I have put down some of in my book of tales.

1663-10-24 10:35 After much talk of a plot, something is found in the North that a party was to rise, and some persons that were to command it are found.

1663-10-23 18:04 To Mr. Rawlinson’s and saw some of my new bottles made, with my crest upon them, filled with wine, about five or six dozen.

1663-10-23 16:55 Mr. Holliard would have me take a clyster, to keep me loose. Instead of butter, he would have me use honey, or Linseed oil.

1663-10-23 16:49 Mr. Holliard tells me that there is no doubt but that all my slyme do come away in my water, and therefore no fear of the stone.

1663-10-23 16:33 Mr. Holliard tells me that Mullins is dead of his leg cut off the other day, but most basely done.

1663-10-23 12:06 I hear that the Queen slept well last night, but her fever continues upon her still. It seems she hath never a Portuguese doctor here.

1663-10-22 14:53 After dinner with my wife to her study and there read some more arithmetique, which she takes with great ease and pleasure.

1663-10-22 09:50 Hearing that the Queen grows worse again, I sent to stop the making of my velvet cloake, till I see whether she lives or dies.

1663-10-21 20:42 I begun to enter my wife in arithmetique, in order to her studying of the globes. I hope I shall bring her to understand many fine things.

1663-10-21 16:27 With my wife to the Exchange, I being in a humour of laying out money, but only in clothes, which I every day see that I suffer for want of.

1663-10-21 14:24 My belly being full of small beer, I did all alone, for health’s sake, drink half a pint of Rhenish wine at the Still-yard, mixed with beer.

1663-10-21 08:55 We did resolve of putting me into a better garb; a velvet cloake, of cloth lined with velvet and other things modish, and a perruque.

1663-10-21 08:32 Comes my brother Tom to me, though late, which do vex me to the blood, though I have spoke a hundred times; but he is very sluggish.

1663-10-20 20:22 The King hath not missed one night since the Queen was sick, of supping with my Lady Castlemaine.

1663-10-20 20:15 The Queen’s sickness is the spotted fever; she was as full of the spots as a leopard which is very strange that it should be no more known.

1663-10-20 16:41 Seeing him not oppose me, I did give him another; at last found him drunk, of which I was glad, and so left him, and home.

1663-10-20 16:39 I being called, went thither, and the fellow coming out again of a shop, I did give him a good cuff or two on the chops.

1663-10-20 16:36 While I was in Kirton’s shop, a fellow came to offer kindness or force to my wife in the coach, but she refusing, he went away.

1663-10-20 13:58 A noble dinner, as this Mayor is good for nothing else. No extraordinary discourse of any thing, every man being intent upon his dinner.

1663-10-20 12:47 To dinner to my Lord Mayor’s, where was the Farmers of the Customes, my Lord Chancellor’s three sons, and other great and much company.

1663-10-19 15:34 It seems the Queen was so ill as to be shaved and pidgeons put to her feet, and to have the extreme unction given her by the priests.

1663-10-19 15:29 But that the Queen’s pulse beats fast, beating twenty to the King’s or my Lady Suffolk’s eleven; but not so strong as it was.

1663-10-19 15:27 I hear that the Queen did sleep five hours pretty well to-night, and that she waked and gargled her mouth, and to sleep again.

1663-10-19 11:26 Talk about the Turk’s proceedings, and the plague is got to Amsterdam, brought by a ship from Argier; and it is also carried to Hambrough.

1663-10-19 10:42 The famous Ned Mullins, broke his leg, which festered; and he had his leg cut off, but so ill done, that they fear he will not live with it.

1663-10-19 09:47 Sir W. Compton was of the best temper, valour, abilities of mind, integrity, birth, fine person, and diligence; and yet not forty years old.

1663-10-19 09:44 They tell me that Sir W. Compton, who it is true had been a little sickly for a week or fortnight, was dead.

1663-10-19 07:02 Waked with a very high wind, and said to my wife, “I pray God I hear not of the death of any great person, this wind is so high!”

1663-10-18 22:22 To prayers, and read very seriously my vowes, which I am fearful of forgetting by my late great expenses, but I hope in God I do not.

1663-10-18 21:44 Spent most of the evening at Sir W. Pen’s in complaisance, seeing him though he deserves no respect from me.

1663-10-18 11:57 The parson, Mr. Mills, did not know whether to pray for the Queen or no, and so said nothing about her; which makes me fear she is dead.

1663-10-18 11:18 I grew less concerned when, anon, my wife showed me Pembleton’s wife, a pretty little woman, and well dressed, with a jewel at her breast.

1663-10-18 11:15 I was troubled to see Pembleton at church, but I thought it prudence to take notice myself first of it and show my wife him.

1663-10-18 11:03 My wife in her best gown and new poynt that I bought her the other day, to church with me, and her mayde Jane with her.

1663-10-18 08:27 Troubled at a distaste my wife took at a small thing that Jane did, and to see that she should be so vexed that I took part with Jane.

1663-10-17 22:15 So home to supper, my house being got mighty clean to my content from top to toe, and so to bed, myself in good condition of health also.

1663-10-17 13:26 We had discourse of the Queen’s being very sick, if not dead, the Duke and Duchess of York being sent for betimes to come to her.

1663-10-17 11:47 Up and to my office, and there we sat a very full board all the morning upon some accounts of Mr. Gauden’s.

1663-10-16 17:48 I went to the Tangier Committee, where very good discourse concerning the Articles of peace to be continued with Guyland.

1663-10-16 14:34 Up to remove my chest and clothes up stairs to my new wardrobe, that I may have all my things above where I lie.

1663-10-15 06:32 Going to enjoy my wife this morning, I had a great pain in the end of my yard when my yard was stiff, as if I strained some nerve or vein.

1663-10-15 05:03 Up, I bless God being now in pretty good condition, but cannot come to make natural stools yet.

1663-10-14 21:32 With Sir W Pen, speaking against Sir W Batten and Sir J Minnes, but no more than the folly of one and the knavery of the other do deserve.

1663-10-14 15:22 Lord! to see the laughing, sporting, and no attention, but confusion in their service, more like brutes than people knowing the true God.

1663-10-14 15:07 In the end they had a prayer for the King, which they pronounced his name in Portugall; but the prayer, like the rest, in Hebrew.

1663-10-14 14:42 Their Laws that they take out of the press are carried by several men, four or five several burthens in all, and they relieve one another.

1663-10-14 14:30 At the putting on their vayles they do say something, to which others that hear him do cry Amen, and the party do kiss his vayle.

1663-10-14 14:20 To the Jewish Synagogue: where the men and boys in their vayles, and the women behind a lattice out of sight.

1663-10-14 10:07 Sir J. Minnes reading the Anatomy of the body to me, but so sillily as to the making of me understand any thing that I was weary of him.

1663-10-13 22:06 To supper and to bed, being mightily pleased with all my house and my red chamber, where my wife and I intend constantly to lie.

1663-10-13 20:32 My Lady Castlemaine, I hear, is in as great favour as ever, and the King supped with her the very first night he came from Bath.

1663-10-13 19:49 Home, with some ease and pleasure that I hope to be able to follow my business again, which I am resolved to return to with more eagerness.

1663-10-13 14:15 John Cole, my old friend, came to see and speak with me about a friend. I find him ingenious, but more and more discern his city pedantry.

1663-10-13 05:30 I had about two stools in the night – and pissed well. Voided some wind.

1663-10-12 21:25 The clyster began with my walking to work, and gave me three or four most excellent stools and carried away wind.

1663-10-12 21:07 My wife did give me a clyster which Mr. Hollyard directed, a pint of ale, 4 oz of sugar, and 2 oz of butter. I lay upon the bed an hour.

1663-10-12 16:47 When I went to try to shit, the little straining which I thought was no strain at all did by and by bring me some pain for a good while.

1663-10-12 11:30 Whether it be the jogging, or by having my mind more employed I know not, but I do now piss with much less pain.

1663-10-12 10:05 The Duke wished we all had made more profit than he had of our places, and that we had got as much as one man below stayres in the Court.

1663-10-12 08:15 Being forced to go to the Duke at St. James’s, I took coach and in my way called upon Mr. Hollyard and had his advice to take a glyster.

1663-10-11 22:03 After supper to bed as I use to be, in pain, without breaking wind and shitting.

1663-10-11 20:15 Altering chairs in my chamber and set them above in the red room, and so put their green covers upon those that were above, not so handsome.

1663-10-11 18:25 The greatest of my pain I find to come by my straining to get something out backwards, which strains my yard and cods.

1663-10-11 18:20 I finding myself neither to fart nor go to stool after one stool in the morning, the effect of my electuary last night.

1663-10-11 08:57 My wife forebore to make herself clean to-day, but continued in a sluttish condition till to-morrow.

1663-10-10 22:15 Mr. Hollyard sends me an electuary to take (a walnut quantity of it) going to bed, which I did.

1663-10-10 12:58 Dined at home, my wife and house in the dirtiest pickle that ever she and it was in, but in order, I hope, this night to be very clean.

1663-10-10 11:34 I had a couple of stools forced after the juniper water, and did break a fart or two, but whether I shall grow better upon it I cannot tell.

1663-10-10 08:01 Sir J. Minnes and Sir W. Batten did advise me to take some juniper water, and Sir W. Batten sent for some, strong water made of juniper.

1663-10-09 17:12 I did drink one of the bottles, but it was a most loathsome draught, and had a stool or two, but in no plenty, nor any wind almost.

1663-10-09 15:44 My wife’s closet indeed is, and will be, a very pleasant place, and is at present very pretty, and such as she will find great content in.

1663-10-09 13:30 Mr. Hollyard sent me two bottles of drink and some syrup, one bottle to take now and the other to-morrow morning.

1663-10-09 12:10 I sent word to Mr. Hollyard of my condition, that I could neither have a natural stool nor break wind, and by that means still in pain.

1663-10-09 11:22 I did keep my bed most of this morning, my body I find being still bound and little wind, and so my pain returned again, though not so bad.

1663-10-08 23:03 I took some powder that Mr. Holliard did give me in white wine, and sat late up, with my wife in my chamber till it had done working.

1663-10-08 14:24 Mr. Holliard assuring me that it is only my constitution being costive, and that, and cold from without, breeding and keeping the wind.

1663-10-08 12:07 Home to dinner, my pain coming again by breaking no wind nor having any stool.

1663-10-08 04:48 Pissed pretty well, but no more wind came as it used to do plentifully, after it once begun, nor any inclination to stool.

1663-10-07 21:38 Having a good fire in my chamber, I begun to break six or seven small and great farts; and so to bed and lay in good ease.

1663-10-07 18:32 I kept within all day in great pain, and could break no wind nor have any stool after my physic had done working.

1663-10-06 22:20 Finding myself beginning to be troubled with wind, and in pain in making water, I took a couple of pills that I had by me of Mr. Hollyard’s.

1663-10-06 10:03 Mr. Chr. Pett and Deane were summoned to give an account of some knees which Pett reported bad, that were to be served in by Sir W. Warren.

1663-10-06 04:07 My wife waked to ring the bell to call up our mayds, and I was angry that our bell did not wake them sooner, but I will get a bigger bell.

1663-10-05 21:47 I sat with Sir W. Penn, talking very largely of Sir J. Minnes’s simplicity and unsteadiness, and of Sir W. Batten’s suspicious dealings.

1663-10-05 17:58 My wife all day putting up her hangings in her closett, which she do very prettily herself with her own hand, to my great content.

1663-10-04 21:07 All the evening most pleasantly passed the time in good discourse of our fortune and family till supper.

1663-10-04 09:57 Up and to church, my house being miserably overflooded with rayne last night, which makes me almost mad.

1663-10-03 17:22 Mr. Blackburne came to know the reason of his kinsman (my Will) being observed by his friends of late to droop much.

1663-10-03 13:42 Home to dinner, and then abroad to buy a bell to hang by our chamber door to call the mayds.

1663-10-03 12:06 To the office, and there we sat full of business all the morning.

1663-10-03 05:59 Up, being well pleased with my new lodging and the convenience of having our mayds and none else about us, Will lying below.

1663-10-02 22:12 To supper and to bed, up to our red chamber, where we purpose always to lie.

1663-10-02 16:55 I received a letter from Mr. Barlow, with a Terella, which I had hoped he had sent me, but I find it is to present to my Lord Sandwich.

1663-10-02 13:06 Home to dinner with my wife, who is over head and eares in getting her house up.

1663-10-02 09:54 Mr Cutler do assure me that there is likelyhood of a war with Holland but I hope we shall be in good condition before it comes to break out.

1663-10-02 07:49 Visited Mr. Coventry as a compliment after his new coming to town, but had no great talk with him, he being full of business.

1663-10-01 22:05 This day the King and Court returned from their progress.

1663-10-01 21:55 Home to see the painter at work in my wife’s closet, and so to bed, having been merry with the painter, late, while he was doing his work.

1663-10-01 16:10 I by water to Deptford about a little business, and so back again, buying a couple of good eeles by the way.
