1663-08-31 21:57   I in good disposition of health since my drinking at home of a little wine with my beer; but no where else do I drink any wine.

1663-08-31 12:10   This noon came Jane Gentleman to serve my wife as her chamber mayde. I wish she may prove well.

1663-08-31 10:22   By the assistance of the City Marshall, we lay hold of three of the chief of the companies that were in the mutiny, and sent them to prison.

1663-08-30 16:42   Home and find all well and no sign of anybody being there, and so with great content playing and dallying with my wife.

1663-08-30 15:10   I was afeared that Pembleton might, seeing me at church, go home to my wife; so much it is out of my power to preserve myself from jealousy.

1663-08-30 15:06   To church, I alone; and there saw Pembleton come in and look up, which put me into a sweat, and seeing not my wife there, went out again.

1663-08-29 21:50   I am displeased at a letter Tom sent me, to borrow 20l, and yet gives me no account, as I have long desired, how matters stand with him.

1663-08-29 20:48   Calling at both the Exchanges, buying stockings for my wife and myself, and also at Leadenhall, where she and I bought meat for to-morrow.

1663-08-28 05:13   It being cold all night and this morning, and a very great frost they say abroad, which is much, having had no summer at all almost.

1663-08-27 21:04   I found a feacho (as he calls it) of sugar and a case of orange-flower water from Mr. Cocke, the fruits of my last year’s service to him.

1663-08-27 19:19   Mightily encouraged by every body that I meet, that I am taken notice of for a man that do the King’s business wholly and well.

1663-08-27 15:33   Down to see some good plank in the river with Sir W. Batten and back again, it being a very cold day and a cold wind.

1663-08-27 14:20   Up and made clean my closet of books, and had my chamber a third time made very clean, so that it is now in a very fine condition.

1663-08-26 22:02   So weary to bed.

1663-08-26 16:42   I home, being very glad to see my house begin to look like itself again, hoping not to be in any dirt a great while again.

1663-08-26 07:07   I went by water to White Hall, where the Court full of waggons and horses, the King and Court going this day out towards the Bath.

1663-08-25 22:22   I a little vexed to see that my wife do not retain things in her memory that belong to the house as she ought and I myself do.

1663-08-25 22:06   My joyners made an end of all; and so having paid them 40s. for their six days’ work, I am glad they have gone, for I am weary of this dirt.

1663-08-25 14:10   I found Ashwell gone, and her wages come to 50s, and my wife, by a mistake from me, did give her 20s. more; but I am glad that she is gone.

1663-08-25 13:52   With Sir W. Warren to a Coffee House, and there sat two hours talking of office business and Mr. Wood’s knavery, which I verily believe.

1663-08-25 12:07   I met a fine fellow with trumpets before him in Leadenhall-street, and upon enquiry I find that he is the clerk of the City Market.

1663-08-25 04:50   Up very early and removed the things out of my chamber into the dining room, it being to be new floored this day.

1663-08-24 21:07   To my office to brush my books, and put them and my papers in order again, and all the afternoon till late at night doing business there.

1663-08-24 13:07   I by water home, and found my closett at my office made very clean and neat to my mind mightily.

1663-08-24 10:28   There come to my Lord his prints of the river Tagus and the City of Lisbon, which he measured with his own hand.

1663-08-24 09:33   I am told of dotages of my Lord’s upon the slut at Chelsea, even in the presence of his daughter and Mrs. Ferrers, who took notice of it.

1663-08-23 20:33   No discourse with Ashwell, with whom for her unconcernment to do any thing in this time of dirt, but gadding abroad, I know not whither.

1663-08-23 16:32   Read “Iter Boreale,” a poem, made just at the King’s coming home; I never read it before, and like it well, but not so as it was cried up.

1663-08-23 11:03   Up and to church without my wife, she being all dirty, as my house is.

1663-08-22 16:15   Mr. Newburne is dead of eating cowcumbers, of which, the other day, I heard another, I think Sir Nicholas Crisp’s son.

1663-08-22 12:07   Home by water, where I find Ashwell gone abroad to her father, my wife having spoken plainly to her.

1663-08-22 10:53   And the gypsys told me that somebody should be with me this day se’nnight to borrow money of me, but I should lend him none.

1663-08-22 10:50   The gypsys told me many things common as others do, but bade me beware of a John and a Thomas, for they did seek to do me hurt.

1663-08-22 10:45   Mr. Castle and I walked to Greenwich, and in our way met some gypsys, who would needs tell me my fortune, and I suffered one of them.

1663-08-22 08:03   At the Tower gate we drank a cup of strong water, which I did out of conscience to my health, and I think is not excepted by my oaths.

1663-08-22 06:50   Up by four o’clock to go with Sir W. Batten to Woolwich and Sir J. Minnes, which we did, though not before 6 or 7 by their laying a-bed.

1663-08-21 20:49   I paid Mr Hunt 3l. for my viall. He tells me that I may, without flattery, say I have as good a Theorbo viall and viallin as is in England.

1663-08-21 18:07   A newe girl come, of Griffin’s helping to, which I think will prove a pretty girl. Her name, Susan.

1663-08-21 17:48   At home I find my girl that run away brought by a bedel of St. Bride’s Parish, and stripped her and sent her away.

1663-08-21 10:06   To my brother’s, and told him how my girl has served us which he sent me, and directed him to get the girl whipped.

1663-08-21 09:20   My Lord Teviott hath received another attaque from Guyland at Tangier with 10,000 men, and at last is come to a good peace with him.

1663-08-21 05:42   Up betimes and among my joyners, and to my office, where the joyners are also laying mouldings in the inside of my closet.

1663-08-20 20:15   The girle that was brought to me to-day for so good a one, being cleansed of lice by my wife and new clothes put on her back, she run away.

1663-08-20 12:35   I think Jinny a good likely girl, and a parish child of St. Bride’s, of honest parentage, and recommended by the churchwarden.

1663-08-20 12:32   Dined at home, and there found a little girl, which she told my wife her name was Jinny, by which name we shall call her.

1663-08-20 07:01   Having been angry with my brother John, and in the heat of my sudden passion called him Asse and coxcomb, for which I am sorry.

1663-08-19 15:08   Comes in Pembleton, which begun to make me sweat. I declared at one word against dancing any more, and bid him a short (God be with you).

1663-08-19 12:32   This morning came my joyners to new lay the floors, and begun with the dining room.

1663-08-19 11:59   I found my wife almost mad with Susan’s tricks, so as she is forced to let her go and leave the house in dirt and the clothes all wet.

1663-08-19 11:10   I met Tom Marsh, and I take him to be a coxcombe, and so did give him half a pint of wine, but drink none myself, and so got shut of him.

1663-08-19 10:04   We fell a-talking about my Lord’s folly at Chelsey. I find that he is given up to this wench, who has been reputed a common strumpett.

1663-08-19 09:08   By my drinking of small beere and not eating, I am so mightily troubled with wind, that I know not what to do almost.

1663-08-19 09:05   Took a note under Mr. Hollyard’s hand to drink wine with my beere, without which I was obliged, by my vowe, to drink none a good while.

1663-08-19 06:42   Susan beginning to have her drunken tricks, and put us in mind of her old faults and distractednesse, so that I became troubled with her.

1663-08-18 15:04   My father and I talked about our country-matters, and I find that he thinks 50l. per ann. will go near to keep them all, which I am glad of.

1663-08-17 14:32   In a huff Hannah told us she would be gone to-night if I would pay her her wages, which I was glad of. And so fetched her her wages.

1663-08-17 14:25   It being clear to me that Hannah, our present cook-mayde, not only has the gorgett, but had it on upon her necke when Susan came in.

1663-08-17 14:20   After dinner comes our old mayde Susan to look for a gorgett that she says she has lost by leaving it here.

1663-08-17 10:06   I met Mr. Moore, and he tells me with great sorrow of my lord’s being debauched he fears by this woman at Chelsey, which I am troubled at.

1663-08-17 07:40   Against my will I am fain to express a willingness to Ashwell that she should go from us, and yet I am glad of it, to ease me of the charge.

1663-08-16 22:15   Home, it being extraordinary dark, and by chance a lanthorn came by, and so we hired it to light us home.

1663-08-16 18:52   I staid a while with Sir J. Minnes, at Mrs. Turner’s, hearing his parrat talk, laugh, and crow, which it do to admiration.

1663-08-16 15:45   I do not think my wife did see Pembleton, which did a little satisfy me. But it makes me mad to see of what a jealous temper I am.

1663-08-16 15:20   To church again, and there I found Pembleton to stand in the isle against us. Which, Lord! into what a sweat did it put me!

1663-08-16 11:04   With my wife to church, and finding her desirous to go to church, I did suspect her meeting of Pembleton, but he was not there.

1663-08-15 18:06   Mr. Palmer saw by the officers’ respect to me a piece of my command, though God knows I hope I shall not be elated with that.

1663-08-15 15:43   To my instrument maker, and had my rule he made me last now so perfected, that I think in all points I have never need or desire a better.

1663-08-15 10:06   I walked to my viall, which is well nigh done, and I believe I may have it home to my mind next week.

1663-08-15 07:37   Lay pretty long in bed, being a little troubled with some pain got by wind and cold.

1663-08-14 17:41   I found my father discontented, and would have begun some of the differences between my wife and him, but I desired to hear none of them.

1663-08-14 14:14   Mrs. Harper and her cousin Jane came, and we discoursed long about her coming to my wife for a chamber mayd, and I think she will do well.

1663-08-14 08:49   It is not possible to keep Ashwell longer, my wife is so convinced, as she was in Sarah, to make her appear a Lyer in every small thing.

1663-08-13 21:37   It is impossible Ashwell could invent words so particularly, against which my wife has nothing to say but to deny, which I am sorry to see.

1663-08-13 21:20   Ashwell began to make her complaint, and I do perceive that she has received most base usage from my wife, which my wife sillily denies.

1663-08-13 15:43   We came to speak with Mrs. Harper about her kinswoman Jane Gentleman to come and live with us as a chamber mayde.

1663-08-13 13:23   My wife and I to talk again about getting of a couple of good mayds and to part with Ashwell.

1663-08-12 19:58   My wife could not forbear telling me how she had been used by them and her mayde, Ashwell, but I find it will be best not to examine it.

1663-08-12 19:33   I found my wife strange, not knowing, I believe, in what temper she could expect me to be in, but I fell to kind words, and so we were kind.

1663-08-12 18:12   By water to my brother’s, and there I hear my wife is come and gone home, and my father is come to town also, at which I wondered.

1663-08-12 08:27   A little to my office, to put down my yesterday’s journall, and so abroad to buy a bedstead and do other things.

1663-08-11 21:37   My head running upon what to do to fit things against my wife’s coming, as to buy a bedstead, because I have now no more beds than are used.

1663-08-11 19:07   On the King’s pleasure-boat, reading in a book of Receipts of making fine meats and sweetmeats, among others to make my own sweet water.

1663-08-11 17:49   I shewed Mrs. Turner Mr. Povy’s perspective and volary, and the fine things that he is building of now, which is a most neat thing.

1663-08-11 12:19   After the Queen is come back she goes to the Bath; and so to Oxford, where great entertainments are making for her.

1663-08-11 12:14   Dr. Pierce tells me that the King comes to towne this day, from Tunbridge, to stay a day or two, and then fetch the Queen from thence.

1663-08-10 20:30   I must use all the brains I have to bring my wife to any good, which I fear will be hard to do, and do much disgust me the thoughts of it.

1663-08-10 20:25   A letter from my father that says that my wife will come to town, at which I wonder that she should come without my knowing more of it.

1663-08-10 18:14   Sir J. Lenthall, in Southwarke, did apprehend about one hundred Quakers, and other such people, and hath sent them to the gaole at Kingston.

1663-08-10 17:07   My Lord Bristoll is either fled; having been sent for to the King, it is believed to be sent to the Tower, but he is gone out of the way.

1663-08-10 15:34   Now my delight is in the neatness of everything, and so cannot be pleased with anything unless it be very neat, which is a strange folly.

1663-08-10 15:10   I to Greatorex’s, and set him to work upon my ruler, to engrave an almanac and other things upon the brasses of it.

1663-08-10 05:17   Up, though not so early this summer as last, for which I am sorry, and am resolved to get up betimes before the season of rising be past.

1663-08-09 22:07   Home, and staid up a while examining Will in his Latin below, and my brother along with him in his Greeke, and so to prayers and to bed.

1663-08-09 15:34   To St. Dunstan’s Church, hard by us, and heard an excellent sermon of one Mr. Gifford, the parson there, upon “Remember Lot’s wife.”

1663-08-09 13:58   To Sir W. Batten to dinner, being invited, and being willing to hear how they left things at Portsmouth, which I found but ill enough.

1663-08-08 16:29   I shall call my brother John to task, and see what it is that he has studied since his going to the University.

1663-08-08 16:27   We began our walk, I asking many things in physiques of my brother John, to which he gives me so bad or no answer at all.

1663-08-08 12:44   I with Mr. Coventry down to the water-side, talking, wherein I see so many endeavours of doing the King service, that I do admire him.

1663-08-07 20:38   To discourse with my brother John, and I find him not so thorough a philosopher, at least in Aristotle, as I took him for.

1663-08-07 15:50   I believe Sir W. Pen would be glad I could have done less or he more.

1663-08-07 15:49   I fell to measuring of some planks that were in the yard, which the measurer himself was amused at, for I did it much more ready than he.

1663-08-07 09:45   I to my Viall, which I find done and once varnished, and it will please me very well when it is quite varnished.

1663-08-07 08:20   My measuring rule is the most useful that ever was made, and myself have the honour of being as it were the inventor of this form of it.

1663-08-07 08:18   To Brown’s for my measuring rule, which is made, and is certainly the best and the most commodious for carrying in one’s pocket.

1663-08-06 22:14   I well contented with this afternoon’s work, I thinking it convenient to keep in with the Joyces against a bad day.

1663-08-06 21:24   We to a puppet play in Lincolnes Inn Fields, where there was the story of Holofernes, and other clockwork, well done.

1663-08-06 16:03   A fiddler was sent for, and Mrs. Lurkin, a good, and merry poor woman, but very tall, did dance and show such tricks that made us all merry.

1663-08-06 14:34   The King’s Falconer speaking of the strength of hawkes, which strike a fowle to the ground with force that shall make the fowle rebound.

1663-08-06 13:21   I to my cozen Mary Joyce’s at a gossiping, where much company and good cheer.

1663-08-06 05:40   Up and angry with my maid Hannah for keeping the house no better, it being more dirty than ever it was while my whole family was together.

1663-08-05 21:07   This evening came a letter about business from Mr. Coventry, and with it a silver pen he promised me to carry inke in, which is necessary.

1663-08-05 16:35   As wanton and bucksome as Mrs. Lane is she dares not adventure upon the business, in which I very much commend and like her.

1663-08-05 16:30   To the King’s Head at Lambeth marsh, and I did so towse Mrs. Lane and handled her, but could get nothing more from her though I was near it.

1663-08-05 15:22   To Westminster hall, and there found Mrs. Lane, and by and by by agreement we met at the Parliament stairs and off to Stangate.

1663-08-05 12:04   All the morning at the office, whither Deane of Woolwich discoursed of the body of ships, which I am now going about to understand.

1663-08-04 21:30   If Ashwell goes I am resolved to have no more, but to live poorly and low again, and save money and keep my wife within bounds if I can.

1663-08-04 21:18   I fear I shall find a trouble of my wife when she comes home to get down her head again.

1663-08-04 21:15   A letter from my wife. She tells how Ashwell did give her the lie, and that my wife giving her a box on the eare, the other struck her.

1663-08-04 17:54   Nor do Palmer’s speaking in her belly take me, but it may be that is because I see her mouth when she speaks, which should not be.

1663-08-04 17:50   Palmer pretends to be able to sing both bass and treble, which she do something like, but not what I thought formerly and expected now.

1663-08-04 17:29   Thinking that Palmer is a woman of that sort that I might have lit upon a lady of pleasure (for which God forgive me), but there was none.

1663-08-04 16:49   Not finding Mrs. Lane, with whom I purposed to be merry, I went to Jervas’s and took him and his wife to their mother Palmer’s.

1663-08-04 15:27   With my brother John to his garden close by his house, where I eat some peaches and apricots; a very pretty place.

1663-08-04 08:56   We were called up about four a-clock, and being ready went and took a Gravesend boat, and to London by nine a-clock.

1663-08-03 20:10   To the Hillhouse and made ourselves ready and mounted and rode to Gravesend (my riding Coate not being to be found I fear it is stole).

1663-08-03 13:35   Mr. Pett did give us a very great dinner, too big in all conscience, so that most of it was left untouched.

1663-08-03 09:55   I caused the Timber measurer to measure some timber, where I found much fault, and we did give them admonition for the time to come.

1663-08-03 07:06   To the Ropehouses and viewed them all and made an experiment which was the stronger, English or Riga hemp, the latter proved the stronger.

1663-08-02 23:57   I sat up an hour after Mr. Coventry was gone to read my vows, it raining a wonderful hard showre for an hour. So to bed.

1663-08-02 17:44   To view St. Mary Creeke, but do not find it so proper for a wet docks as we would have it, it being uneven ground and hard in the bottom.

1663-08-02 15:52   To the parish church, and there heard a poor sermon, upon these words, “Ye are my friends, if ye do these things which I command you.”

1663-08-02 14:40   We three to private discourse and laid the matters of the yard home again to Commissioner Pett, and discoursed largely of several matters.

1663-08-02 11:10   Mr. Coventry and I to the Docke, and so on board the Mathias, where we did hear an excellent sermon upon “All is yours and you are God’s.”

1663-08-01 19:12   We pressed upon Commissioner Pett to take upon him a power to correct and suspend officers that do not their duty and other things.

1663-08-01 14:20   Being come to Chatham, we put on our boots and so walked to the yard, and walked up and down looking and inquiring into many businesses.

1663-08-01 11:03   Mr. Coventry and I by water to Gravesend (his man Lambert with us), and there eat a bit and so mounted.

1663-08-01 05:52   Up betimes and got me ready, and so to the office and put things in order for my going.
