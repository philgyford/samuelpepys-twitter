1663-01-31 19:20   Examining my wife’s letter intended to my Lady, and another to Mademoiselle; they were so false spelt that I was ashamed of them.

1663-01-30 20:06   I have a better collection in reference to the Navy, and shall have by the time I have filled my manuscript, than any of my predecessors.

1663-01-30 11:50   I to church, and Mr. Mills made a good sermon upon David’s heart smiting him for cutting off the garment of Saul.

1663-01-30 09:20   A fast for the King’s murther, and we forced to keep it more than we would have done, having forgot to take any victuals into the house.

1663-01-29 08:32   Lay chiding, and then pleased with my wife in bed and did consent to her having a new waistcoate made her for that which she lost yesterday.

1663-01-28 23:54   With Mr. Lewes, learning to understand the manner of a purser’s account, which is little understood by my fellow officers and yet necessary.

1663-01-28 17:20   To Wotton’s, the shoemaker, and there bought another pair of new boots, for the other I bought my last would not fit me.

1663-01-28 15:05   I see how time and example may alter a man; my Lord being now acquainted with all sorts of pleasures, which heretofore he never thought of.

1663-01-28 14:50   I to my Lord Sandwich’s, whom I find missing his ague fit to-day, and is pretty well, playing at dice with Ned Pickering and his page Laud.

1663-01-27 21:33   My brother hath the pain of the stone, and makes bloody water with great pain, it beginning just as mine did. I pray God help him.

1663-01-27 15:10   I am almost discouraged from coming any more to the Committee, were it not that it will bring me to some acquaintance of great men.

1663-01-27 14:47   Mr. Creed and I do find that there is nothing in the world done with true integrity, but there is design along with it.

1663-01-26 20:30   I have some ill offices done to Mr. Coventry, or else he observes that of late I have not despatched business so as I did use to do.

1663-01-26 15:04   Mr. Gauden and I to settle the business of the Tangier victualling, which I perceive none of them yet have hitherto understood but myself.

1663-01-26 09:20   Monsieur Raby tells me the King of France hath a mistress, Mademoiselle La Valiere, that he courts for his pleasure every other day.

1663-01-25 19:19   Collonel Honiwood, who was well yesterday at Canterbury, was flung by his horse in getting up, and broke his scull, and so is dead.

1663-01-25 17:38   My Lord wonders what the project should be of the Duke’s going down to Portsmouth with his Lady: it being no way to increase his popularity.

1663-01-25 15:48   Our discourse upon the rise of most men that we know, and observing them to be the results of chance, not policy, in any of them.

1663-01-25 13:28   I understand the King of France is upon consulting his divines upon the old question, what the power of the Pope is?

1663-01-24 21:49   To my office till late about business, and find that it is business that must and do every day bring me to something.

1663-01-24 15:07   Down to Redriffe, to see a ship hired for Tangier, what readiness she was in, and found her ready to sail.

1663-01-24 08:57   Lay pretty long, and by lying with my sheet upon my lip, as I have of old observed it, my upper lip was blistered in the morning.

1663-01-23 12:01   Meeting Sir W. Batten, turned back again to a coffee-house, and there drunk more till I was almost sick, and here much discourse.

1663-01-23 10:43   Coming by Temple Bar I bought “Audley’s Way to be Rich,” a serious pamphlett and some good things worth my minding.

1663-01-23 09:07   In discourse, among other things, Sir J. Cutler did make it out that the trade of England is as great as ever it was, only in more hands.

1663-01-22 17:29   I was empowered to direct Mr. Lanyon to take up vessels to the quantity of 150 tons, and fill them with bread of Mr. Gawden’s.

1663-01-22 17:08   We were very busy about getting provisions sent forthwith to Tangier, fearing that by Mr. Gawden’s neglect they might want bread.

1663-01-22 15:49   With the rest of the officers to Mr. Russell’s buriall, where a great and good company of aldermen and the livery of the Skinners’ Company.

1663-01-22 13:38   Mr. Wheatly’s daughter cannot fancy my brother because of his imperfection in speech, which I am sorry for, but there the business must die.

1663-01-21 14:22   We saw Mrs. Ackworth’s Rocke, which is one of the finest things done by a woman that ever I saw. I must have my wife to see it.

1663-01-20 16:58   To the office about business with pleasure, seeing myself observed by every body to be the only man of business of us all, but Mr. Coventry.

1663-01-19 22:12   To bed, it being my comfort that every day I understand more the pleasure of following of business and the credit that a man gets by it.

1663-01-19 15:17   There were labells pasted upon each bottle, and in the order and plenty as I never saw books in a bookseller’s shop.

1663-01-19 15:15   Mr. Povy bid me go down into his wine-cellar, where upon several shelves there stood bottles of all sorts of wine, new and old.

1663-01-19 14:12   We did call for prawns, swan, venison, after I had thought the dinner was quite done, and he did immediately produce it.

1663-01-19 13:10   Mr. Povy bidding us, in a frolique, to call for what we had a mind, and he would undertake to give it us.

1663-01-19 13:07   To Mr. Povy’s, where really he made a most excellent and large dinner, of their variety, even to admiration.

1663-01-19 12:10   I discoursed with Mr. Dixon about Mr. Wheatly’s daughter for a wife for my brother Tom.

1663-01-19 08:48   My Lord Sandwich is feverish, and hath sent for Mr. Pierce to let him blood, but not being in the way he puts it off till night.

1663-01-18 18:07   To Sir W. Pen’s (though much against my will, for I cannot bear him, but only to keep him from complaint to others that I do not see him).

1663-01-18 16:41   To my office, perfecting my vows again for the next year, which I have now done, and sworn to in the presence of Almighty God.

1663-01-17 19:20   I found my wife and her brother discoursing about Mr Ashwell’s daughter whom we are like to have for my wife’s woman. I hope it may do well.

1663-01-17 17:40   We did see “The Five Hours” entertainment, which is a fine play, though, through my being out of order, it did not seem so good as at first.

1663-01-17 05:48   Troubled about law matters, it came into my mind that of Epictetus, which did put me to a deal of ease, it being a saying of great reason.

1663-01-16 13:30   Captain Brewer, the paynter, tells me how highly the Presbyters do talk in the coffeehouses still, which I wonder at.

1663-01-16 07:07   Much troubled in mind this night in my dreams about my uncle Thomas and his son going to law with us.

1663-01-15 17:39   I vexed, having left my keys in my other pocket in my chamber, and my door is shut, so that I was forced to set my boy in at the window.

1663-01-15 16:07   We walked up and down the Yard and Wett Dock and did examine the proof of our new way of the call-books which we think will be of great use.

1663-01-15 13:21   I took Mr. Coventry to dine with me, I having a wild goose roasted, and a cold chine of beef and a barrel of oysters.

1663-01-14 21:57   To the office upon business, and numbering and examining part of my sea-manuscript with great pleasure, my wife sitting working by me.

1663-01-14 13:50   My wife tells me of another woman offered by her brother that is pretty and can sing, to which I do listen but will not appear over forward.

1663-01-14 10:08   Lay very long in bed, till with shame forced to rise, being called up by Mr. Bland about business.

1663-01-13 22:04   To supper, had a good sack posset and cold meat, and sent my guests away, both them and myself pleased with our management of this day.

1663-01-13 15:25   The women to cards in my wife’s chamber, the Dr. and Mr. Pierce in mine, because the dining-room smokes unless I keep a good charcoal fire.

1663-01-13 15:01   My dinner was noble and enough.

1663-01-13 14:55   I had for them, after oysters, a hash of rabbits, a lamb and a chine of beef. Next a dish of roasted fowl, and a tart, and fruit and cheese.

1663-01-13 13:20   I find my new table very proper, and will hold nine or ten people well, but eight with great room.

1663-01-13 12:15   I home, whither by and by comes Dr. Clerke and his lady, his sister, and a she-cozen, and Mr. Pierce and his wife, which was all my guests.

1663-01-13 06:10   My poor wife rose by five o’clock, and went to market and bought fowls and many other things for dinner, with which I was highly pleased.

1663-01-12 22:29   I appeared angry there were no more things got ready against to-morrow’s feast. In that passion sat up long and went discontented to bed.

1663-01-12 21:30   Home, and found my wife’s new gown come home, and she mightily pleased with it.

1663-01-12 20:44   To the Committee, where we attended to Sir J. Lawson’s description of Tangier and the place for the Mole, of which he brought a draught.

1663-01-12 14:33   My boy had struck down Creed’s boy in the dirt, with his new suit on, and the poor boy was in a pitifull taking and pickle.

1663-01-12 09:42   To see Sir J. Lawson, who I found the same plain man that he was, after all his success in the Straights, with which he is come loaded home.

1663-01-11 17:07   To my office all the afternoon writing orders myself to have ready against to-morrow, that I might not appear negligent to Mr. Coventry.

1663-01-10 16:28   Mr. Creed sat with me talking good discourse, as he is full of it, though a cunning knave in his heart, at least not to be too much trusted.

1663-01-09 17:49   I doubt the heartburning will not soon over. I am sorry for the tearing of so many loving letters of mine from sea and elsewhere to her.

1663-01-09 17:42   For my honour I am forced to make my wife a new Moyre gown, which troubles me to part with so much money, but it sets us to friends again.

1663-01-09 12:55   As discontented as I am, I could not forbear smiling all dinner till my wife began to speak bad words again, and then I began to be angry.

1663-01-09 09:00   I took her bundle of papers, and leapt out of the bed, and I tore them all before her face, though it went against my heart to do it.

1663-01-09 08:57   Being so in danger of being met with and read by others, I was vexed at it, and desired her and then commanded her to tear the paper.

1663-01-09 08:55   She now read it, and it was so piquant and wrote in English, and most of it true, of the retiredness of her life, and how unpleasant it was.

1663-01-09 08:52   My wife pulls out a paper, a copy of what, a pretty while since, she had wrote in a discontent to me, which I would not read, but burnt.

1663-01-09 08:12   My wife begun to speak of the necessity of keeping somebody to bear her company; her familiarity with her servants is it that spoils them.

1663-01-08 22:07   Home to supper and to bed, now resolving to set up my rest as to plays till Easter, if not Whitsuntide next, excepting plays at Court.

1663-01-08 17:15   The play, in one word, is the best, for the variety and the most excellent continuance of the plot to the very end, that ever I saw.

1663-01-08 13:55   I made my wife to get ready, though we were forced to send for a smith, to break open her trunk, her mayde being gone forth with the keys.

1663-01-08 13:40   There being the famous new play acted the first time to-day, “The Adventures of Five Hours,” at the Duke’s house, I did long to see it.

1663-01-08 07:30   I sent some wine for my father, to make his feast among his Brampton friends this Christmas, and my muff to my mother, sent as from my wife.

1663-01-07 18:21   My wife tells me she hears that by Sarah’s going to live at Sir W. Pen’s, all our affairs of my family are made known there.

1663-01-07 16:09   I searched the ships in the Wett Dock for fire and found all in good order, it being dangerous for the King that his ships lie together.

1663-01-07 14:42   I viewed old pay-books, and found that the Commanders did never heretofore receive any pay for the rigging time, but only for seatime.

1663-01-06 22:12   Blessing God for his mercy to bring me home, after much pleasure, to my house and business with health and resolution to fall to work again.

1663-01-06 22:07   I do find my mind so apt to run to its old want of pleasures, that it is high time to betake myself to my late vows, which I will to-morrow.

1663-01-06 18:17   Vexed at my wife’s neglect in leaving her scarf and night-dressings in the coach, though, I confess, she did give them to me to look after.

1663-01-06 17:07   To the Duke’s house, and there saw “Twelfth Night” acted well, though it be but a silly play, and not related at all to the name or day.

1663-01-06 10:21   Into Wood Street and bought a fine table for my dining-room; while we were buying it there was a scare-fire in an ally but they quenched it.

1663-01-05 16:47   At the Cockpitt, the Duke and Duchess did show some impertinent and unnatural dalliances, such as kissing, and leaning upon one another.

1663-01-05 11:32   I drank more than I have drunk at one time, or shall again a great while, when I come to return to my oaths, which I intend in a day or two.

1663-01-05 11:28   I took Sir W. Batten and Captain Allen into the wine cellar to my tenant (as I call him), and there drank a great deal of variety of wines.

1663-01-05 08:07   Sir J. Lawson is come home to Portsmouth from the Streights, who is now come with great renown among all men.

1663-01-04 21:55   To Mr. Hunt’s and was most prettily entertained by him and her, who are two as good people as I hardly know any, and so kind one to another.

1663-01-04 17:42   I would not be thought a lazy body by Mr. Coventry and others by being seen, as I have lately been, to walk up and down doing nothing.

1663-01-04 14:09   It being a very great trouble to me that I should have a sister of so ill a nature, that I must be forced to spend money upon a stranger.

1663-01-04 14:08   My wife did propound my having of my sister Pall at my house again to be her woman, since one we must have.

1663-01-04 13:21   Up and to church, where a lazy sermon, and so home to dinner to a good piece of powdered beef, but a little too salt.

1663-01-03 18:22   To my office all the afternoon till night, putting business in order with great content in my mind.

1663-01-02 20:08   I to see Sir W. Pen, who is fallen sick again. I staid a while talking with him, and so to my office, practising some arithmetique.

1663-01-02 15:09   Sir W. Batten was paying off tickets but so simply and arbitrarily, upon a dull pretence of doing right to the King, that I was weary of it.

1663-01-02 12:07   Lay long in bed, and so up and to the office, where all the morning alone doing something or another.

1663-01-01 17:52   We saw “The Villaine” again; and the more I see it, the more I am offended at my first undervaluing the play, it being good and pleasant.

1663-01-01 13:40   I find that there is nothing almost but bawdry at Court from top to bottom. How much of this is true, God knows, but it is common talk.

1663-01-01 13:33   Mrs. Sarah tells us how the King sups at least four times every week with my Lady Castlemaine; and often stays till the morning with her.

1663-01-01 10:40   I spent time walking among the courtiers, which I perceive I shall be able to do with confidence, being now pretty well known among them.

1663-01-01 10:05   Lay with my wife at my Lord’s lodgings, where I have been these two nights, with great pleasure talking, then I rose and to White Hall.
