1663-06-30 20:15   I find Creed a fellow of those tricks, that there is no degree of true friendship to be made with him, and therefore I must cast him off.

1663-06-30 19:22   The town is full of the overthrow lately given to the Spaniards by the Portugalls, they being advanced into the very middle of Portugall.

1663-06-30 05:53   The sun rising very bright and glorious; and yet yesterday, as it hath been these two months, was a foul day the most part of the day.

1663-06-29 21:31   I have used of late, since my wife went, to make a bad use of my fancy with whatever woman I have a mind to, which I am ashamed of.

1663-06-29 13:09   I believe they could not see my touzing Mrs. Lane, and so we broke up and I went out the back way, without being observed I think.

1663-06-29 13:03   Somebody, having seen our dalliance, called aloud in the street, “Sir! why do you kiss the gentlewoman so?” and flung a stone at the window.

1663-06-29 12:45   I did feel Mrs. Lane all over, making her believe how fair a skin she has, and indeed she has a very white thigh and leg, but monstrous fat.

1663-06-29 12:23   I with one word got Mrs. Lane to meet me at the further Rhenish wine-house, where I did give her a Lobster and do so touse her.

1663-06-29 08:45   Up and down the streets is cried the victory got by the Portugalls against the Spaniards, where 10,000 slain, 3 or 4,000 taken prisoners.

1663-06-28 17:55   I went to cast up my monthly accounts, and to my great trouble I find myself 7l. worse than I was the last month.

1663-06-28 04:32   My last night’s physic worked and did give me a good stool, and then I rose and had three or four stools.

1663-06-27 22:49   To my office, and there wrote letters to my father and wife, and so home to bed, taking three pills.

1663-06-27 14:44   To the Temple, and so to Lincoln’s Inn, and there walked up and down to see the new garden which they are making, and will be very pretty.

1663-06-27 08:04   Sir W. Warren and I from ship to ship to see deals of all sorts, whereby I have encreased my knowledge and with great pleasure.

1663-06-26 15:15   This house was built by the Blind Beggar of Bednall Green, so talked of and sang in ballads; but they say it was only some of the outhouses.

1663-06-26 14:43   The greatest quantity of strawberrys I ever saw, and a collation of great mirth, Sir J. Minnes reading a book of scolding very prettily.

1663-06-26 12:21   To Bednall Green, to Sir W. Rider’s to dinner, where a fine place, good lady mother, and their daughter, Mrs. Middleton, a fine woman.

1663-06-26 10:22   It is a sad season, that it is said there hath not been one fair day these three months, and I think it is true.

1663-06-25 14:32   My wife desires a new petticoat of the new silk striped stuff, very pretty. So I went to Paternoster Row presently, and bought her one.

1663-06-25 12:05   I received a letter from my wife, wherein she seems pleased with the country; God continue that she may have pleasure while she is there.

1663-06-25 09:10   The Portuguese did let in the Spaniard by a plot, and they did all rise and kill the whole body, near 8,000 men.

1663-06-24 20:56   Home again being very cold, and taking a very great cold, being to-day the first time in my tabby doublet this year.

1663-06-24 17:45   To Greenwich, and there walked into a pretty common garden and there played with Creed at nine pins for some drink.

1663-06-24 16:20   I find Creed a deadly cunning fellow and one that never do any thing openly, but has intrigues in all he do or says.

1663-06-24 11:32   The house, which I took to be the new tennis-court, newly built next my Lord’s lodgings, to be fallen down by the badness of the foundation.

1663-06-23 16:15   I to the office, and there had a great fray with Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes, who, like an old dotard, is led by the nose by him.

1663-06-23 13:03   Home to dinner alone, and there I found that my boy had got out of doors, and came in for his hat and band, and is gone away to his brother.

1663-06-23 11:24   To the ‘Change; and by and by comes the King and the Queen by in great state, and the streets full of people. They dine at my Lord Mayor’s.

1663-06-23 04:32   Before I went out, calling, as I have of late done, for my boy’s copybook, I found that he had not done his task; so I beat him.

1663-06-22 13:14   To an alehouse, where the maid of the house is a confident merry lass, and if modest is very pleasant to the customers that come thither.

1663-06-22 08:48   All along I find the shops evening with the sides of the houses, even in the broadest streets; which will make the City better than it was.

1663-06-22 05:20   Reading all our letters of the office that we have wrote since I came into the Navy, whereby to bring the series of matters into my memory.

1663-06-21 16:27   To church, and slept all the sermon, the Scot, to whose voice I am not to be reconciled, preaching.

1663-06-21 14:33   I went up and tried a little upon my tryangle, which I understand fully, and with a little use I believe could bring myself to do something.

1663-06-21 04:42   Up betimes, and fell to reading my Latin grammar, which I perceive I have great need of, and I am resolved to go through it.

1663-06-20 16:14   In a timber yard, measuring of timber, which I now understand thoroughly, and shall be able in a little time to do the King great service.

1663-06-19 22:07   Making Will read a part of a Latin chapter, in which I perceive in a little while he will be ready, if he spends but a little pains in it.

1663-06-19 20:48   We went to the Rhenish wine-house, where we called for a red Rhenish wine called Bleahard, a pretty wine, and not mixed, as they say.

1663-06-19 18:58   I to Wilkinson’s, where we had bespoke a dish of pease, where we eat them very merrily.

1663-06-19 17:07   When the King of France goes to his mistress, he goes with his guards with him publiquely, and his trumpets and kettle-drums with him.

1663-06-19 14:56   By water to Lambeth, expecting to have seen the Archbishop lie in state; but it seems he is not laid out yet.

1663-06-18 21:10   I called at Sir W. Batten’s, where finding some great ladies at table at supper, I retreated, though they called to me again and again.

1663-06-18 10:14   I do perceive by Mr Cutler and others that my diligence is taken notice of in the world for which I bless God and hope to continue doing so.

1663-06-18 10:06   Mr. Cutler came and sat in my closet half an hour with me, his discourse very excellent, being a wise man.

1663-06-17 15:50   I sent my cozen Edward Pepys his Lady, a piece of venison, and Madam Turner I sent for a dozen bottles of her’s, to fill with wine for her.

1663-06-17 11:00   To White Hall, and in the garden spoke to my Lord Sandwich, who is in his gold-buttoned suit, as the mode is, and looks nobly.

1663-06-17 08:57   I to my tar merchant to pay for the tar, which he refuses to sell me; but the master is come home and I believe we shall have it with peace.

1663-06-17 06:34   Up before 4 o’clock, which is the hour I intend now to rise at, and to my office a while, and with pleasure I fell to my business again.

1663-06-16 14:43   To Stacy’s, the Tar merchant, whose servant with whom I agreed for some tar do fall from our agreement, which vexes us all at the office.

1663-06-16 11:56   Up, but not so early as I intend now, and to my office, where doing business all the morning.

1663-06-15 22:10   Without supper anon to bed, sad for want of my wife, whom I love with all my heart, though of late she has given me some troubled thoughts.

1663-06-15 07:33   I seemed to make a promise to get a horse and ride after them; and so, kissing my wife often, and Ashwell once, I bid them adieu.

1663-06-15 05:23   Up betimes, and anon my wife rose and did give me her keys, and put other things in order and herself against going into the country.

1663-06-14 20:43   Sir J. Minnes brought many fine expressions of Chaucer, which he doats on mightily, and without doubt he is a very fine poet.

1663-06-14 19:22   I hope that after forgetting our differences, and being a while absent one from another, my wife and I shall come to agree as well as ever.

1663-06-14 15:35   My wife and I did even our reckonings, and had a great deal of serious talk. I did give her hints of the necessity of our saving all we can.

1663-06-13 18:10   By coach, with a mad coachman, that drove like mad, everybody through the street cursing him, being ready to run over them.

1663-06-13 17:23   We saw “The Faithfull Sheepheardesse,” a simple thing, and yet much thronged after, but only for the scenes’ sake, which is fine indeed.

1663-06-13 14:18   To the Royall Theatre, where I resolved to bid farewell, as shall appear by my oaths tomorrow against all plays till Christmas be over.

1663-06-13 09:07   I to the office and there had a difference with Sir W. Batten about Mr. Bowyer’s tarr, which I am resolved to cross.

1663-06-13 05:20   Up and betimes to Thames Street among the tarr men, to look the price of tarr.

1663-06-12 17:59   So to the Exchange, to buy things with my wife; among others, a vizard for herself.

1663-06-12 17:28   When the House began to fill my Lady Mary Cromwell put on her vizard, and kept it on all the play; which is become a fashion among ladies.

1663-06-12 17:22   To the Royall Theatre; and saw “The Committee,” a merry but indifferent play, only Lacey’s part, an Irish footman, is beyond imagination.

1663-06-11 21:15   The consideration that this is the longest day in the year is very unpleasant to me.

1663-06-11 19:27   My wife and I did jangle mightily about her cushions that she wrought with worsteds the last year, which are too little for any use.

1663-06-11 11:41   I spent the morning upon my measuring Ruler and with pleasure I have found out some things of great dispatch, more than my book teaches me.

1663-06-10 20:20   To the Half-Moon Tavern, I buying some sugar, which we drank with wine and thence to the whay-house, and drank a great deal of whay.

1663-06-10 17:17   But for the rest, in my life I never heard both men and women so ill pronounce their parts, even to my making myself sick therewith.

1663-06-10 17:15   We saw “Love in a Maze.” The play is pretty good, but the life of the play is Lacy’s part, the clown, which is most admirable.

1663-06-09 21:09   Though troubled in my mind, but showed no discontent to my wife, believing that this is the last time I shall be troubled with Pembleton.

1663-06-09 20:48   Lord! how I listened and laid my ear to the door, and how I was troubled when I heard them stand still and not dance.

1663-06-09 20:03   After my coming home comes Pembleton, whether by appointment or no I know not, but I took no notice of.

1663-06-09 13:12   Creed tells me of duodecimal arithmetique, where all is ordered by inches, which are 12 in a foot, which I have a mind to learn.

1663-06-09 12:07   After ordering some things towards my wife’s going into the country, to the office, where I spent the morning upon my measuring rules.

1663-06-08 14:10   After dinner my wife and I had a little jangling, in which she did give me the lie, which vexed me.

1663-06-07 19:38   Mrs. Turner, who is often at Court, do tell me that the Queen hath much changed her humour, and is become very pleasant and sociable as any.

1663-06-07 16:22   My Lady Batten inveighed mightily against the German Princess, and I as high in the defence of her wit and spirit.

1663-06-07 07:07   Lay long talking with my wife, sometimes angry and ended pleased and hope to bring our matters to a better posture in a little time.

1663-06-06 21:47   What a temper of neglect I have myself flung my wife into by my letting her learn to dance, that it will require time to cure her of.

1663-06-06 16:08   I did so practise and improve my measuring of timber, that I can do it with great ease and perfection, which do please me mightily.

1663-06-06 12:04   I was hardly ever so mistaken in my life before.

1663-06-06 12:03   Lay in bed till 7 o’clock, yet rose with an opinion that it was not 5, and so continued till noon and would not believe that it was so late.

1663-06-06 08:07   To York House, where the Russia Embassador do lie; and there I saw his people go up and down louseing themselves.

1663-06-05 16:10   To Mr. Turner’s, and there saw Mr. Edward Pepys’s lady, who my wife concurs with me to be very pretty, as most women we ever saw.

1663-06-05 11:03   To Paul’s Churchyard, where I found several books ready bound for me; among others, the new Concordance of the Bible, which pleases me much.

1663-06-05 10:21   I set my wife at her father’s; but their condition is such that she will not let me see where they live, but goes when I am out of sight.

1663-06-04 20:06   My wife and I to walk in the garden, giving ear to her discourse of her father’s affairs, and I found all well.

1663-06-04 14:38   To the office, my head aching and my mind in trouble for my wife, being jealous of her spending the day, though God knows I have no reason.

1663-06-04 11:32   Home, where by and by comes Dean Honiwood, and I showed him my double horizontal diall, and promise to give him one, and that shall be it.

1663-06-04 09:23   I heard that the Archbishop of Canterbury, Juxon, a man well spoken of by all, is dead; and the Bishop of London is to have his seat.

1663-06-04 05:40   I could not get off my suspicions, my wife having a mind to go into Fenchurch Street, which I must needs construe to be to meet Pembleton.

1663-06-03 20:03   I did from my wife’s unwillingness to tell me whither she had sent the boy, presently suspect that he was gone to Pembleton’s.

1663-06-03 17:48   Deane of Woolwich and I spent all the afternoon finely, learning of him the method of drawing the lines of a ship, to my great satisfaction.

1663-06-03 12:33   I to my office, and there read all the morning in my statute-book, consulting among others the statute against selling of offices.

1663-06-03 05:40   Studying of my double horizontal diall against Dean Honiwood comes to me, who dotes mightily upon it, and I think I must give it him.

1663-06-02 21:10   My wife did tell me of Ashwell stealing some ribbon, a yard or two, which I am sorry to hear. My wife do take a displeasure against her.

1663-06-02 20:04   I did examine the boy, and Will, and told him of his sitting up after we were in bed with the maids, but as to that business he denies it.

1663-06-02 20:02   I was deadly mad at it, and examined my people round, but nobody would confess it.

1663-06-02 19:48   To my great vexation, I find that the cellar door hath long been kept unlocked, and above half the wine drunk.

1663-06-02 19:37   I took occasion with the vintner’s man to taste my tierce of claret, to go down to the cellar with him to consult about the drawing of it.

1663-06-02 14:04   I dined at Sir W. Batten’s, Captain Allen giving them a Foy dinner, he being to go down to lie Admiral in the Downs this summer.

1663-06-01 17:48   They fought at eight weapons, three bouts at each weapon. It was very well worth seeing, because I did think that it has only been a cheat.

1663-06-01 17:44   Other deadly blows they did give and take in very good earnest, till Westwicke was in a most sad pickle.

1663-06-01 17:42   I saw the first prize I ever saw in my life: between one Mathews, who did beat at all weapons, and one Westwicke, who was soundly cut.

1663-06-01 16:58   To the New Theatre, which, since the King’s players are gone to the Royal one, is begun to be employed by the fencers to play prizes at.

1663-06-01 14:50   I hear of the plot which was discovered in Ireland, made among the Presbyters, designing to cry up the Covenant and to secure Dublin Castle.

1663-06-01 13:10   My brother did give us a very pretty dinner, and we very pleasant, but not very merry, Dean Honiwood being but a weak man, though very good.

1663-06-01 04:32   Begun again to rise betimes by 4 o’clock, and made an end of “The Adventures of Five Houres,” and it is a most excellent play.
