1663-02-28 15:42   The House have been with the King to give him their reasons for refusing to grant any indulgence to Presbyters or Papists.

1663-02-28 14:23   At the Privy Seal I did see the docquet by which Sir W. Pen is made the Comptroller’s assistant, which I must endeavour to prevent.

1663-02-27 18:21   To Sir W. Batten’s to speak upon some business, where I found Sir J. Minnes pretty well fuddled I thought.

1663-02-27 15:32   The Doctors conclude that there is no pain in hanging, for that it do stop the circulation of the blood; and so stops all sense and motion.

1663-02-27 14:59   I did touch the dead body with my bare hand: it felt cold, but methought it was a very unpleasant sight.

1663-02-27 14:48   Dr. Scarborough took some of his friends to see the body alone, which was a lusty fellow, a seaman, that was hanged for a robbery.

1663-02-27 13:34   We drank out of a gilt cup given by King Henry VIII, with bells hanging at it, which every man is to ring after he hath drunk the whole cup.

1663-02-27 12:15   All being settled, Dr. Tearne begun his lecture, this being the second upon the kidneys, ureters, &c, which was very fine.

1663-02-27 11:04   To Chyrurgeon’s Hall (we being all invited thither); where we were led into the Theatre; and by and by comes the reader, Dr. Tearne.

1663-02-26 15:02   A young gallant lately come from France, who was full of his French, he had enough to make him think himself a wise man a great while.

1663-02-26 11:15   Pretty it is to consider how the King would appear to be a stiff Protestant; and yet would appear willing to give a liberty to these people.

1663-02-26 11:07   The news is the odds yesterday in the votes between them that are for the Indulgence to the Papists and Presbyters, and those against it.

1663-02-25 18:33   The Commons in Parliament, I hear, are very high to stand to the Act of Uniformity, and will not indulge the Papists nor the Presbyters.

1663-02-25 16:31   To the Temple, my brother’s, the Wardrobe, to Mr. Moore, and other places, called at about small businesses.

1663-02-24 21:42   My late distemper of heat and itching being come upon me again, so that I must think of sweating again as I did before.

1663-02-24 08:19   Waked by Mr. Clerke’s being come to consult me about Field’s business, by calling him up to my bedside, and he says we shall trounce him.

1663-02-23 20:44   My Lady Castlemaine hath all the King’s Christmas presents, made him by the peers, given to her, which is a most abominable thing.

1663-02-23 20:07   To Court, and saw “The Wilde Gallant,” performed by the King’s house, but it was ill acted, and so poor a thing as I never saw in my life.

1663-02-23 17:31   I most pleased to see the little girl dance in boy’s apparel, she having very fine legs, only bends in the hams, as I perceive all women do.

1663-02-23 17:29   To the Duke’s house, where we saw ”The Slighted Mayde” well acted, though the play hath little good in it.

1663-02-23 13:00   I resolved to take my wife to a play at Court to-night, and the rather because it is my birthday, being this day thirty years old.

1663-02-23 12:10   Home, I finding by a note that Mr. Clerke in my absence hath left here, that I am free; and that he hath stopped all matters in Court.

1663-02-23 08:07   Not daring to go by land, did (Griffin going along with me for fear), slip to White Hall by water; where to Mr. Coventry.

1663-02-22 17:44   That which troubled me most was Sir J. Minnes coming from Court. He tells me that the Duke and Mr. Coventry make no great matter of it.

1663-02-22 17:32   To Sir W. Batten’s and Sir W. Pen’s, where discoursing much of yesterday’s trouble and scandal.

1663-02-21 17:44   The men are not contented with under 5l. for their charges, which Mr. Clerke will not give them, and he advises me not to stir abroad.

1663-02-21 17:14   I walked through the street to show myself among the neighbours, that they might not think worse than the business is.

1663-02-21 16:50   These fellows, which are called the commissioners, are the most rake-shamed rogues that ever I saw in my life.

1663-02-21 16:38   Mr. Clerke, our solicitor, brings us a release from our adverse atturney, we paying the fees of the commission, which comes to five marks.

1663-02-21 14:40   By ladders I did get over the pale between our yards, and so to Sir W. Batten’s house, where I found them to be concerned for me.

1663-02-21 14:25   By and by at my parler-window comes Sir W. Batten’s Mungo, to tell me that his master and lady would have me come to their house.

1663-02-21 13:10   The bayleys come back, but found me not there; and I hearing in what manner they were come, did forbear letting them know where I was.

1663-02-21 12:22   The man and four more of his fellows came to know what I would do; I told them stay till I heard from the King or my Lord Chief Baron.

1663-02-21 12:10   Our solicitor against Field came by chance and told me that he would go and satisfy the fees of the Court, and would end the business.

1663-02-21 11:52   There comes a man, and shows me a writ from the Exchequer, called a Commission of Rebellion, tells me I am his prisoner in Field’s business.

1663-02-20 15:28   To the Charles pleasure boat, and I could have been sick if I would in going, the wind being very fresh, but very pleasant it was.

1663-02-20 09:12   To Deptford and looked over the yard and had a call, wherein I am very highly pleased with our new manner of call-books, being my invention.

1663-02-19 23:58   Home and to bed, being weary, sleepy, and my eyes begin to fail me, looking so long by candlelight upon white paper.

1663-02-19 13:34   To my office, this afternoon being the first we have met upon a great while, our times being changed because of the parliament sitting.

1663-02-18 11:14   Casting up with Captain Cocke their accounts of 500 tons of hemp from Riga, bought upon account, wherein are many things worth my knowledge.

1663-02-17 19:22   My wife’s sister will give her husband trouble enough as little as she is, whereas I took her heretofore for a very child and a simple fool.

1663-02-17 19:20   We sent for my wife’s sister’s viall, upon which she plays pretty well for a girl, but my expectation is much deceived in her.

1663-02-17 16:25   The Queen-Mother’s Court is now the greatest of all; our own Queen hath little or no company come to her, which I am sorry to see it.

1663-02-17 16:07   Mr. Pickering tells me the story is true of a child being dropped at the ball at Court; the King had it in his closett, and did dissect it.

1663-02-16 13:47   To my Lord Crew’s and dined there, there being much company, and the above-said matter is now the present publique discourse.

1663-02-16 10:55   A priest was taken in his vests officiating somewhere in Holborn the other day, and was committed by Secretary Morris, according to law.

1663-02-16 10:07   The great question is, whether the Presbyters will be contented to have the Papists have the same liberty of conscience with them, or no.

1663-02-15 05:43   It put me to very horrid pain; and what should this be but my cods, which after I woke were in very great pain for a good while.

1663-02-15 05:40   My wife did wake me being frighted with the noise I made in my sleep, a dream that one of our sea maisters did desire to see my drawing.

1663-02-14 13:55   Home to dinner, my wife and I upon a couple of ducks.

1663-02-13 20:25   I would not choose Valentines because of getting charge both to me for mine and to them for her, which did not please her.

1663-02-13 20:20   My wife had a great mind to choose Valentines against to-morrow, I Mrs. Clerke, or Pierce, she Mr. Hunt or Captain Ferrers.

1663-02-13 16:10   My Lord Windsor is come home from Jamaica, unlooked-for; which makes us think that these young Lords are not fit to do any service abroad.

1663-02-13 11:40   Our maid Susan is very ill, and so the whole trouble of the house lies upon our maid Mary, who do it very contentedly and mighty well.

1663-02-13 10:07   Mr. Cole, our timber merchant, sent me five couple of ducks.

1663-02-12 14:20   Mary Ashwell dined with us, and after dinner went away again, being agreed to come to us about three weeks or a month hence.

1663-02-12 12:10   My wife’s brother brought Mary Ashwell with him, whom we find a likely person to please us, both for person, discourse, and other qualitys.

1663-02-11 22:07   My wife read Sir H. Vane’s tryall to me, and I find it a very excellent thing, worth reading, and him to have been a very wise man.

1663-02-11 14:40   Our new maid Mary has played her part very well in her readiness and discretion in attending me, of which I am very glad.

1663-02-11 13:48   My wife and I dined on a pullet and I eat heartily, having eat nothing but water gruel and posset drink.

1663-02-10 19:22   Sir W. Warren left a state dish of silver, and cup, with my arms ready cut upon them, which is a noble present, and the best I ever had.

1663-02-10 11:02   Most of my disease, itching and pimples, are gone. I am glad to see that I am so much inquired after and my sickness taken notice of.

1663-02-09 22:31   Sir J. Minnes’ Venice treacle being better than the others, I did take it and fell into a great sweat, and came out of it.

1663-02-09 08:13   It being some disorder given the blood, but by what I know not, unless it be by my late quantitys of Dantzic-girkins that I have eaten.

1663-02-09 08:10   By the Apothecary’s advice, I am to sweat soundly, and that will carry all this matter away which nature would of itself eject.

1663-02-09 06:30   I had a very bad night of it, in great pain in my stomach, and in great fever.

1663-02-08 19:49   I found this afternoon that all my body is inflamed, and my face in a sad redness and swelling and pimpled.

1663-02-08 15:28   At Court, a child was dropped by one of the ladies in dancing, but nobody knew who, it being taken up by somebody in their handkercher.

1663-02-08 11:00   Though a great scholler, Dr. Duport made the most flat dead sermon, that ever I heard, and very long beyond his hour, which made it worse.

1663-02-08 10:07   To chappell, where there preached little Dr. Duport, of Cambridge, upon Josiah’s words, “But I and my house, we will serve the Lord.”

1663-02-07 20:44   To my writing of letters late, and making my Alphabet to my new Navy book very pretty.

1663-02-06 16:48   To my Lord Sandwich, there being a Committee to sit upon the contract for the Mole, which I dare say none of us that were there understood.

1663-02-06 11:55   I bought Hudibras again, it being some ill humour to be so against that which all the world cries up to be the example of wit.

1663-02-06 11:30   It being too soon to go to dinner, I looked upon the outside of the new theatre, now a-building in Covent Garden, which will be very fine.

1663-02-05 22:10   I walked home, it being a great frost still, and to my office, there late writing letters of business, and so home to supper and to bed.

1663-02-05 14:07   I found dinner so well done, above what I did expect from my mayde Susan, now Jane is gone, that I did call her in and give her sixpence.

1663-02-04 20:07   To the office, where after doing some business I went home, where I found our new mayde Mary, that is come in Jane’s place.

1663-02-04 11:44   Dr. Crumlum did me honour by telling many what a present I had made to the school, shewing my Stephanus, in four volumes, cost me 4l. 10s.

1663-02-04 11:32   I went up to see the head forms posed in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, but I think they did not answer in any so well as we did.

1663-02-04 09:07   To Paul’s School. I heard some of their speeches, of the seven liberal sciences; but I think not so good as ours were in our time.

1663-02-03 14:15   Mr. Ashwell’s daughter will be fit, I think, as any for our turn. The conditions I know not what they will be, he leaving it wholly to her.

1663-02-03 13:55   Mr. Creed dined with me, and Mr. Ashwell, with whom after dinner I discoursed concerning his daughter coming to live with us.

1663-02-02 17:33   Home and there found Jane gone. I could hardly forbear shedding tears for fear the poor wench should come to any ill condition.

1663-02-02 15:15   I called at my brother’s, who is at church, at the buriall of young Cumberland, a lusty young man.

1663-02-02 13:48   Mr. Gawden and I did fall out, he defending himself in the readiness of his provision, when I know that the ships everywhere stay for them.

1663-02-02 10:03   Mr. Ashwell’s wife came to me, and by discourse I perceive their daughter is very fit for my turn if my family may be as much for hers.

1663-02-02 07:07   After paying Jane her wages I went away because I could hardly forbear weeping. She cried, saying it was not her fault that she went away.

1663-02-01 16:32   Walking in White Hall garden we did see the King coming privately from my Lady Castlemaine’s; which is a poor thing for a Prince to do.

1663-02-01 13:51   I was pleased to see dinner neatly done, and this troubled me to think of parting with Jane, that is come to be a good cook.
