1663-12-31 23:59   Myself in a good way, and resolution of sticking to my business to get a little money with doing the best service I can to the King.

1663-12-31 23:48   The Turke very far entered into Germany, and all that part of the world at a losse what to expect from his proceedings.

1663-12-31 23:35   Pall with my father and God knows what will become of her. I have not anything to spare her, and she grows now old, and must be disposed of.

1663-12-31 23:22   My brother Tom I know not what to think of; and my brother John at Cambridge, with as little hopes of doing good there.

1663-12-31 23:10   The Queene after a long and sore sicknesse is become well again; and the King minds his mistresse a little too much, if it pleased God!

1663-12-31 22:56   My father and mother well in the country; and the young ladies of Hinchingbroke with them, their house having the small-pox in it.

1663-12-31 22:47   The rest either love me, or at least do not show otherwise, though I know Sir W. Pen to be a false knave touching me, though he seems fair.

1663-12-31 22:39   At the office I am well, though envied to the devil by Sir William Batten, who hates me to death, but cannot hurt me.

1663-12-31 22:27   My health good, but only that I have been much troubled with a costiveness which I am labouring to get away, and have hopes of doing it.

1663-12-31 22:15   I live at my lodgings in the Navy Office, my family being, besides my wife and I, Jane Gentleman, Besse, our cookmayde, and Susan, a girle.

1663-12-31 22:03   I bless God I do find that I am worth in money, besides all my household stuff, or any thing of Brampton, above 800l.

1663-12-31 17:03   I sat an hour or two at the Coffee house, hearing some simple discourse about Quakers being charmed by a string about their wrists.

1663-12-31 14:25   To-morrow my vowes are all out as to plays and wine, but I hope I shall come to new ones, so much good, I find to have attended them.

1663-12-31 14:10   We had to dinner, my wife and I, a fine turkey and a mince pie, and she and I have thus kept our Christmas together all alone almost.

1663-12-30 11:15   I talked with Sir W. Petty about his new vessel. He did give me such satisfaction that I am confident she will prove an admirable invention.

1663-12-30 09:03   With Mr. Coventry by coach to London, with good and friendly discourse of business and against Sir W. Batten and his foul dealings.

1663-12-30 07:55   My Lord Sandwich did aske me how his cozen, my wife, did, the first time he hath done so since his being offended.

1663-12-29 14:55   I told Luellin I will never give himself thanks for it, not acknowledging the receiving of any, which he told me was reasonable.

1663-12-29 14:50   Luellin took me up to my chamber to give me 50l. for the service I did him, though not so great as he expected and I intended.

1663-12-29 14:03   With Mr. Pierse, Mr. Luellin and Mount to dinner, but their discourse so free about claps and other foul discourse that I was weary of them.

1663-12-28 20:18   I had a stove brought me to try, but it being an old one it smokes as if there was nothing but a hearth, but it may be new ones do not.

1663-12-28 18:10   Home and found my wife gone out to have a tooth drawn, she having been in pain all day, and at night came home with it drawn, and well.

1663-12-28 14:30   I paid Mr. Hollyard 3l. for his physic and work to my wife about her evill below, but whether it is cured for ever or no I cannot tell.

1663-12-28 10:18   The King beat three, and lost two sets, they all, and he particularly playing well, I thought.

1663-12-28 10:15   I saw the King and Sir Arthur Slingsby play against my Lord of Suffolke and my Lord Chesterfield.

1663-12-28 09:22   Walking through White Hall I heard the King was gone to play at Tennis, so I down to the new Tennis Court.

1663-12-27 13:10   To dinner with my wife pleased with one another’s company, and in our enjoyment one of another, better we think than most other couples do.

1663-12-26 21:33   Rushworth is a book the most worth reading for any man that hopes to come to any publique condition in the world that I do know.

1663-12-26 16:06   God forgive me! to see how the discourse of plays, which I shall be at liberty to see after New Year’s Day next, do set my mind upon them.

1663-12-26 11:20   To the Coffee-house, and sat long in good discourse with some gentlemen concerning the Roman Empire.

1663-12-26 09:45   I walked forth first to the Minerys to Brown’s, and there with great pleasure saw and bespoke several instruments.

1663-12-25 22:10   At the office reading Rushworth, which is a most excellent collection of the beginning of the late quarrels in this kingdom.

1663-12-25 17:04   I began to read to my wife upon the globes with pleasure, for it will be pleasant to her and to me to have her understand these things.

1663-12-25 15:20   Looking out at window and seeing the boys playing at many sports in our back yard by Sir W. Pen’s, which reminded me of my own former times.

1663-12-25 13:50   To church, where Mr. Mills made an ordinary sermon, and so home and dined with great pleasure with my wife.

1663-12-24 12:16   Straight home, being very cold, but yet well, I thank God, and at home found my wife making mince pies.

1663-12-24 07:15   Though it was a most foggy morning, and cold, yet with a gally down to Eriffe, several times being at a loss whither we went.

1663-12-23 22:22   Doing business also to my content to see God bless me in my opening honest ways, I hope to get a little money and yet to live handsomely.

1663-12-23 11:32   We in my Lord Sandwich’s coach, next to Mrs Turner’s mourning coach, and so through the City and Shoreditch, I believe about twenty coaches.

1663-12-23 11:06   Much company came, and anon, the corps being put into the hearse, and the scutcheons set upon it, we all took coach.

1663-12-23 09:03   Being in as mourning a dress as we could, at present, without cost, put ourselves into, we by Sir W. Pen’s coach to Mrs. Turner’s.

1663-12-22 15:09   Lord! to see how near I was to have broken my oathe, or run the hazard of 20s. losse, so much my nature was hot to have gone thither.

1663-12-22 15:07   The King and Duke and all the Court was going to the Duke’s playhouse to see “Henry VIII” acted, which is said to be an admirable play.

1663-12-22 12:45   My Lord hath ordered his coach and six horses for me to-morrow, which pleases me mightily to think that my Lord should do so much.

1663-12-21 19:36   I made a desire for to have my Lord’s coach to go along with my cozen Edward Pepys’s hearse through the City, which he granted me.

1663-12-21 18:22   Captain Cooke and his two boys did sing some Italian songs, which I think was fully the best musique that I ever yet heard in all my life.

1663-12-21 16:51   It is strange to see how people of this poor rank shall bet three or four pounds at one bet and lose it and yet bet as much the next battle.

1663-12-21 16:35   Sometimes a cock that has had ten to one against him will by chance give an unlucky blow, will strike the other starke dead in a moment.

1663-12-21 16:23   It being strange to observe the nature of these poor creatures, how they will fight till they drop down dead upon the table.

1663-12-21 15:56   Lord! to see the strange variety of people, from Parliament-man to the poorest ‘prentices, bakers, brewers, butchers, draymen, and what not.

1663-12-21 15:41   Directed by sight of bills upon the walls, I did go to Shoe Lane to see a cocke-fighting at a new pit, a sport I was never at in my life.

1663-12-21 13:58   After dinner won a wager of a payre of gloves of a crowne of Mr. Gauden upon some words in his contract for victualling.

1663-12-20 20:39   We were as merry as I could be with people that I do wish well to, but know not what discourse either to give them or find from them.

1663-12-20 18:22   In comes my uncle Wight and Mr. Norbury, and they sat with us a while drinking, of wine, of which I did give them plenty.

1663-12-20 17:07   Home, and there I found my brother Tom and my two cozens Scotts, he and she, the first time they were ever here.

1663-12-20 13:14   Home to dinner in our parler, my wife being clean, and the first time we have dined here a great while together.

1663-12-19 17:49   To Mrs. Turner’s, whom I find busy with Sir W. Turner, advising upon going down to Norfolke with the corps. I find him a considering man.

1663-12-19 15:23   By coach to my shoemaker’s and paid all there, and gave something to the boys’ box against Christmas.

1663-12-18 12:14   I met with content in a book I bought yesterday, a discourse of the state of Rome under the present Pope, it being a very excellent piece.

1663-12-18 08:33   I took water (taking a dram of the bottle at the waterside) with a gally, the first that ever I had, and to Woolwich, calling at Ham Creeke.

1663-12-17 16:49   My cozen Edward Pepys died after a day’s raveing, through lightness in his head for want of sleep. His lady did not know of his sickness.

1663-12-17 15:58   I went to the Temple, and there spent my time in a Bookseller’s shop, reading in a book of some Embassages into Moscovia, &c.

1663-12-17 14:44   To Mrs. Turner’s where I have not been for many a day, and there I found her and her sister Dike very sad for the death of their brother.

1663-12-16 12:10   Up, and with my head and heart full of my business, I to my office, and there all the morning.

1663-12-15 23:34   Sir W. Warren did give me most admirable advice, and such as do speak him understanding seven times more than ever I thought to be in him.

1663-12-15 07:11   My brother’s man came to tell me that my cozen, Edward Pepys, was dead, died at Mrs. Turner’s, for which my wife and I are very sorry.

1663-12-14 20:29   Commissioner Pett did let fall several scurvy words concerning my pretending to know masts as well as any body.

1663-12-14 14:41   They say that the King of France hath hired threescore ships of Holland, and forty of the Swede, but nobody knows what to do.

1663-12-14 10:55   When I did hear how my Lord hath wholly left Chelsy, and the slut, and that I see he do follow his business, I am rejoiced to see it.

1663-12-14 10:20   It did trouble me to hear my Lord swear before God and other oathes, as he did now and then, which methinks did so ill become him.

1663-12-13 17:05   We talked about the Joyces, how they are sometimes all honey one with another and then all turd, and a strange life there is among them.

1663-12-13 16:49   I spent all the afternoon in my chamber talking of many things with Tom, and about Wheately’s daughter for a wife for him.

1663-12-12 16:04   My Lord Barkeley hath letters from France that the King hath unduked twelve Dukes, only to show his power and to crush his nobility.

1663-12-12 12:22   One Abrahall has sent my wife a Japan gowne, which pleases her very well and me also, but I know not how to carry myself to him.

1663-12-11 21:43   To my joy I have almost brought myself by going often and leisurely to the stool that I am come almost to have my natural course of stool.

1663-12-11 11:48   The Duke sends that no wolves be killed by the people; and whatever harm they do, the Duke makes it good to the person that suffers it.

1663-12-11 10:07   A merchant tells of discouraging our manufacture in Iron by suffering the Swede to bring in three times more and our owne Ironworks be lost.

1663-12-11 09:24   I to the Wardrobe and there missed Mr. Moore. So to Mr. Holden’s and evened all reckonings there for hats.

1663-12-10 17:39   And Hudibras, both parts, the book now in greatest fashion for drollery, though I cannot, I confess, see enough where the wit lies.

1663-12-10 17:37   I chose Dr. Fuller’s Worthys, the Cabbala or Collections of Letters of State, with another book or two, all of good use or serious pleasure.

1663-12-10 16:49   I could not tell whether to lay out my money for books of pleasure, as plays, which my nature was most earnest in.

1663-12-10 16:28   To St. Paul’s Church Yard, to my bookseller’s, and I did here sit two or three hours calling for twenty books to lay money out upon.

1663-12-10 12:58   Home to dinner (and did drink a glass of wine and beer, the more for joy that this is the shortest day in the year) with my wife.

1663-12-09 15:48   Mrs. Russell did give my wife a very fine St. George, in alabaster, which will set out my wife’s closett mightily.

1663-12-09 10:13   To my office again, and then abroad to look out a cradle to burn charcoal in at my office, and I found one to my mind in Newgate Market.

1663-12-08 18:42   My Lord Sandwich did bid me good night in a tone that, methinks, he is not so displeased with me as I did doubt he is.

1663-12-08 14:58   To White Hall, where a while walked with my Lord Tiviott, whom I find a most carefull, thoughtfull and cunning man as I ever took him to be.

1663-12-07 15:07   After dinner by coach, home, and found my wife this cold day not yet out of bed, and after a little good talk with her to my office.

1663-12-07 13:35   The King of France, they say, is hiring of sixty sail of ships of the Dutch, but it is not said for what design.

1663-12-07 12:48   The King and Duke and Duchesse came to dinner in the Vane-roome; it seems since the tables are done, he dines there all together.

1663-12-07 10:07   I do not find that my Lord of Sandwich made any sign of kindnesse or respect to me, which troubles me more than any thing in the world.

1663-12-07 08:32   I find that there was the last night the greatest tide that ever was remembered in England: all White Hall having been drowned.

1663-12-06 22:15   To prayers and bed, finding myself by cold to have some pain begin with me, which God defend should increase.

1663-12-06 17:32   I purpose not to trouble my wife yet with Division, but to begin with the Globes to her now.

1663-12-06 17:30   My wife and I all the afternoon at arithmetique, and she is come to do Addition, Subtraction, and Multiplicacion very well.

1663-12-06 13:08   Home to dinner, my wife, it being a cold day, and it begun to snow (the first snow we have seen this year) kept her bed till after dinner.

1663-12-06 11:00   To church alone, which is the greatest trouble that I have by not having a man or, boy to wait on me.

1663-12-05 22:24   To bed after talke and Arithmetique with my poor wife with whom now-a-days I live with great content out of all trouble of mind by jealousy.

1663-12-05 13:48   I was pleased with the excellent stories told by Mr. Coventry, which I have put down in my book of tales and so shall not mention them here.

1663-12-05 12:55   With Captain Allen to dinner, in a pretty house but so smoky that it was troublesome till they put out the fire, and made one of charcoale.

1663-12-04 22:14   All the afternoon at my office till night, and then home to keep my poor wife company, and so to supper and to bed.

1663-12-04 11:04   By water with Henry Russell, cold and wet and windy to Woolwich, to a hempe ship, and staid giving direction as to the getting it ashore.

1663-12-03 16:32   Somebody from Portsmouth, I know not who, has this day sent me a Runlett of Tent.

1663-12-03 10:11   Sir G. Carteret did tell us at the table, that the Navy is quite out of debt; which is extraordinary good newes.

1663-12-02 15:04   Met Mr. Bland’s antagonist Mr. Custos, and begun the dispute about the freight of a ship hired by Mr. Bland to carry provisions to Tangier.

1663-12-02 07:50   My wife troubled all last night with the toothache and this morning.

1663-12-01 16:52   To hear how sillily the Counsel and judge would speak as to the terms necessary in the matter, would make one laugh.

1663-12-01 16:44   After one witnesse for the plaintiff, it was cried down as a most notorious cheate; the jury, without going out, found it for the plaintiff.

1663-12-01 14:20   I to Guild Hall to hear a tryall at King’s Bench, before Lord Chief Justice Hide, about the insurance of a ship.

1663-12-01 12:10   I home to dinner with my poor wife, with whom now-a-days I enjoy great pleasure in her company and learning of Arithmetique.
