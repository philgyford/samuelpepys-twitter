1663-05-31 21:59   I find myself growing in esteem in the office. I hope falling to my business will confirm me in it, and the saving of money which God grant!

1663-05-31 19:22   The King of France was given out to be poisoned and dead; but it proves to be the measles: and he is well, or likely to be soon well again.

1663-05-31 17:03   Yet I might have been better by 20l. almost had I forborne some layings out in dancing and other things upon my wife, and going to plays.

1663-05-31 17:01   I to make up my month’s accounts, and find myself clear worth 726l., for which God be praised.

1663-05-31 15:19   I read part of the new play of “The Five Houres’ Adventures,” it being a play of the greatest plot that ever I expect to see.

1663-05-31 07:53   Will having neglected to brush my clothes I was angry, and him seeming to make it a matter indifferent, I did give him a box on the ear.

1663-05-31 07:20   I do plainly see that my wife’s distaste against Ashwell arises from her jealousy of me and her, and my neglect of herself, which is true.

1663-05-30 22:12   Home, and after supper did wash my feet, and so to bed.

1663-05-30 20:52   At my office getting up the time that I have lost by not following my business, but I hope now to settle my mind again well to my business.

1663-05-30 06:02   Creed and I walked to the New Exchange, and there drank our morning draught of whay, the first I have done this year.

1663-05-29 21:04   God forgive me I could scarce stay myself from going into the whores’ houses, so apt is my nature to evil after set upon pleasure again.

1663-05-29 20:59   I did take two turns forwards and backwards through the Fleete Ally to see a couple of pretty whores that stood off the doors there.

1663-05-29 17:41   To the Duke’s house, and saw “The Slighted Mayde,” wherein Gosnell acted Pyramena, and did it well, and I believe will prove a good actor.

1663-05-29 11:01   It is a wonder to see, that in some churches there was hardly ten people in the whole church, and those poor people.

1663-05-29 07:40   This day is kept strictly as a holy-day, being the King’s Coronation. We lay long in bed, and it rained very hard, rain and hail.

1663-05-28 17:28   To the Duke’s House; and there saw “Hamlett” done, giving us fresh reason never to think enough of Betterton.

1663-05-28 11:48   The book is dedicated to all men of any great condition. The Epistles are more than the book itself and both it and them not worth a turd.

1663-05-28 11:43   At the coffee-house in Exchange Alley I bought a little book, “Counsell to Builders,” by Sir Balth. Gerbier.

1663-05-28 09:52   I hear that the King had letters yesterday from France that the King there is in a way of living again, which I am glad to hear.

1663-05-27 20:15   We were merry, and I made myself so, and kind to Pembleton as much as I could, though I perceive to my trouble that he knows all.

1663-05-27 18:59   We went up, and we danced country dances, and single, my wife and I; my wife paid Pembleton off for this month also, and so he is cleared.

1663-05-27 17:35   My wife tells me that Pembleton had been there, and she would not have him come in unless I was there, which I was ashamed of.

1663-05-27 15:07   This day there was great thronging to Banstead Downs, upon a great horse-race and foot-race. I am sorry I could not go thither.

1663-05-27 14:42   My Lord says he cannot endure a merry tune, which is a strange turn, after he has for two or three years flung off the practice of Fancies.

1663-05-27 10:57   By water to Chelsey, all the way reading a little book I bought of “Improvement of Trade,” a pretty book and many things useful in it.

1663-05-27 09:20   Roger Pepys thinks to marry again. He would have me look out a widow between thirty and forty years old, without children, with a fortune.

1663-05-27 05:24   After awhile I caressed my wife and parted seeming friends, but she crying in a great discontent.

1663-05-27 05:07   I found very good reason to think that my wife’s freedom with Pembleton is very great and more than was convenient, but with no evil intent.

1663-05-27 04:32   I began to tax my wife’s discretion in yesterday’s business, but she quickly told me my own, knowing that it was my old disease of jealousy.

1663-05-27 04:12   I seemed going to rise, though only to see what my wife would do, and going out of the bed she took hold of me and would know what ailed me.

1663-05-27 03:03   I waked, my mind being troubled, and so took occasion by making water to wake my wife.

1663-05-26 21:22   Though my wife would have spoke of business to me, I construed it to be but impudence, and I did say nothing, being in a doubt what to do.

1663-05-26 18:49   Lord! to see how my jealousy wrought so far that I went softly up to see whether any of the beds were out of order or no, which I found not.

1663-05-26 16:37   I went home to see how things were. I found as I doubted Mr. Pembleton with my wife, and nobody else in the house, which made me almost mad.

1663-05-26 10:55   I pray God my devilish jealousy may be false, but it makes a very hell in my mind, which the God of heaven remove, or I shall be unhappy.

1663-05-26 10:48   Home, where I found Pembleton, and I am led to conclude there is something more than ordinary between my wife and him, which do trouble me.

1663-05-26 07:30   Lay long in bed talking and pleasing myself with my wife.

1663-05-25 20:09   The King has two of the stones in his closett, and by the King’s command the turd of the horse to be every day searched to find more.

1663-05-25 20:07   A horse lately voided at his fundament four stones, bigger than that I was cut of, and in the middle of each either a piece of iron or wood.

1663-05-25 16:30   News came last night to Court, that the King of France is sick of the spotted fever, and that they are struck in again.

1663-05-25 10:57   I believe it will cost me 4l. more to fit my wife out, but I am willing so as to keep all ends together, and my power over her undisturbed.

1663-05-25 10:55   Ashwell did come to me with an errand from my wife to desire money to buy a country suit for her against she goes, and so I did give her 4l.

1663-05-25 09:13   My wife and her maid Ashwell had spilled the pot of piss and turd upon the floor and God knows what, and were merry making of it clean.

1663-05-25 08:42   Sarah Kite is a good-natured and painful wretch, and one that I would do good for as far as I can that I might not be burdened.

1663-05-25 08:40   Sarah Kite my cozen, poor woman, came to see me and borrow 40s. of me, telling me she will pay it at Michaelmas again to me.

1663-05-24 22:05   I read to my wife a fable or two in Ogleby’s Æsop, and so to supper, and then to prayers and to bed.

1663-05-24 15:29   I must have patience and get my wife into the country, or at least to make an end of her learning to dance as soon as I can.

1663-05-24 15:27   I am loth to think the worst, but it do keep me at a great loss in my mind, and makes me curse the time that I consented to my wife dancing.

1663-05-24 15:25   With the consideration of my wife being desirous to go to church forenoon and afternoon do make me suspect something more than ordinary.

1663-05-24 15:20   I observed my wife made a curtsey to Pembleton at coming out without taking notice to me at all of it.

1663-05-24 15:02   Over against our gallery I espied Pembleton, and saw him leer upon my wife all the sermon, I taking no notice of him.

1663-05-24 14:04   My wife telling me there was a pretty lady come to church to-day, I against my intention had a mind to go to church to see her, and did so.

1663-05-24 09:20   Having taken one of Mr. Holliard’s pills last night it brought a stool or two this morning, and so forebore going to church.

1663-05-24 07:30   It seems Susan is since she went from me taught to drink, and so gets out of doors 2 or 3 times a day without leave to the alehouse.

1663-05-23 17:03   We saw a draught of the arms of the Barbary company. The motto too tedious: “Regio floret, patrocinio commercium, commercioque Regnum.”

1663-05-23 04:32   Waked by my blackbird, which whistles as well as ever I heard; only it is the beginning of many tunes, but leaves them, and goes no further.

1663-05-22 15:24   By water to Greenwich, we walked pleasantly to Woolwich, in our way hearing the nightingales sing.

1663-05-22 11:55   To my office, and busy all the morning, among other things, learning to understand the course of the tides, and I think I do now do it.

1663-05-22 07:22   Rundall hath sent me a fine blackbird, which I went to see. He tells me he was offered 20s. for him as he came along, he do so whistle.

1663-05-21 20:32   My wife’s mind finds other sweets besides pleasing of me, and so makes her that she begins not to take pleasure in me as heretofore.

1663-05-21 20:30   I fear I shall go near to lose my command over my wife, and nothing do it more than giving her this occasion of dancing and other pleasures.

1663-05-21 13:10   To dinner, my wife and I having high words about her dancing to that degree that I did enter and make a vow to myself not to oppose her.

1663-05-21 06:02   Up, but cannot get up so early as I was wont, nor my mind to business as it should be and used to be before this dancing.

1663-05-20 22:07   Pembleton coming, we danced a country dance or two and so broke up and to bed, my mind restless and like to be so while she learns to dance.

1663-05-20 14:20   I met Pembleton, who has dined with my wife, which she takes no notice of, but whether that proceeds out of fear to displease me I know not.

1663-05-19 20:17   My damned jealousy took fire, Pembleton and my wife being of a side and I seeing of him take her by the hand in play.

1663-05-19 19:44   By water (taking Pembleton with us), over the water to the Halfway House, where we played at ninepins.

1663-05-19 14:29   To the Assay Office and saw the manner of assaying of gold and silver, and how silver melted down with gold do part, which is a miracle.

1663-05-19 10:15   To the Tower; and by Mr. Slingsby, and Mr. Howard, Controller of the Mint, we were shown the method of making this new money.

1663-05-19 05:42   I observe how my dancing and lying a morning or two longer than ordinary for my cold do make me hard to rise as I used to do.

1663-05-18 19:10   To the Park, where we saw many fine faces, and one exceeding handsome, in a white dress over her head, with many others very beautiful.

1663-05-18 17:46   Mrs. Stuart is a fine woman, and they say now a common mistress to the King, as my Lady Castlemaine is; which is a great pity.

1663-05-18 16:06   Lord! in what a poor condition Mrs. Clerke’s best chamber is, and things about her, for all the outside and show that she makes.

1663-05-17 20:30   To bed having another small falling out and myself vexed with my old fit of jealousy about her dancing-master. But I am a fool for doing it.

1663-05-17 12:05   In my chamber all the morning, preparing my great letters to my father, stating to him the perfect condition of our estate.

1663-05-16 15:15   I did go up to them to practise, and did make an end of “La Duchesse,” which I think I should, with a little pains, do very well.

1663-05-16 14:44   Lord! with what jealousy did I walk up and down my chamber listening to hear whether Pembleton and my wife danced or no, which they did.

1663-05-16 06:00   I do not find honesty enough in my own mind but that upon temptation I could be false to her, therefore ought not to expect more from her.

1663-05-16 05:55   Up with my mind disturbed and with my last night’s doubts upon me. For which I deserve to be beaten.

1663-05-15 22:48   I am ashamed to think what a course I did take by lying to see whether my wife did wear drawers to-day as she used to do.

1663-05-15 22:40   Late home again and ready to chide at every thing, and then suddenly to bed and could hardly sleep, yet durst not say any thing.

1663-05-15 20:34   So deadly full of jealousy I am that my heart and head did so cast about and fret that I could not do any business, but went to my office.

1663-05-15 20:30   Home, where I found it almost night, and my wife and the dancing-master alone above, not dancing but talking.

1663-05-15 18:07   The old women had like to have killed, the other day, the Bishop of Galloway, and not half the Churches of the whole kingdom conform.

1663-05-15 16:46   My Lord Hinchingbroke, I am told, hath had a mischance to kill his boy by his birding-piece going off as he was a-fowling.

1663-05-15 15:24   My Lady Castlemaine rules the King who hath all the tricks of Aretin that are practised to give pleasure. In which he is able having a large…

1663-05-15 13:10   There was a falling-out two days ago at my Lord of Oxford’s house, where there were high words and blows, and pulling off of perriwiggs.

1663-05-15 07:03   The keeper of the Pell Mell told me of what the earth is mixed that do floor the Mall, that there is cockle-shells powdered to keep it fast.

1663-05-14 14:22   We received a baskett from my sister Pall, made by her of paper, which hath a great deal of labour in it for country innocent work.

1663-05-14 10:10   The King did send for my Lord the other day to my Lady Castlemaine’s, to play at cards, where he lost 50l.; for which I am sorry.

1663-05-14 07:49   Mr. Moore fears the King will be tempted to endeavour the setting the Crown upon the little Duke, which may cause troubles.

1663-05-13 22:06   Home to supper, to cards, and to bed.

1663-05-13 16:45   One-eyed Cooper came to see me and I made him to show me the use of platts, and to understand the lines, and how to find how lands bear, &c.

1663-05-13 14:22   Lord! to see how my wife will not be thought to need telling by me or Ashwell, and yet will plead that she has learnt but a month.

1663-05-12 20:45   To my office, our chief business being the reconciling the business of the pieces of eight mentioned yesterday before the Duke of York.

1663-05-12 12:27   A little angry with my wife for minding nothing now but the dancing-master, having him come twice a day, which is a folly.

1663-05-11 20:04   Mr. Crumlum’s wife is a pretty woman, never yet with child, and methinks looks as if her mouth watered now and then upon some of her boys.

1663-05-11 17:53   The other day Dr. Clerke and Mr. Pierce did dissect two bodies, a man and a woman; before the King, with which the King was highly pleased.

1663-05-11 15:10   A dispute about the pieces of eight rated by Mr Creed at 4s and 5d, and by Pitts at 4s and 9d, which was the greatest husbandry to the King?

1663-05-11 11:34   Home, and both coming and going did con my lesson on my Ruler to measure timber, which I think I can well undertake now to do.

1663-05-11 09:22   Lord, to see in what a maze I was, that, having a sword about me, I never thought of it, but might, for want of courage, have been worried.

1663-05-11 09:20   On foot to Greenwich, where going I was set upon by a great dogg, who got hold of my garters, and might have done me hurt.

1663-05-10 14:52   Among other things, talking of the way of ordinaries, that it is very convenient, because a man knows what he hath to pay.

1663-05-10 13:13   The Bishop of Galloway was besieged in his house by some women, and had like to have been outraged, but I know not how he was secured.

1663-05-10 05:32   Up betimes, and put on a black cloth suit, with white lynings under all, as the fashion is to wear, to appear under the breeches.

1663-05-09 15:10   I did try three borders and perriwiggs, meaning to wear one; yet I have no stomach, but that the pains of keeping my hair clean is so great.

1663-05-08 17:47   I am resolved to deny myself the liberty of two plays at Court, which are in arreare to me for the months of March and April.

1663-05-08 17:45   My oath against going to plays do not oblige me against this house, because it was not then in being.

1663-05-08 17:24   Shamed that my wife and woman were in such a pickle, all the ladies being finer and better dressed in the pitt than they used to be.

1663-05-08 17:01   The play was “The Humerous Lieutenant,” a play that hath little good in it, nor much in the very part which Lacy now acts instead of Clun.

1663-05-08 14:32   The house is made with extraordinary good contrivance, and yet hath some faults, as the narrowness of the passages in and out of the Pitt.

1663-05-08 14:10   To my brother’s, and there took up my wife and Ashwell to the Theatre Royall, being the second day of its being opened.

1663-05-08 10:06   To visit my Lady Jemimah, who is grown much since I saw her; but lacks mightily to be brought into the fashion of the court to set her off.

1663-05-07 13:23   The House have made an order for an Act for rendering none capable of employment in the State, but who have been loyall to King and Church.

1663-05-06 21:09   A practice of my coranto I began with Mr. Pembleton the other day, and I begin to think that I shall be able to do something at it in time.

1663-05-06 20:37   At supper comes Mr. Pembleton, and after supper we up to our dancing room and there danced three or four country dances.

1663-05-06 13:28   The old seamen tell us that they have had eleven hogsheads of oyle out of the tongue of a whale.

1663-05-06 13:23   The old seamen have catched in Greenland in fishing whales with the iron grapnells that had been struck into their bodies covered with fat.

1663-05-06 12:32   The Parliament will make mad work; they will render men incapable of military or civil employment that have borne arms in the late troubles.

1663-05-05 23:06   It fell a-thundering and lightening, the greatest flashes enlightening the whole body of the yard, that ever I saw in my life.

1663-05-05 20:39   I made it my business to enquire of Sir W. Warren what way there is for a man bred like me to come to understand anything of trade.

1663-05-05 18:29   Deane of Woolwich showed me the use of a little sliding ruler, less than that I bought the other day, which is the same, but more portable.

1663-05-05 09:42   With Sir J. Minnes, he telling many old stories of the Navy, and of the state of the Navy at the beginning of the late troubles.

1663-05-04 18:06   I do suspect that all is not kind between the King and the Duke, and that the King’s fondness to the little Duke do occasion it.

1663-05-04 15:44   Mr. Coventry and the King talked of building a new yacht, which the King is resolved to have built out of his privy purse.

1663-05-04 10:28   What with the dancing-master’s desire and my wife’s importunity, I was obliged to give him entry-money 10s, and am become his scholler.

1663-05-04 10:07   The dancing-master came, whom, seeing him instructing my wife, when he had done with her, he would needs have me try the steps of a coranto.

1663-05-04 08:26   Looking over my wardrobe against summer, and laying things in order to send to my brother to alter.

1663-05-03 22:10   I had rather talk with any body than my wife, by which she is jealous of my freedom with Ashwell, which I must avoid giving occasion of.

1663-05-03 22:07   My wife and I having a falling out because I would not leave her and Ashwell to go up and talk with her alone upon something she has to say.

1663-05-03 16:10   I to teach Ashwell the grounds of time and other things on the tryangle, and made her take out a Psalm well, she having a good ear and hand.

1663-05-02 17:27   Up to Sir W. Pen to drink a glass of bad syder in his new far low dining room, which is very noble.

1663-05-02 07:46   I to angry words with my wife about neglecting the keeping of the house clean, I calling her beggar, and she me pricklouse, which vexed me.

1663-05-02 06:54   Being weary last night, I slept till almost seven o’clock, a thing I have not done many a day.

1663-05-01 21:29   I went to hear Mrs. Turner’s daughter play on the harpsicon; but, Lord! it was enough to make any man sick; yet I was forced to commend her.

1663-05-01 20:06   In Leadenhall Street, there was morris-dancing which I have not seen a great while.

1663-05-01 18:30   I saw few good faces that there were choked up with the many bad ones, there being people of all sorts in coaches there, to some thousands.

1663-05-01 17:42   Seeing the King’s riders showing tricks with their managed horses, which were very strange, my stone-horse was very troublesome.

1663-05-01 16:58   I saw my father out of London, at the end of Bishopsgate Street, and so I turned and rode through the fields, towards Hide Park.

1663-05-01 15:47   I advised my father to living within the compass of 50l. a year, and all in such kind words as not only made them but myself to weep.

1663-05-01 10:22   Captain Grove sent me a side of pork, which was the oddest present that was ever made any man; but the fellow do it in kindness.
