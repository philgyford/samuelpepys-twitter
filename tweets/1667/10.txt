1667-10-16 17:42   To the Duke of York’s house; and I was vexed to see Young (who is but a bad actor at best) act Macbeth in the room of Betterton, who, poor man! is sick: but, Lord! what a prejudice it wrought in me against the whole play, and everybody else agreed in disliking this fellow.

1667-10-16 10:34 r The King did give the Duke of York a sound reprimand; told him that he had lived with him with more kindness than ever any brother King lived with a brother, and that he lived as much like a monarch as himself, but advised him not to cross him in his designs about the Chancellor.

1667-10-16 10:30   The Commons and Lords have concurred, and delivered the King their thanks, among other things, for his removal of the Chancellor; who took their thanks very well, and, among other things, promised them never, in any degree, to entertain the Chancellor any employment again.

1667-10-15 17:53 r But here, before the play begun, my wife begun to complain to me of Willet’s confidence in sitting cheek by jowl by us, which was a poor thing; but I perceive she is already jealous of my kindness to her, so that I begin to fear this girl is not likely to stay long with us.

1667-10-15 17:48   My wife and I and Willet to the Duke of York’s house, where, after long stay, the King and Duke of York come, and there saw “The Coffee-house,” the most ridiculous, insipid play that ever I saw in my life, and glad we were that Betterton had no part in it.

1667-10-15 09:03   Up, and to the office, where, Sir W. Pen being ill of the gout, we all of us met there in his parlour and did the business of the office, our greatest business now being to manage the pay of the ships in order and with speed to satisfy the Commissioners of the Treasury.

1667-10-14 18:20   To the Duke of York’s House, and there went in for nothing into the pit, at the last act, to see Sir Martin Marrall, and met my wife, and my brother, and W. Hewer and Willett, and carried them home, being pleased with the humour of the play, almost above all that ever I saw.

1667-10-14 14:10   To Westminster Hall, and there walked with Mr. Scowen, who tells me that it is at last carried in the House that the thanks shall be given to the King — among other things, particularly for the removal of my Lord Chancellor.

1667-10-14 13:41   To my Lord Crew, to see him after my coming out of the country, and he seems satisfied with some steps they have made in my absence towards my Lord Sandwich’s relief for money: and so I have no more to do, nor will trouble myself more about it till they send for me.

1667-10-14 10:15 r And his mother is one that encourages him in it, so that they are at this time upon very bad terms one with another, and desires that I would take a time to advise him and tell him what it becomes him to do, which office I am glad of, for some ends of my own also con sa fille.

1667-10-14 10:10   I to Mrs. Martin’s, where by appointment comes to me Mrs. Howlett, which I was afraid was to have told me something of my freedom with her daughter, but it was not so, but only to complain to me of her son-in-law, how he abuses and makes a slave of her.

1667-10-13 20:37   So in a-doors and supped with my wife and brother, W. Hewer, and Willett, and so evened with W. Hewer for my expenses upon the road this last journey, and do think that the whole journey will cost me little less than 18l. or 20l., one way or other.

1667-10-13 16:02   By water again to White Hall, and thence only walked to Mrs. Martin’s, and there sat with her and her sister and Borroughs and did tocar la prima, and there drank and talked and away by water home.

1667-10-13 09:10   The Duke of York did call me to him, and tell me that he had spoke to the King, and that the King had granted me the ship I asked for; and did, moreover, say that he was mightily satisfied with my service, and that he would be willing to do anything that was in his power for me.

1667-10-12 19:40   Sir W. Pen says that Lady Batten and her children-in-law are all broke in pieces, and that there is but 800l. found in the world, of money; and is in great doubt what we shall do towards the doing ourselves right with them, about the prize-money.

1667-10-12 18:23 r The King declared by my Lord Keeper how many acts he had done since he saw them; among others, disbanding the army, and putting all Papists out of employment, and displacing persons that had managed their business ill. The Parliament is mightily pleased with the King’s speech.

1667-10-12 18:20   I hear by Mr. Pierce the surgeon; and then by Mr. Lewes, and also by Mr. Hater, that the King did make the Parliament a very kind speech, promising them to leave all to them to do, and call to account what and whom they pleased.

1667-10-12 17:30   At home we find that Sir W. Batten’s burial was today carried from hence, with a hundred or two of coaches, to Walthamstow, and there buried.

1667-10-12 17:12 r Home, where I find all well; and did bring my gold, to my heart’s content, safe home, having not this day carried it in a basket, but in our hands: the girl took care of one, and my wife another bag, and I the rest, I being afraid of the bottom of the coach lest it should break.

1667-10-11 20:38 r We sat down to talk, and were very pleasant, satisfying myself, among other things, from John Bowles, in some terms of hunting, and about deere, bucks, and does. And so anon to supper, and very merry we were, and a good supper.

1667-10-11 17:00 r At Stevenage we come well before night, and all sat, and there with great care I got the gold up to the chamber, my wife carrying one bag, and the girl another, and W. Hewer the rest in the basket, and set it all under a bed in our chamber.

1667-10-11 16:16 r My gold I put into a basket, and set under one of the seats; and so my work every quarter of an hour was to look to see whether all was well; and I did ride in great fear all the day, but it was a pleasant day, and good company, and I mightily contented.

1667-10-11 10:20 r My sister cried at my going; but whether it was at her unwillingness for my going, or any unkindness of my wife’s, or no, I know not; but, God forgive me! I take her to be so cunning and ill-natured, that I have no great love for her.

1667-10-11 10:05 r We to breakfast, and then took coach, my wife and I, and Willet, and W. Hewer, and Murford and John Bowles (whom my Lady lent me), and my brother John on horseback; and with these four I thought myself pretty safe.

1667-10-11 09:12 r It gives me some kind of content to remember how painful it is sometimes to keep money, as well as to get it, and how doubtful I was how to keep it all night, and how to secure it to London: and so got all my gold put up in bags.

1667-10-11 09:10 r I do leave my father to make a second examination of the dirt, which he promises he will do, and, poor man, is mightily troubled for this accident, but I declared myself very well satisfied, and so indeed I am.

1667-10-11 09:05 r To our great content, did with much trouble (and by the time we emptied several pails and could not find one), we did make the last night’s forty-five up seventy-nine: so that we are come to about twenty or thirty of what I think the true number should be.

1667-10-11 07:15 r W. Hewer and I, with pails and a sieve, did lock ourselves into the garden, and there gather all the earth about the place into pails, and then sift those pails in one of the summer-houses, just as they do for dyamonds in other parts of the world.

1667-10-11 01:52 r So W. Hewer and I out again about midnight, for it was now grown so late, and there by candlelight did make shift to gather forty-five pieces more. And so in, and to cleanse them.

1667-10-10 23:47 r Considering that the neighbour’s house was so near that we could not suppose we could speak one to another in the garden at the place where the gold lay, I feared that they might in the night come and gather some pieces and prevent us the next morning.

1667-10-10 23:24 r W. Hewer and I did, with several pails of water and basins, at last wash the dirt off of the pieces, and parted the pieces and the dirt; and by a note which I had of the value of the whole in my pocket, do find that there was short above a hundred pieces, which did make me mad.

1667-10-10 21:45 r I perceive the earth was got among the gold, and wet, so that the bags were all rotten, and all the notes, that I could not tell what in the world to say to it, not knowing how to judge what was wanting: which, all put together, did make me mad.

1667-10-10 21:33 r But, good God! to see how sillily they did it, not half a foot under ground, and in the sight of the world from a hundred places, if any body by accident were near hand, and within sight of a neighbour’s window, and their hearing also, being close by.

1667-10-10 21:12 r At last to fear that it was gone but by and by poking with a spit, we found it, and then begun with a spudd to lift up the ground.

1667-10-10 20:55 r But, Lord! what a tosse I was for some time in, that they could not justly tell where it was; that I begun heartily to sweat, and be angry, that they should not agree better upon the place.

1667-10-10 20:15 r My father and I, with a dark lantern; it being now night, into the garden with my wife, and there went about our great work to dig up my gold.

1667-10-10 16:37 r They repeating a whole ode without book out of Horace, and did give me a very good account of any thing almost, and did make me very readily very good Latin, and did give me good account of their Greek grammar, beyond all possible expectation.

1667-10-10 16:34 r I spent alone with my Lady the most of the afternoon, and anon the two twins were sent for from school, to come to see me, and I took them into the garden, and there, did examine them, and do find them so well advanced in their learning, that I was amazed at it.

1667-10-10 13:57 r Went all of us, my sister and brother, and W. Hewer, to dinner to Hinchingbroke, where we had a good plain country dinner, but most kindly used; and here dined the Minister of Brampton and his wife, who is reported a very good, but poor man.

1667-10-10 10:30 r Then walked round about our Greene, to see whether, in case I cannot buy out my uncle Thomas and his son’s right in this house, that I can buy another place as good thereabouts to build on, and I do not see that I can.

1667-10-10 08:10 r Up to walk up and down the garden with my father, to talk of all our concernments: about a husband for my sister, whereof there is at present no appearance; then for my brother; and resolve he shall stay here this winter, and then I will either send him to Cambridge for a year.

1667-10-10 07:03   Waked with great pain of the collique, by cold taken yesterday, I believe, with going up and down in my shirt, but with rubbing my belly, keeping of it warm, I did at last come to some ease, and rose.

1667-10-09 22:05 r I perceive there was some great falling out when my wife was here last, but the reason I have no mind to enquire after, for vexing myself, being desirous to pass my time with as much mirth as I can while I am abroad.

1667-10-09 22:00 r We all to bed, only I a little troubled that my father tells me that he is troubled that my wife shows my sister no countenance, and, him but very little, but is as a stranger in the house; and I do observe she do carry herself very high.

1667-10-09 19:28 r We took leave with all possible kindness, and so home, and there Mr. Shepley staid with us and supped, and full of good country discourse.

1667-10-09 17:51 r I do find, by my Lady, that they are reduced to great straits for money, having been forced to sell her plate, 8 or 900l. worth; and she is now going to sell a suit of her best hangings, of which I could almost wish to buy a piece or two, if the pieces will be broke.

1667-10-09 17:13 r By and by my wife comes with Willet, my wife in her velvett vest, which is mighty fine, and becomes her exceedingly. I am pleased with my Lady Paulina and Anne, who both are grown very proper ladies, and handsome enough.

1667-10-09 16:44 r I walked up to Hinchingbroke, where my Lady expected me; and there spent all the afternoon with her: the same most excellent, good, discreet lady that ever she was; and is mightily pleased with the lady that is like to be her son Hinchingbroke’s wife which I am mightily glad of.

1667-10-09 12:50 r I bless God that I am like to have such a pretty place to retire to: and I did walk with my father without doors, and do find a very convenient way of laying out money there in building, which will make a very good seat, and the place deserves it, I think, very well.

1667-10-09 12:40 r Up and down to see the garden with my father, and the house, and do altogether find it very pretty; especially the little parlour and the summerhouses in the garden, only the wall do want greens upon it, and the house is too low-roofed.

1667-10-09 12:10 r And so away for Huntingdon mightily pleased all along the road to remember old stories; and come to Brampton at about noon, and there find my father and sister and brother all well and here laid up our things.

1667-10-09 08:05 r And the town musique did also come and play: but, Lord! what sad music they made! However, I was pleased with them, being all of us in very good humour, and so through the town, and observed at our College of Magdalene the posts new painted.

1667-10-09 07:30   Up, and got ready, and eat our breakfast; and then took coach: and the poor, as they did yesterday, did stand at the coach to have something given them, as they do to all great persons; and I did give them something.

1667-10-08 21:57 r After supper, to cards; and then to bed, lying, I in one bed, and my wife and girl in another, in the same room, and very merry talking together, and mightily pleased both of us with the girl.

1667-10-08 17:30 r I took my wife, and W. Hewer, and Willet and showed them Trinity College and St. John’s Library, and went to King’s College Chapel, to see the outside of it only; and so to our inne, and with much pleasure did this, they walking in their pretty morning gowns, very handsome.

1667-10-08 16:15 r Here we parted with Lowther and his friends, and away to Cambridge, it being foul, rainy weather, and there did take up at the Rose, for the sake of Mrs. Dorothy Drawwater, the vintner’s daughter, which is mentioned in the play of Sir Martin Marrall.

1667-10-08 14:07 r And then to the garden, and there eat many grapes, and took some with us and so away thence, exceeding well satisfied, though not to that degree that, by my old esteem of the house, I ought and did expect to have done, the situation of it not pleasing me.

1667-10-08 13:30 r Only the gallery is good, and, above all things, the cellars, where we went down and drank of much good liquor; and indeed the cellars are fine: and here my wife and I did sing to my great content.

1667-10-08 13:18 r Though the figure of the house without be very extraordinary good, yet the stayre-case is exceeding poor; and a great many pictures, and not one good one in the house but one of Harry the Eighth, done by Holben; and not one good suit of hangings in all the house.

1667-10-08 12:30 r They went with us to Audley-End, and did go along with us all over the house and garden: and mighty merry we were. The house indeed do appear very fine, but not so fine as it hath heretofore to me; particularly the ceilings are not so good as I always took them to be.

1667-10-08 10:05 r At last, rose, and up, and broke our fast, and then took coach, and away, and at Newport did call on Mr. Lowther, and he and his friend, and the master of the house, their friend, where they were, a gentleman, did presently get a-horseback and overtook us.

1667-10-08 06:50   Up pretty betimes, though not so soon as we intended, by reason of Murford’s not rising, and then not knowing how to open our door, which, and some other pleasant simplicities of the fellow, did give occasion to us to call him Sir Martin Marrall.

1667-10-07 21:50 r And so to bed, my wife and I in one bed, and the girl in another, in the same room, and lay very well, but there was so much tearing company in the house, that we could not see my landlady; so I had no opportunity of renewing my old acquaintance with her.

1667-10-07 19:21 r I fell to write my letter to my Lord Sandwich, which I could not finish before my coming from London; so did finish it to my good content, telling him the present state of all matters, and did get a man to promise to carry it tomorrow morning, to be there, at my house, by noon.

1667-10-07 16:35 r It was the woman that was great with my cozen Barnston of Cottenham, and did use to sing to him and did teach me “Full forty times over” a very lewd song. A woman they are well acquainted with, and is here what she was at Cambridge, and all the good fellows come hither.

1667-10-07 16:30 r We parted, we going before them, my wife and girl and I telling tales, and singing, and before night come to Bishop Stafford, where Lowther and his friend did meet us again and carried us to the Raynedeere, where Mrs. Aynsworth, whom I knew better than they think for, do live.

1667-10-07 12:04 r So we to Enfield, and there bayted, it being but a foul, bad day, and there Lowther and Mr. Burford, an acquaintance of his, did overtake us, and there drank and eat together.

1667-10-07 10:30 r We set out, and so out at Allgate, and so to the Green Man, and so on to Enfield, in our way seeing Mr. Lowther and his lady in a coach, going to Walthamstow; and he told us that he would overtake us at night, he being to go that way.

1667-10-07 06:15   Up betimes, and did do several things towards the settling all matters both of house and office in order for my journey this day, and did leave my chief care, and the key of my closet, with Mr. Hater, with directions what papers to secure, in case of fire or other accident.

1667-10-06 20:43   Home to supper, where Pelling comes and sits with me, and there tells us how old Mr. Batelier is dead this last night in the night, going to bed well, which I am mightily troubled for, he being a good man.

1667-10-06 10:48   To White Hall, and there met Sir W. Coventry, and discoursed with him, and then with my Lord Bruncker, and many others, to end my matters in order to my going into the country tomorrow for five or six days, which I have not done for above three years.

1667-10-06 08:04   Up, and dressed myself, and so walked out with the boy to Smithfield to Cow Lane, to Lincolne’s, and there spoke with him, and agreed upon the hour tomorrow, to set out towards Brampton; but vexed that he is not likely to go himself, but sends another for him.

1667-10-05 15:24 r But to see how Nell cursed, for having so few people in the pit, was pretty; the other house carrying away all the people at the new play, and is said, now-a-days, to have generally most company, as being better players.

1667-10-05 15:09 r But, Lord! to see how they were painted would make a man mad, and did make me loath them; and what base company of men comes among them, and how lewdly they talk! and how poor the men are in clothes and yet what a show they make on the stage by candle-light, is very observable.

1667-10-05 15:03 r And so walked all up and down the house above, and then below into the scene-room, and there sat down, and she gave us fruit and here I read the Qu’s to Knepp, while she answered me, through all her part of “Flora’s Figary’s,” which was acted today.

1667-10-05 14:30   To the Duke of York’s playhouse, but the house so full, it being a new play, “The Coffee House,” that we could not get in, and so to the King’s house: and there met with Knepp and she took us up into the tireing-rooms: and to the women’s shift, where Nell was dressing herself.

1667-10-05 12:10   Sir G. Carteret walked with me and concluded not to concern or have any advice made to Sir W. Coventry, in behalf of my Lord Sandwich’s business; I do think they are all mad, that they will judge Sir W. Coventry an enemy, when he is indeed no such man to any body.

1667-10-05 11:03   Much surprized with the news of the death of Sir W. Batten, who died this morning, having been but two days sick. Sir W. Pen and I did dispatch a letter this morning, to recommend Colonel Middleton, who we think a most honest and understanding man, and fit for that place.

1667-10-04 20:02   Word is brought me that Sir W. Batten is so ill, that it is believed he cannot live till tomorrow, which troubles me and my wife mightily, partly out of kindness, he being a good neighbour and partly because of the money he owes me, upon our bargain of the late prize.

1667-10-04 17:30   To my Lord Crew’s, and there did stay with him an hour till almost night, discoursing about the ill state of my Lord Sandwich, that he can neither be got to be called home, nor money got to maintain him there; which will ruin his family.

1667-10-04 15:10   I to Westminster, to Mrs. Martin’s lodging, whither I sent for her, and there hear that her husband is come from sea, which is sooner than I expected; and here I staid and drank, and so did tocar ella and away, and so by coach to my tailor’s.

1667-10-03 18:40   We to my tailor’s and, the coachman desiring to go home to change his horses, we went with him into a nasty end of St. Giles’s and went into a nasty room, where he hath a wife and child, and staid, it growing dark, and I angry thereat, till he shifted his horses, and home apace.

1667-10-03 11:16 r The woman is a very wise woman, and is very plain in telling me how her plate and jewels are at pawne for money, and how they are forced to live beyond their estate, and do get nothing by his being a courtier. The lady I pity, and her family.

1667-10-03 11:12   I to my Lady Peterboroughlking about her husband’s pension, and how she hath got an order for its being paid again; though, I believe, for all that order, it will hardly be; but of that I said nothing; but her design is to get it paid again.

1667-10-03 09:50   Sir W. Coventry took me into the gallery, and walked with me an hour, discoursing of Navy business, and with much kindness to, and confidence in, me still; which I must endeavour to preserve, and will do.

1667-10-03 07:58   Up, and going out of doors, I understand that Sir W. Batten is gone to bed on a sudden again this morning, being struck very ill, and I confess I have observed him for these last two months to look very ill and to look worse and worse.

1667-10-02 17:34   By coach to the New Exchange, and there met my wife and girl, and took them to the King’s house to see “The Traytour,” which still I like as a very good play.

1667-10-02 12:30   This morning come to me Mr. Gawden about business, with his gold chain about his neck, as being Sheriffe of the City this year.

1667-10-01 22:05   Late in the dark round by the wall home by coach, and there to sing and sup with my wife, and look upon our pretty girl, and so to bed.

1667-10-01 19:50 r Here was a great press of people; but I did not see many pleased with it, only the instrumental music he had brought by practice to play very just.

1667-10-01 19:16 r But, God forgive me! I never was so little pleased with a concert of music in my life. The manner of setting of words and repeating them out of order, and that with a number of voices, makes me sick, the whole design of vocall music being lost by it.

1667-10-01 19:05   To White Hall, and there in the Boarded-gallery did hear the music with which the King is presented this night by Monsieur Grebus, the master of his music; both instrumental — I think twenty-four violins — and vocall; an English song upon Peace.

1667-10-01 15:40   Took coach and to my wife, who was gone before into the Strand, there to buy a nightgown, where I found her in a shop with her pretty girl, and having bought it away home.

1667-10-01 11:45   All the morning busy at the office, pleased mightily with my girl that we have got to wait on my wife.
