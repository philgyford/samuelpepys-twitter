1667-10-31 19:00 r Colonel Reames did tell me of a fellow last night did say that he did see one of the Commissioners bring in three wagon-loads of prize-goods into Greenwich one night; but that the House did take no notice of it; but this is me, and I must expect to be called to account.

1667-10-31 18:40 r My cozen Pepys tells me that he thanks God he never knew what it was to be tempted to be a knave in his life; till he did come into the House of Commons, where there is nothing done but by passion, and faction, and private interest.

1667-10-31 18:10 r Colonel Reames and cozen Roger Pepys do tell me how the Duke of Albemarle and the Prince have laid blame on a great many and on our Office in general; and particularly for want of provision, wherein I shall come to be questioned again in that business myself which do trouble me.

1667-10-31 17:18 r So as the House this day have, I think, ordered Commissioner Pett to the Tower again, or something like it; so that the poor man is likely to be overthrown, I doubt, right or wrong, so infinite fond they are of any thing the Duke of Albemarle says or writes to them!

1667-10-31 16:03   I to Westminster and there at the lobby do hear by Commissioner Pett, to my great amazement, that he is in worse condition than before, by the coming in of the Duke of Albemarle’s and Prince Rupert’s Narratives’ this day; wherein the former do most severely lay matters upon him.

1667-10-31 15:20   I by water, calling at Michell’s, and saw and once kissed su wife, but I do think that he is jealous of her, and so she dares not stand out of his sight; so could not do more.

1667-10-30 22:18   When I come home I did find my wife, and Betty Turner, the two Mercers, and Mrs. Parker, an ugly lass, but yet dances well, and speaks the best of them, and W. Batelier, and Pembleton dancing; and here I danced with them, and had a good supper, and as merry as I could be.

1667-10-30 18:48 r But, Lord! to see that we should be brought to justify ourselves in a thing of necessity and profit to the King, and of no profit or convenience to us, but the contrary.

1667-10-30 18:10 r So my Lord Bruncker was called in, and they could fasten nothing on him that I could see, nor indeed was there any proper matter for blame.

1667-10-30 16:49   The Committee fell to the business of tickets, and I did give them the best answer I could, but had not scope to do it in the methodical manner which I had prepared myself for, but they did ask a great many broken rude questions about it.

1667-10-30 13:20   With Sir W. Pen to White Hall, where we did a very little business with the Duke of York at our usual meeting, only I perceive that he do leave all of us, as the King do those about him, to stand and fall by ourselves.

1667-10-29 16:50   Bruncker and I to the King’s House, thinking to have gone into a box above, for fear of being seen, the King being there, but the play being 3 acts done we would not give 4s., and so away and parted.

1667-10-29 14:48   At the office, my Lord Bruncker and I close together, never stirring, making up a report for the Committee about the business of discharging men by ticket, which it seems the House is mighty earnest in, but is a foolery in itself.

1667-10-28 17:20   After dinner, my wife, and Mercer, who grows fat, and Willett, and I, to the King’s house, and there saw “The Committee,” a play I like well.

1667-10-28 10:02 r But that he thinks that he is not liable to any hurt they can fasten on him for anything, he is so well armed to justify himself in every thing, unless in the old business of selling places, when he says every body did.

1667-10-28 10:00   Sir W. Coventry owns that he is, at this day, the chief person aymed at by the Parliament – that is, by the friends of my Lord Chancellor, and also by the Duke of Albemarle – by reason of his unhappy shewing of the Duke of Albemarle’s letter, the other day, in the House.

1667-10-27 15:24 r I desired Mr. Uthwayte to take a strict inventory of her, that I might not be cheated by the master nor the company, when they come to understand that the vessel is gone away, which he hath promised me.

1667-10-27 15:05   I down to Deptford, the first time that I went to look upon “The Maybolt,” which the King hath given me, and there she is; and I did meet with Mr. Uthwayte, who do tell me that there are new sails ordered to be delivered her, and a cable, which I did not speak of at all to him.

1667-10-27 11:57   To my office, there, with W. Hewer, to dictate a long letter to the Duke of York, about the bad state of the office, it being a work I do think fit for the office to do, though it be to no purpose but for their vindication in these bad times.

1667-10-26 15:01 r After much mirth and good company at dinner, I to the office and left them, and Pendleton also, who come in to see my wife and talk of dancing.

1667-10-26 14:20 r Mrs. Pierce is still very pretty, but paints red on her face, which makes me hate her, that I thank God I take no pleasure in her at all more.

1667-10-26 13:38 r Nell answered then, “I was but one man’s whore, though I was brought up in a bawdy-house to fill strong waters to the guests; and you are a whore to three or four, though a Presbyter’s praying daughter!” which was very pretty.

1667-10-26 13:36   Mrs. Pierce tells me that the two Marshalls at the King’s house are Stephen Marshalls, the great Presbyterian’s, daughters: and that Nelly and Beck Marshall, falling out the other day, the latter called the other my Lord Buckhurst’s whore.

1667-10-25 20:18 r But it seems a witness has come in tonight, C. Millett, who do declare that he did deliver a message from the Duke of Albemarle time enough for him to carry up “The Charles,” and he neglected it, which will stick very hard, it seems, on him.

1667-10-25 20:12 r At last they broke up, and we had our commissions again, and I do hear how Birch is the high man that do examine and trouble every body with his questions, and they say that he do labour all he can to clear Pett.

1667-10-25 18:10 r Spragg was in with them all the afternoon, and hath much fault laid on him for a man that minded his pleasure, and little else of his whole charge.

1667-10-25 15:40 r With Sir W. Pen to the Parliament Committee and there we all met and did show, my Lord Bruncker and I, our commissions under the Great Seal in behalf of all the rest, to shew them our duties, and there I had no more matters asked me, but were bid to withdraw, and did there wait.

1667-10-25 14:03   All the morning close, till I had not time to eat my dinner, to make our answer ready for the Parliament this afternoon, to show how Commissioner Pett was singly concerned in the executing of all orders from Chatham, and that we did properly lodge all orders with him.

1667-10-24 16:36 r Here we also saw again the two fat children come out of Ireland, and a brother and sister of theirs now come, which are of little ordinary growth. But, Lord! how strange it is to observe the difference between the same children, come out of the same little woman’s belly!

1667-10-24 16:01 r It at first was a mystery to me that I should hear a whole concert of chords together at the end of a pause, but he showed me that it was only when the last notes were 5ths or 3rds, one to another, and then their sounds like an Echo.

1667-10-24 15:40   To Charing Cross and we in to see a Frenchman, at the house where my wife’s father last lodged, one Monsieur Prin, play on the trump-marine, which he do beyond belief; and, the truth is, it do so far outdo a trumpet as nothing more.

1667-10-24 14:36   To the Duke of York’s playhouse; but there Betterton not being yet well, we would not stay, though since I hear that Smith do act his part in “The Villaine,” which was then acted, as well or better than he, which I do not believe.

1667-10-23 21:00   I know not how, the blockhead Albemarle hath strange luck to be loved, though he be, and every man must know it, the heaviest man in the world, but stout and honest to his country.

1667-10-23 17:33   To the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Black Prince” again: which is now mightily bettered by that long letter being printed, and so delivered to every body at their going in, and some short reference made to it in heart in the play.

1667-10-23 14:42 r Sir W. Coventry says the House was well satisfied with my Report yesterday; and so several others told me in the Hall that my Report was very good and satisfactory, and that I have got advantage by it in the House: I pray God it may prove so!

1667-10-23 14:20   In Westminster Hall, met with Sir W. Coventry, who is in pain to defend himself in the business of tickets, it being said that the paying of the ships at Chatham by ticket was by his direction, and he hath wrote to me to find his letters, and shew them him, but I find none.

1667-10-23 11:50 r I got in, the King being newly gone; and there find the bottom of the first pillar laid. And here was a shed set up, and hung with tapestry, and a canopy of state, and some good victuals and wine, for the King, who, it seems, did it.

1667-10-23 10:30   Sir W. Pen and I back into London; and there saw the King, with his kettle-drums and trumpets, going to the Exchange, to lay the first stone of the first pillar of the new building of the Exchange.

1667-10-22 18:10 r At last, the House dismissed us, and shortly after did adjourne the debate: and my cozen Pepys did come out and joy me in my acquitting myself so well, and so did several others, which makes me a little proud, but yet not secure.

1667-10-22 17:30 r But, Lord! what a tumultuous thing this Committee is, for all the reputation they have of a great council, is a strange consideration; there being as impertinent questions, and as disorderly proposed, as any man could make.

1667-10-22 17:15 r I had a chair brought me to lean my books upon: and so did give them such an account, in a series of the whole business that had passed the Office touching the matter, and so answered all questions given me about it.

1667-10-22 15:02 r We come to the Parliament-door, and there, after a little waiting till the Committee was sat, we were, the House being very full, called in.

1667-10-22 14:20 r All in my Lord Bruncker’s coach, that is to say, Bruncker, W. Pen, T. Harvy, and myself, talking of the other great matter with which they charge us, that is, of discharging men by ticket, in order to our defence in case that should be asked.

1667-10-22 13:48 r All of us all the morning close, till almost two o’clock, collecting all we had to say and had done from the beginning, touching the safety of the River Medway and Chatham. And, having done this, and put it into order, we away.

1667-10-22 05:55 r I slept pretty well till about four o’clock, and from that time could not, but my thoughts running on speeches to the Parliament to excuse myself from the blame which by other men’s negligence will ’light, it may be, upon the office.

1667-10-21 22:13 r I did get a list of the fourteen miscarriages which are already before the Committee to be examined; wherein, besides two or three that will concern this Office much, there are those of the prizes, and that of Bergen, and not following the Dutch ships, against my Lord Sandwich.

1667-10-21 21:32 r I had a little pleasure in talking with these, but my head and heart full of thoughts between hope and fear and doubts what will become of us and me particularly against a furious Parliament.

1667-10-21 21:14 r I took coach (little Michell being with me, whom I took with me from Westminster Hall), and setting him down in Gracious street home myself, where I find my wife and the two Mercers and Willett and W. Batelier have been dancing, but without a fidler.

1667-10-21 20:37 r My cozen Pepys comes out to me, and bids me prepare to answer to every thing; for they do seem to lodge the business of Chatham upon the Commissioners of the Navy, and they are resolved to lay the fault heavy somewhere, and to punish it: and prays me to prepare to save myself.

1667-10-21 19:28 r At last was called in and told that the least they expected from us Mr Wren had promised them, and bade me to bring all my fellow-officers thitherto attend them tomorrow afternoon. Sir Robert Brookes in the chair: methinks a sorry fellow to be there; and yet he speaks very well.

1667-10-21 19:04 r I away to Westminster, and up to the Parliament-house, and there did wait with great patience, till seven at night, to be called in to the Committee, who sat all this afternoon, examining the business of Chatham.

1667-10-21 15:10 r I walked to Sir G. Carteret’s, and there dined with him and several Parliament-men, who, I perceive, do all look upon it as a thing certain that the Parliament will enquire into every thing, and will be very severe where they can find any fault.

1667-10-21 10:02   To Westminster Hall and there walked a little, finding the Parliament likely to be busy all this morning about the business of Mr. Bruncker for advising Cox and Harman to shorten sail when they were in pursuit of the Dutch after the first great victory.

1667-10-20 21:27   Pelling tells me that my Lady Duchesse Albemarle did talk of our Office; and that she believed that I was safe, and had done well; and so, I thank God! I hear every body speaks of me; and I think, without vanity, I may expect to be profited rather than injured by this inquiry.

1667-10-20 20:32   I am glad to hear that in the world I am as kindly spoke of as any body; for, for aught I see, there is bloody work like to be, Sir W. Coventry having been forced to produce a letter in Parliament.

1667-10-20 19:04   Captain O’Bryan and I to talk of the Parliament; and he tells me that the business of the Duke of York’s slackening sail in the first fight, at the beginning of the war, is brought into question, and Sir W. Pen and Captain Cox are to appear tomorrow about it.

1667-10-20 18:30   Mr. Deane dines with me, and he and I spent all the day till it was dark in discourse of business of the Navy and the ground of the many miscarriages, wherein he do inform me in many more than I knew, and I had desired him to put them in writing, and many they are and good ones.

1667-10-20 09:50   Is brought to me an order for the presenting the Committee of Parliament tomorrow with a list of the commanders and ships’ names of all the fleets set out since the war, and particularly of those ships which were divided from the fleet with Prince Rupert.

1667-10-19 18:04 r I home by coach, and could not forbear laughing almost all the way home at the ridiculousness of the letter, and the more because my wife was angry with me, and the world, for laughing, because the King was there, though she cannot defend the length of the letter.

1667-10-19 17:15 r Towards the end he comes to discover the chief of the plot by the reading of a long letter, which was so long that they frequently begun to laugh, and to hiss twenty times, that, had it not been for the King’s being there, they had certainly hissed it off the stage.

1667-10-19 16:40 r But, as to the contrivance, and all that was witty, was almost the same that had been in his two former plays of “Henry the 5th” and “Mustapha,” and the same points and turns of wit in both, and in this very same play often repeated, but in excellent language.

1667-10-19 16:02 r The house infinite full, and the King and Duke of York was there. By and by the play begun, and in it nothing particular but a very fine dance for variety of figures, but a little too long.

1667-10-19 14:35 r In the same box come, behind me, my Lord Barkeley and his lady; but I did not turn my face to them to be known, so that I was excused from giving them my seat; and this pleasure I had, that from this place the scenes do appear very fine indeed, and much better than in the pit.

1667-10-19 14:08   Full of my desire of seeing my Lord Orrery’s play at the King’s house, “The Black Prince,” the first time it is acted; though we come by two o’clock, there was no room in the pit, but we were forced to go into one of the upper boxes, which is the first time I ever sat in a box.

1667-10-18 22:57   To my chamber, telling over all my gold, and putting it into proper bags and my iron chest, being glad with my heart to see so much of it here again, but cannot yet tell certainly how much I have lost by Gibson in his journey, and my father’s burying of it in the dirt.

1667-10-18 13:37   Creed tells me that Sir Robert Brookes is the man that did mention the business in Parliament yesterday about my Lord Sandwich, but that it was seconded by nobody, but the matter will fall before the Committee for miscarriages.

1667-10-18 10:53 r Turlington’s daughter, he being out of the way, do advise me two very young sights, as that that will help me most, and promises me great ease from them, and I will try them.

1667-10-18 10:47   To several places to buy a hat, and books, and neckcloths, and several errands I did before I got home, and, among others, bought me two new pair of spectacles of Turlington, who, it seems, is famous for them.

1667-10-17 18:58   Sir W. Pen and I out to Mile End Green, and there drank a cup of Byde’s ale, and so talking about the proceedings of Parliament, and how little a thing the King is become to be forced to suffer it, though I declare my being satisfied that things should be enquired into.

1667-10-17 16:30   My Lord Anglesey tells us that the House of Commons have this morning run into the inquiry in many things; as, the sale of Dunkirke, the dividing of the fleet the last year, the business of the prizes with my Lord Sandwich, and many other things.

1667-10-17 13:55 r When the wine come I begun to be merry, but it was an odd, strange thing to observe of Mr. Andrews what a fancy he hath to raw meat, that he eats it with no pleasure unless the blood run about his chops, which it did now by a leg of mutton that was not above half boiled.

1667-10-17 13:42   To dinner, where Mr. John Andrews and his wife come and dined, and merry we were, only I out of humour part of the dinner, by reason that my people had forgot to get wine ready, I having none in my house, by which we were fain to stay a great while, while some could be fetched.

1667-10-17 09:32 r And here do see what creatures widows are in weeping for their husbands, and then presently leaving off; but I cannot wonder at it, the cares of the world taking place of all other passions.

1667-10-17 09:26 r My Lady Batten told me her condition, which is good enough, being sole executrix, to the disappointment of all her husband’s children, and prayed my friendship about the accounts of the prizes, which I promised her.

1667-10-17 09:07   Being sent for by my Lady Batten, I to her, and there she found fault with my not seeing her since her being a widow, which I excused as well as I could, though it is a fault, but it is my nature not to be forward in visits.

1667-10-16 17:42   To the Duke of York’s house; and I was vexed to see Young (who is but a bad actor at best) act Macbeth in the room of Betterton, who, poor man! is sick: but, Lord! what a prejudice it wrought in me against the whole play, and everybody else agreed in disliking this fellow.

1667-10-16 10:34 r The King did give the Duke of York a sound reprimand; told him that he had lived with him with more kindness than ever any brother King lived with a brother, and that he lived as much like a monarch as himself, but advised him not to cross him in his designs about the Chancellor.

1667-10-16 10:30   The Commons and Lords have concurred, and delivered the King their thanks, among other things, for his removal of the Chancellor; who took their thanks very well, and, among other things, promised them never, in any degree, to entertain the Chancellor any employment again.

1667-10-15 17:53 r But here, before the play begun, my wife begun to complain to me of Willet’s confidence in sitting cheek by jowl by us, which was a poor thing; but I perceive she is already jealous of my kindness to her, so that I begin to fear this girl is not likely to stay long with us.

1667-10-15 17:48   My wife and I and Willet to the Duke of York’s house, where, after long stay, the King and Duke of York come, and there saw “The Coffee-house,” the most ridiculous, insipid play that ever I saw in my life, and glad we were that Betterton had no part in it.

1667-10-15 09:03   Up, and to the office, where, Sir W. Pen being ill of the gout, we all of us met there in his parlour and did the business of the office, our greatest business now being to manage the pay of the ships in order and with speed to satisfy the Commissioners of the Treasury.

1667-10-14 18:20   To the Duke of York’s House, and there went in for nothing into the pit, at the last act, to see Sir Martin Marrall, and met my wife, and my brother, and W. Hewer and Willett, and carried them home, being pleased with the humour of the play, almost above all that ever I saw.

1667-10-14 14:10   To Westminster Hall, and there walked with Mr. Scowen, who tells me that it is at last carried in the House that the thanks shall be given to the King — among other things, particularly for the removal of my Lord Chancellor.

1667-10-14 13:41   To my Lord Crew, to see him after my coming out of the country, and he seems satisfied with some steps they have made in my absence towards my Lord Sandwich’s relief for money: and so I have no more to do, nor will trouble myself more about it till they send for me.

1667-10-14 10:15 r And his mother is one that encourages him in it, so that they are at this time upon very bad terms one with another, and desires that I would take a time to advise him and tell him what it becomes him to do, which office I am glad of, for some ends of my own also con sa fille.

1667-10-14 10:10   I to Mrs. Martin’s, where by appointment comes to me Mrs. Howlett, which I was afraid was to have told me something of my freedom with her daughter, but it was not so, but only to complain to me of her son-in-law, how he abuses and makes a slave of her.

1667-10-13 20:37   So in a-doors and supped with my wife and brother, W. Hewer, and Willett, and so evened with W. Hewer for my expenses upon the road this last journey, and do think that the whole journey will cost me little less than 18l. or 20l., one way or other.

1667-10-13 16:02   By water again to White Hall, and thence only walked to Mrs. Martin’s, and there sat with her and her sister and Borroughs and did tocar la prima, and there drank and talked and away by water home.

1667-10-13 09:10   The Duke of York did call me to him, and tell me that he had spoke to the King, and that the King had granted me the ship I asked for; and did, moreover, say that he was mightily satisfied with my service, and that he would be willing to do anything that was in his power for me.

1667-10-12 19:40   Sir W. Pen says that Lady Batten and her children-in-law are all broke in pieces, and that there is but 800l. found in the world, of money; and is in great doubt what we shall do towards the doing ourselves right with them, about the prize-money.

1667-10-12 18:23 r The King declared by my Lord Keeper how many acts he had done since he saw them; among others, disbanding the army, and putting all Papists out of employment, and displacing persons that had managed their business ill. The Parliament is mightily pleased with the King’s speech.

1667-10-12 18:20   I hear by Mr. Pierce the surgeon; and then by Mr. Lewes, and also by Mr. Hater, that the King did make the Parliament a very kind speech, promising them to leave all to them to do, and call to account what and whom they pleased.

1667-10-12 17:30   At home we find that Sir W. Batten’s burial was today carried from hence, with a hundred or two of coaches, to Walthamstow, and there buried.

1667-10-12 17:12 r Home, where I find all well; and did bring my gold, to my heart’s content, safe home, having not this day carried it in a basket, but in our hands: the girl took care of one, and my wife another bag, and I the rest, I being afraid of the bottom of the coach lest it should break.

1667-10-11 20:38 r We sat down to talk, and were very pleasant, satisfying myself, among other things, from John Bowles, in some terms of hunting, and about deere, bucks, and does. And so anon to supper, and very merry we were, and a good supper.

1667-10-11 17:00 r At Stevenage we come well before night, and all sat, and there with great care I got the gold up to the chamber, my wife carrying one bag, and the girl another, and W. Hewer the rest in the basket, and set it all under a bed in our chamber.

1667-10-11 16:16 r My gold I put into a basket, and set under one of the seats; and so my work every quarter of an hour was to look to see whether all was well; and I did ride in great fear all the day, but it was a pleasant day, and good company, and I mightily contented.

1667-10-11 10:20 r My sister cried at my going; but whether it was at her unwillingness for my going, or any unkindness of my wife’s, or no, I know not; but, God forgive me! I take her to be so cunning and ill-natured, that I have no great love for her.

1667-10-11 10:05 r We to breakfast, and then took coach, my wife and I, and Willet, and W. Hewer, and Murford and John Bowles (whom my Lady lent me), and my brother John on horseback; and with these four I thought myself pretty safe.

1667-10-11 09:12 r It gives me some kind of content to remember how painful it is sometimes to keep money, as well as to get it, and how doubtful I was how to keep it all night, and how to secure it to London: and so got all my gold put up in bags.

1667-10-11 09:10 r I do leave my father to make a second examination of the dirt, which he promises he will do, and, poor man, is mightily troubled for this accident, but I declared myself very well satisfied, and so indeed I am.

1667-10-11 09:05 r To our great content, did with much trouble (and by the time we emptied several pails and could not find one), we did make the last night’s forty-five up seventy-nine: so that we are come to about twenty or thirty of what I think the true number should be.

1667-10-11 07:15 r W. Hewer and I, with pails and a sieve, did lock ourselves into the garden, and there gather all the earth about the place into pails, and then sift those pails in one of the summer-houses, just as they do for dyamonds in other parts of the world.

1667-10-11 01:52 r So W. Hewer and I out again about midnight, for it was now grown so late, and there by candlelight did make shift to gather forty-five pieces more. And so in, and to cleanse them.

1667-10-10 23:47 r Considering that the neighbour’s house was so near that we could not suppose we could speak one to another in the garden at the place where the gold lay, I feared that they might in the night come and gather some pieces and prevent us the next morning.

1667-10-10 23:24 r W. Hewer and I did, with several pails of water and basins, at last wash the dirt off of the pieces, and parted the pieces and the dirt; and by a note which I had of the value of the whole in my pocket, do find that there was short above a hundred pieces, which did make me mad.

1667-10-10 21:45 r I perceive the earth was got among the gold, and wet, so that the bags were all rotten, and all the notes, that I could not tell what in the world to say to it, not knowing how to judge what was wanting: which, all put together, did make me mad.

1667-10-10 21:33 r But, good God! to see how sillily they did it, not half a foot under ground, and in the sight of the world from a hundred places, if any body by accident were near hand, and within sight of a neighbour’s window, and their hearing also, being close by.

1667-10-10 21:12 r At last to fear that it was gone but by and by poking with a spit, we found it, and then begun with a spudd to lift up the ground.

1667-10-10 20:55 r But, Lord! what a tosse I was for some time in, that they could not justly tell where it was; that I begun heartily to sweat, and be angry, that they should not agree better upon the place.

1667-10-10 20:15 r My father and I, with a dark lantern; it being now night, into the garden with my wife, and there went about our great work to dig up my gold.

1667-10-10 16:37 r They repeating a whole ode without book out of Horace, and did give me a very good account of any thing almost, and did make me very readily very good Latin, and did give me good account of their Greek grammar, beyond all possible expectation.

1667-10-10 16:34 r I spent alone with my Lady the most of the afternoon, and anon the two twins were sent for from school, to come to see me, and I took them into the garden, and there, did examine them, and do find them so well advanced in their learning, that I was amazed at it.

1667-10-10 13:57 r Went all of us, my sister and brother, and W. Hewer, to dinner to Hinchingbroke, where we had a good plain country dinner, but most kindly used; and here dined the Minister of Brampton and his wife, who is reported a very good, but poor man.

1667-10-10 10:30 r Then walked round about our Greene, to see whether, in case I cannot buy out my uncle Thomas and his son’s right in this house, that I can buy another place as good thereabouts to build on, and I do not see that I can.

1667-10-10 08:10 r Up to walk up and down the garden with my father, to talk of all our concernments: about a husband for my sister, whereof there is at present no appearance; then for my brother; and resolve he shall stay here this winter, and then I will either send him to Cambridge for a year.

1667-10-10 07:03   Waked with great pain of the collique, by cold taken yesterday, I believe, with going up and down in my shirt, but with rubbing my belly, keeping of it warm, I did at last come to some ease, and rose.

1667-10-09 22:05 r I perceive there was some great falling out when my wife was here last, but the reason I have no mind to enquire after, for vexing myself, being desirous to pass my time with as much mirth as I can while I am abroad.

1667-10-09 22:00 r We all to bed, only I a little troubled that my father tells me that he is troubled that my wife shows my sister no countenance, and, him but very little, but is as a stranger in the house; and I do observe she do carry herself very high.

1667-10-09 19:28 r We took leave with all possible kindness, and so home, and there Mr. Shepley staid with us and supped, and full of good country discourse.

1667-10-09 17:51 r I do find, by my Lady, that they are reduced to great straits for money, having been forced to sell her plate, 8 or 900l. worth; and she is now going to sell a suit of her best hangings, of which I could almost wish to buy a piece or two, if the pieces will be broke.

1667-10-09 17:13 r By and by my wife comes with Willet, my wife in her velvett vest, which is mighty fine, and becomes her exceedingly. I am pleased with my Lady Paulina and Anne, who both are grown very proper ladies, and handsome enough.

1667-10-09 16:44 r I walked up to Hinchingbroke, where my Lady expected me; and there spent all the afternoon with her: the same most excellent, good, discreet lady that ever she was; and is mightily pleased with the lady that is like to be her son Hinchingbroke’s wife which I am mightily glad of.

1667-10-09 12:50 r I bless God that I am like to have such a pretty place to retire to: and I did walk with my father without doors, and do find a very convenient way of laying out money there in building, which will make a very good seat, and the place deserves it, I think, very well.

1667-10-09 12:40 r Up and down to see the garden with my father, and the house, and do altogether find it very pretty; especially the little parlour and the summerhouses in the garden, only the wall do want greens upon it, and the house is too low-roofed.

1667-10-09 12:10 r And so away for Huntingdon mightily pleased all along the road to remember old stories; and come to Brampton at about noon, and there find my father and sister and brother all well and here laid up our things.

1667-10-09 08:05 r And the town musique did also come and play: but, Lord! what sad music they made! However, I was pleased with them, being all of us in very good humour, and so through the town, and observed at our College of Magdalene the posts new painted.

1667-10-09 07:30   Up, and got ready, and eat our breakfast; and then took coach: and the poor, as they did yesterday, did stand at the coach to have something given them, as they do to all great persons; and I did give them something.

1667-10-08 21:57 r After supper, to cards; and then to bed, lying, I in one bed, and my wife and girl in another, in the same room, and very merry talking together, and mightily pleased both of us with the girl.

1667-10-08 17:30 r I took my wife, and W. Hewer, and Willet and showed them Trinity College and St. John’s Library, and went to King’s College Chapel, to see the outside of it only; and so to our inne, and with much pleasure did this, they walking in their pretty morning gowns, very handsome.

1667-10-08 16:15 r Here we parted with Lowther and his friends, and away to Cambridge, it being foul, rainy weather, and there did take up at the Rose, for the sake of Mrs. Dorothy Drawwater, the vintner’s daughter, which is mentioned in the play of Sir Martin Marrall.

1667-10-08 14:07 r And then to the garden, and there eat many grapes, and took some with us and so away thence, exceeding well satisfied, though not to that degree that, by my old esteem of the house, I ought and did expect to have done, the situation of it not pleasing me.

1667-10-08 13:30 r Only the gallery is good, and, above all things, the cellars, where we went down and drank of much good liquor; and indeed the cellars are fine: and here my wife and I did sing to my great content.

1667-10-08 13:18 r Though the figure of the house without be very extraordinary good, yet the stayre-case is exceeding poor; and a great many pictures, and not one good one in the house but one of Harry the Eighth, done by Holben; and not one good suit of hangings in all the house.

1667-10-08 12:30 r They went with us to Audley-End, and did go along with us all over the house and garden: and mighty merry we were. The house indeed do appear very fine, but not so fine as it hath heretofore to me; particularly the ceilings are not so good as I always took them to be.

1667-10-08 10:05 r At last, rose, and up, and broke our fast, and then took coach, and away, and at Newport did call on Mr. Lowther, and he and his friend, and the master of the house, their friend, where they were, a gentleman, did presently get a-horseback and overtook us.

1667-10-08 06:50   Up pretty betimes, though not so soon as we intended, by reason of Murford’s not rising, and then not knowing how to open our door, which, and some other pleasant simplicities of the fellow, did give occasion to us to call him Sir Martin Marrall.

1667-10-07 21:50 r And so to bed, my wife and I in one bed, and the girl in another, in the same room, and lay very well, but there was so much tearing company in the house, that we could not see my landlady; so I had no opportunity of renewing my old acquaintance with her.

1667-10-07 19:21 r I fell to write my letter to my Lord Sandwich, which I could not finish before my coming from London; so did finish it to my good content, telling him the present state of all matters, and did get a man to promise to carry it tomorrow morning, to be there, at my house, by noon.

1667-10-07 16:35 r It was the woman that was great with my cozen Barnston of Cottenham, and did use to sing to him and did teach me “Full forty times over” a very lewd song. A woman they are well acquainted with, and is here what she was at Cambridge, and all the good fellows come hither.

1667-10-07 16:30 r We parted, we going before them, my wife and girl and I telling tales, and singing, and before night come to Bishop Stafford, where Lowther and his friend did meet us again and carried us to the Raynedeere, where Mrs. Aynsworth, whom I knew better than they think for, do live.

1667-10-07 12:04 r So we to Enfield, and there bayted, it being but a foul, bad day, and there Lowther and Mr. Burford, an acquaintance of his, did overtake us, and there drank and eat together.

1667-10-07 10:30 r We set out, and so out at Allgate, and so to the Green Man, and so on to Enfield, in our way seeing Mr. Lowther and his lady in a coach, going to Walthamstow; and he told us that he would overtake us at night, he being to go that way.

1667-10-07 06:15   Up betimes, and did do several things towards the settling all matters both of house and office in order for my journey this day, and did leave my chief care, and the key of my closet, with Mr. Hater, with directions what papers to secure, in case of fire or other accident.

1667-10-06 20:43   Home to supper, where Pelling comes and sits with me, and there tells us how old Mr. Batelier is dead this last night in the night, going to bed well, which I am mightily troubled for, he being a good man.

1667-10-06 10:48   To White Hall, and there met Sir W. Coventry, and discoursed with him, and then with my Lord Bruncker, and many others, to end my matters in order to my going into the country tomorrow for five or six days, which I have not done for above three years.

1667-10-06 08:04   Up, and dressed myself, and so walked out with the boy to Smithfield to Cow Lane, to Lincolne’s, and there spoke with him, and agreed upon the hour tomorrow, to set out towards Brampton; but vexed that he is not likely to go himself, but sends another for him.

1667-10-05 15:24 r But to see how Nell cursed, for having so few people in the pit, was pretty; the other house carrying away all the people at the new play, and is said, now-a-days, to have generally most company, as being better players.

1667-10-05 15:09 r But, Lord! to see how they were painted would make a man mad, and did make me loath them; and what base company of men comes among them, and how lewdly they talk! and how poor the men are in clothes and yet what a show they make on the stage by candle-light, is very observable.

1667-10-05 15:03 r And so walked all up and down the house above, and then below into the scene-room, and there sat down, and she gave us fruit and here I read the Qu’s to Knepp, while she answered me, through all her part of “Flora’s Figary’s,” which was acted today.

1667-10-05 14:30   To the Duke of York’s playhouse, but the house so full, it being a new play, “The Coffee House,” that we could not get in, and so to the King’s house: and there met with Knepp and she took us up into the tireing-rooms: and to the women’s shift, where Nell was dressing herself.

1667-10-05 12:10   Sir G. Carteret walked with me and concluded not to concern or have any advice made to Sir W. Coventry, in behalf of my Lord Sandwich’s business; I do think they are all mad, that they will judge Sir W. Coventry an enemy, when he is indeed no such man to any body.

1667-10-05 11:03   Much surprized with the news of the death of Sir W. Batten, who died this morning, having been but two days sick. Sir W. Pen and I did dispatch a letter this morning, to recommend Colonel Middleton, who we think a most honest and understanding man, and fit for that place.

1667-10-04 20:02   Word is brought me that Sir W. Batten is so ill, that it is believed he cannot live till tomorrow, which troubles me and my wife mightily, partly out of kindness, he being a good neighbour and partly because of the money he owes me, upon our bargain of the late prize.

1667-10-04 17:30   To my Lord Crew’s, and there did stay with him an hour till almost night, discoursing about the ill state of my Lord Sandwich, that he can neither be got to be called home, nor money got to maintain him there; which will ruin his family.

1667-10-04 15:10   I to Westminster, to Mrs. Martin’s lodging, whither I sent for her, and there hear that her husband is come from sea, which is sooner than I expected; and here I staid and drank, and so did tocar ella and away, and so by coach to my tailor’s.

1667-10-03 18:40   We to my tailor’s and, the coachman desiring to go home to change his horses, we went with him into a nasty end of St. Giles’s and went into a nasty room, where he hath a wife and child, and staid, it growing dark, and I angry thereat, till he shifted his horses, and home apace.

1667-10-03 11:16 r The woman is a very wise woman, and is very plain in telling me how her plate and jewels are at pawne for money, and how they are forced to live beyond their estate, and do get nothing by his being a courtier. The lady I pity, and her family.

1667-10-03 11:12   I to my Lady Peterboroughlking about her husband’s pension, and how she hath got an order for its being paid again; though, I believe, for all that order, it will hardly be; but of that I said nothing; but her design is to get it paid again.

1667-10-03 09:50   Sir W. Coventry took me into the gallery, and walked with me an hour, discoursing of Navy business, and with much kindness to, and confidence in, me still; which I must endeavour to preserve, and will do.

1667-10-03 07:58   Up, and going out of doors, I understand that Sir W. Batten is gone to bed on a sudden again this morning, being struck very ill, and I confess I have observed him for these last two months to look very ill and to look worse and worse.

1667-10-02 17:34   By coach to the New Exchange, and there met my wife and girl, and took them to the King’s house to see “The Traytour,” which still I like as a very good play.

1667-10-02 12:30   This morning come to me Mr. Gawden about business, with his gold chain about his neck, as being Sheriffe of the City this year.

1667-10-01 22:05   Late in the dark round by the wall home by coach, and there to sing and sup with my wife, and look upon our pretty girl, and so to bed.

1667-10-01 19:50 r Here was a great press of people; but I did not see many pleased with it, only the instrumental music he had brought by practice to play very just.

1667-10-01 19:16 r But, God forgive me! I never was so little pleased with a concert of music in my life. The manner of setting of words and repeating them out of order, and that with a number of voices, makes me sick, the whole design of vocall music being lost by it.

1667-10-01 19:05   To White Hall, and there in the Boarded-gallery did hear the music with which the King is presented this night by Monsieur Grebus, the master of his music; both instrumental — I think twenty-four violins — and vocall; an English song upon Peace.

1667-10-01 15:40   Took coach and to my wife, who was gone before into the Strand, there to buy a nightgown, where I found her in a shop with her pretty girl, and having bought it away home.

1667-10-01 11:45   All the morning busy at the office, pleased mightily with my girl that we have got to wait on my wife.
