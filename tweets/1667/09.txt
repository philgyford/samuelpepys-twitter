1667-09-08 21:52   My mind a little troubled at my late breach of vows, which however I will pay my forfeits, though the badness of my eyes, making me unfit to read or write long, is my excuse, and do put me upon other pleasures and employment which I should refrain from in observation of my vows.

1667-09-08 12:30 r So to White Hall, and saw the King and Queen at dinner; and observed (which I never did before), the formality, but it is but a formality, of putting a bit of bread wiped upon each dish into the mouth of every man that brings a dish; but it should be in the sauce.

1667-09-08 11:00 r To the Queen’s Chapel and there hear their music, which I liked in itself pretty well as to the composition, but their voices are very harsh and rough that I thought it was some instruments they had that made them sound so.

1667-09-08 09:45 r He told me of our base condition, in the treaty with Holland and France, that whereas before we did clear one another’s prisoners, man for man, and we upon the publication of the peace did release all our’s, the Dutch do keep theirs.

1667-09-08 09:32 r He told me he had been seven years finding out a man that could dress English sheepskin as it should be — and, indeed, it is now as good, in all respects, as kid, and he says will save 100,000l. a-year, that goes out to France for kids skins.

1667-09-08 09:30 r Here I met Sir G. Downing, who would speak with me, and first to inquire what I paid for my kids leather gloves I had on my hand, and shewed me others on his, as handsome, as good in all points, cost him but 12d. a pair, and mine me 2s.

1667-09-08 08:55   I went to the King’s Chapel to the closet, and there I hear Cresset sing a tenor part along with the Church music very handsomely, but so loud that people did laugh at him, as a thing done for ostentation.

1667-09-07 20:44 r Then called my wife at the ’Change, and bought a nightgown for my wife: cost but 24s., and so out to Mile End to drink.

1667-09-07 19:50   Out by coach with my wife, she to the ’Change, and I to see the price of a copper cisterne for the table, which is very pretty, and they demand 6l. or 7l. for one; but I will have one.

1667-09-07 12:10   Home to dinner, where Goodgroome was teaching my wife, and dined with us, and I did tell him of my intention to learn to trill, which he will not promise I shall obtain, but he will do what can be done, and I am resolved to learn.

1667-09-06 20:40 r Then we to see a piece of clocke-work made by an Englishman — indeed, very good, wherein all the several states of man’s age, to 100 years old, is shewn very pretty and solemne; and several other things more cheerful.

1667-09-06 20:28   To Bartholomew fair, and there we saw a poor fellow, whose legs were tied behind his back, dance upon his hands with his arse above his head, and also dance upon his crutches, without any legs upon the ground to help him, which he did with that pain that I was sorry to see it.

1667-09-06 14:10 r So we come to Sir W. Batten’s, where Sir W. Pen and his Lady, and we and Mrs. Shipman, and here we walked and had an indifferent good dinner, the victuals very good and cleanly dressed and good linen, but no fine meat at all.

1667-09-06 11:25 r Mrs. Turner and I much discourse all the way touching the baseness of Sir W. Pen and sluttishness of his family, and how the world do suspect that his son Lowther, who is sick of a sore mouth, has got the pox.

1667-09-06 10:28   To Westminster, into the Hall, and bought “Guillim’s Heraldry” for my wife, and so to the Swan, and thither come Doll Lane, and je did toucher her, and so away, I took coach and home, where I find my wife gone to Walthamstow by invitation with Sir W. Batten, and so I followed.

1667-09-05 17:00 r My wife was ill, and so I was forced to go out of the house with her to Lincoln’s Inn walks, and there in a corner she did her business, and was by and by well, and so into the house again, but sick of their ill acting.

1667-09-05 16:32 r I resolve not to come thither again a good while, believing that this negligence, which I never observed before, proceeds only from their want of company in the pit, that they have no care how they act.

1667-09-05 16:30   With Sir W. Pen, my wife, and Mary Batelier to the Duke of York’s house, and there saw “Heraclius,” which is a good play; but they did so spoil it with their laughing, and being all of them out, and with the noise they made within the theatre, that I was ashamed of it.

1667-09-05 13:58   I home to dinner, where Mary Batelier and her brother dined with us, who grows troublesome in his talking so much of his going to Marseilles, and what commissions he hath to execute as a factor, and a deal of do of which I am weary.

1667-09-05 09:22   Sir W. Batten do hear from Mr. Grey, who hath good intelligence, that our Queen is to go into a nunnery, there to spend her days; and that my Lady Castlemayne is going into France, and is to have a pension of 4000l. a year. This latter I do more believe than the other.

1667-09-04 17:42   To the Duke of York’s play house and there saw “Mustapha” which, the more I see, the more I like; only both Betterton and Harris could not contain from laughing in the midst of a most serious part from the ridiculous mistake of one of the men upon the stage; which I did not like.

1667-09-04 14:10   With my wife and W. Hewer to Bartholomew fayre, and there Polichinelli, where we saw Mrs. Clerke and all her crew; and so to a private house, and sent for a side of pig, and eat it at an acquaintance of W. Hewer’s, where there was some learned physic and chymical books.

1667-09-04 11:20   I heard Alderman Barker’s case of his being abused by the Council of Ireland, touching his lands there: all I observed is the silliness of the King, playing with his dog all the while, and not minding the business, and what he said was mighty weak.

1667-09-04 10:32   Sir W. Coventry told me that he was just come from delivering up his seal and papers to Mr. Wren; and told me he must now take his leave of me as a naval man, but that he shall always bear respect to his friends there, and particularly to myself, with great kindness.

1667-09-03 14:40   I to St. James’s, and there attended the Duke of York about the list of ships that we propose to sell; and here there attended Mr. Wren the first time, who hath not yet, I think, received the Duke of York’s seal and papers.

1667-09-02 22:04   This day Nell, an old tall maid, come to live with us, a cook maid recommended by Mr. Batelier.

1667-09-02 16:50 r Mr. Ashburnham told me that it is only the King’s curiosity, which he usually hath of weighing himself before and after his play, to see how much he loses in weight by playing: and this day he lost 4 lbs.

1667-09-02 16:04   I went to see a great match at tennis, between Prince Rupert and one Captain Cooke, against Bab. May and the elder Chichly; where the King was, and Court; and it seems are the best players at tennis in the nation.

1667-09-02 14:43 r When Mr. Ashburnham was gone, Townsend told me that it is the grooms taking away the King’s linen at the quarter’s end, as their fees, which makes this great want.

1667-09-02 14:30 r Comes in Mr. Townsend; and I was witness of a horrid rateing, which Mr. Ashburnham, as one of the Grooms of the King’s Bedchamber, did give him for want of linen for the King’s person; which he swore was not to be endured, and that the King would not endure.

1667-09-02 14:12   In discourse at dinner concerning the change of men’s humours, Mr. Ashburnham told us that he remembers since the only fruit eaten by the King and Queen at table as the best fruit, was the Katharine payre, though they knew at the time other fruits of France and our own country.

1667-09-02 10:42 r The Duke of York hath chosen Mr. Wren, which I am glad of, he being a very ingenious man; and so Sir W. Coventry says of him, though he knows him little; but particularly commends him for the book he writ in answer to “Harrington’s Oceana,” which I intend to buy.

1667-09-02 10:30   Sir W. Coventry called me down with him to his chamber, and there told me that he is leaving the Duke of York’s service, which I was amazed at. But he tells me that it is not with the least unkindness on the Duke of York’s side.

1667-09-02 09:15   This day is kept in the City as a public fast for the fire this day twelve months: but I was not at church, being commanded, with the rest, to attend the Duke of York.

1667-09-01 19:44 r But, on the contrary, I find she hath bought them for me to pay for them, without my knowledge. This do displease me much; but yet do so much please me better than if she had received them the other way, that I was not much angry.

1667-09-01 19:40   My wife and I to walk in the garden and there scolded a little, I being doubtful that she had received a couple of fine pinners (one of point de Gesne), which I feared she hath from someone or other of a present.

1667-09-01 17:33 r Spent all the afternoon, Pelling, Howe, and I, and my boy, singing of Lock’s response to the Ten Commandments, which he hath set very finely, and was a good while since sung before the King, and spoiled in the performance, which occasioned his printing them for his vindication.

1667-09-01 14:21   Home and by water to dinner, where comes Pelling and young Michell and his wife, whom I have not seen a great while, poor girl, and then comes Mr. Howe, and all dined with me very merry.

1667-09-01 10:10   Blancfort is made Privy-purse to the Duke of York; the Attorney-general is made Chief justice, in the room of my Lord Bridgeman; the Solicitor-general is made Attorney-general; and Sir Edward Turner made Solicitor-general.

1667-09-01 08:31   I to Mrs. Martin’s, where I had two pair of cuffs which I bespoke, and there did sit and talk with her and no mas, ella having aquellos upon her, and here I did see her little girle my goddaughter, which will be pretty.

1667-09-01 07:03   Up, and betimes by water from the Tower, and called at the Old Swan for a glass of strong water, and sent word to have little Michell and his wife come and dine with us today.
