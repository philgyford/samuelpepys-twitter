1667-09-15 22:21   My wife and I to my chamber, where, through the badness of my eyes, she was forced to read to me, which she do very well, and was Mr. Boyle’s discourse upon the style of the Scripture, which is a very fine piece, and so to bed.

1667-09-15 17:37 r Here we sung several good things, but I am more and more confirmed that singing with many voices is not singing, but a sort of instrumental music, the sense of the words being lost by not being heard, and especially as they set them with Fuges of words, one after another.

1667-09-15 16:47   There comes Mr. Pelling, with two men, by promise, one Wallington and Piggott, the former whereof, being a very little fellow, did sing a most excellent bass, and yet a poor fellow, a working goldsmith, that goes without gloves to his hands.

1667-09-15 12:04 r Mr. Mills preached, and after sermon, by invitation, he and his wife come to dine with me, which is the first time they have been in my house; I think, these five years, I thinking it not amiss, because of their acquaintance in our country, to shew them some respect.

1667-09-15 11:04   To church, where I stood, in fear of Mrs. Markham’s coming to church, and offering to come into our pew, to prevent which, soon as ever I heard the great door open, I did step back and clap my breech to our pew-door, that she might be forced to shove me to come in.

1667-09-14 22:20   And so to bed, being mightily troubled in mind at the liberty I give myself of going to plays upon pretence of the weakness of my eyes, that cannot continue so long together at work at my office, but I must remedy it.

1667-09-14 17:40   To the King’s play-house to see “The Northerne Lasse,” which I think I never did see before. Knipp acted in it, and did her part very extraordinary well; but the play is but a mean, sorry play; but the house very full of gallants. It seems, it hath not been acted a good while.

1667-09-14 13:20 r Mr. Peirce do think that what the King do, of giving the Duke of Monmouth the command of his Guards, and giving my Lord Gerard 12,000l. for it, is merely to find an employment for him upon which he may live, and not out of any design to bring him into any title to the Crowne.

1667-09-14 12:32   Mr. Pierce told me that the King and Duke of York and the whole Court is mighty joyful at the Duchesse of York’s being brought to bed this day, or yesterday, of a son; which will settle men’s minds mightily.

1667-09-13 13:55 r Here a very good and plentifull wholesome dinner, and, above all thing, such plenty of milk meats, she keeping a great dairy, and so good as I never met with.

1667-09-13 12:47   With Sir W. Batten and my wife and Mrs. Turner to Walthamstow, to Mrs. Shipman’s to dinner, where Sir W. Pen and my Lady and Mrs. Lowther (the latter of which hath got a sore nose given her, I believe, from her husband, which made me I could not look upon her with any pleasure).

1667-09-13 06:40 r They sell at about 28s. or 29s. per chaldron; but Sir W. Batten hath sworn that he was a cuckold that sells under 30s., and that makes us lay up all but what we have for our own spending, which is very pleasant; for I believe we shall be glad to sell them for less.

1667-09-13 06:32   Called up by people come to deliver in ten chaldron of coals, brought in one of our prizes from Newcastle. The rest we intend to sell, we having above ten chaldron between us.

1667-09-12 21:04   Home, and mightily pleased with my wife’s playing on the flageolet, she taking out any tune almost at first sight, and keeping time to it, which pleases me mightily.

1667-09-12 17:27   At the Duke’s house, where “Tu Quoque” was the first time acted, with some alterations of Sir W. Davenant’s; but the play is a very silly play, methinks; for I, and others that sat by me, Mr. Povy and Mr. Progers, were weary of it; but it will please the citizens.

1667-09-11 22:15   I to bed, being mightily pleased with my wife’s playing so well upon the flageolet, and I am resolved she shall learn to play upon some instrument, for though her eare be bad, yet I see she will attain any thing to be done by her hand.

1667-09-11 19:20   Mr. Moore sat and discoursed with me of public matters: the sum of which is, that he do doubt that there is more at the bottom than the removal of the Chancellor; that is, he do verily believe that the King do resolve to declare the Duke of Monmouth legitimate.

1667-09-11 17:32   I by coach to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there saw part of “The Ungratefull Lovers;” and sat by Beck Marshall, who is very handsome near hand.

1667-09-11 14:28 r Mrs. Lowther is grown a fool, having not a word to say almost all dinner; and, as a further mark of a beggarly, proud fool, hath a bracelet of diamonds and rubies about her wrist, and a sixpenny necklace about her neck, and not one good rag of clothes upon her back.

1667-09-11 14:20 r I had an extraordinary good and handsome dinner for them, better than any of them deserve or understand, saving Sir John Chichly and Mrs. Turner, and not much mirth, only what I by discourse made, and that against my genius.

1667-09-11 12:50 r Anon comes Sir W. Batten and his lady, and Mr. Griffith, their ward, and Sir W. Pen and his lady, and Mrs. Lowther, and Sir John Chichly in their company, and Mrs. Turner.

1667-09-11 11:04   To the ’Change, and there bought a case of knives for dinner, and a dish of fruit for 5s., and bespoke other things, and then home, and here I find all things in good order, and a good dinner towards.

1667-09-10 21:30   To my chamber with my boy to lay up some papers and things that lay out of order against tomorrow, to make it clear against the feast that I am to have.

1667-09-10 15:45 r Mr. Povy tells me that he believes there is no such thing like to be as a composition with my Lady Castlemayne; for he says she is as high as ever she was, though he believes the King is as weary of her as is possible, and would give any thing to remove her.

1667-09-10 15:30   Mr. Povy tells me, among other things, that this business of the Chancellor do breed a kind of inward distance between the King and the Duke of York, and that it cannot be avoided; but he tells me that they are, and have always been, great dissemblers one towards another.

1667-09-09 22:05   Home to supper and to bed, after a little playing on the flageolet with my wife, who do outdo therein whatever I expected of her.

1667-09-09 20:36 r I saw the prize fought, till one of them, a shoemaker, was so cut in both his wrists that he could not fight any longer, and then they broke off: his enemy was a butcher. The sport very good, and various humours to be seen among the rabble that is there.

1667-09-09 20:05 r By a back-way I was put into the bull-house, where I stood a good while all alone among the bulls, and was afeard I was among the bears, too; but by and by the door opened, and I got into the common pit; and there, with my cloak about my face, I stood.

1667-09-09 19:45 r I by water to the Bear-Garden, where now the yard was full of people, and those most of them seamen, striving by force to get in, that I was afeard to be seen among them, but got into the ale-house.

1667-09-09 19:25   I fell in talk with Tom Killigrew about music, and he tells me that he will bring me to the best music in England (of which, indeed, he is master), and that is two Italians and Mrs. Yates, who, he says, is come to sing the Italian manner as well as ever he heard any.

1667-09-09 19:15   For certain news is come of Harman’s having spoiled nineteen of twenty-two French ships, somewhere about the Barbadoes, I think they said; but wherever it is, it is a good service, and very welcome.

1667-09-09 18:30   Creed and I and my wife to the Bear-Garden, to see a prize fought there. But, coming too soon, I left them there and went on to White Hall and there did some business with the Lords of the Treasury.

1667-09-08 21:52   My mind a little troubled at my late breach of vows, which however I will pay my forfeits, though the badness of my eyes, making me unfit to read or write long, is my excuse, and do put me upon other pleasures and employment which I should refrain from in observation of my vows.

1667-09-08 12:30 r So to White Hall, and saw the King and Queen at dinner; and observed (which I never did before), the formality, but it is but a formality, of putting a bit of bread wiped upon each dish into the mouth of every man that brings a dish; but it should be in the sauce.

1667-09-08 11:00 r To the Queen’s Chapel and there hear their music, which I liked in itself pretty well as to the composition, but their voices are very harsh and rough that I thought it was some instruments they had that made them sound so.

1667-09-08 09:45 r He told me of our base condition, in the treaty with Holland and France, that whereas before we did clear one another’s prisoners, man for man, and we upon the publication of the peace did release all our’s, the Dutch do keep theirs.

1667-09-08 09:32 r He told me he had been seven years finding out a man that could dress English sheepskin as it should be — and, indeed, it is now as good, in all respects, as kid, and he says will save 100,000l. a-year, that goes out to France for kids skins.

1667-09-08 09:30 r Here I met Sir G. Downing, who would speak with me, and first to inquire what I paid for my kids leather gloves I had on my hand, and shewed me others on his, as handsome, as good in all points, cost him but 12d. a pair, and mine me 2s.

1667-09-08 08:55   I went to the King’s Chapel to the closet, and there I hear Cresset sing a tenor part along with the Church music very handsomely, but so loud that people did laugh at him, as a thing done for ostentation.

1667-09-07 20:44 r Then called my wife at the ’Change, and bought a nightgown for my wife: cost but 24s., and so out to Mile End to drink.

1667-09-07 19:50   Out by coach with my wife, she to the ’Change, and I to see the price of a copper cisterne for the table, which is very pretty, and they demand 6l. or 7l. for one; but I will have one.

1667-09-07 12:10   Home to dinner, where Goodgroome was teaching my wife, and dined with us, and I did tell him of my intention to learn to trill, which he will not promise I shall obtain, but he will do what can be done, and I am resolved to learn.

1667-09-06 20:40 r Then we to see a piece of clocke-work made by an Englishman — indeed, very good, wherein all the several states of man’s age, to 100 years old, is shewn very pretty and solemne; and several other things more cheerful.

1667-09-06 20:28   To Bartholomew fair, and there we saw a poor fellow, whose legs were tied behind his back, dance upon his hands with his arse above his head, and also dance upon his crutches, without any legs upon the ground to help him, which he did with that pain that I was sorry to see it.

1667-09-06 14:10 r So we come to Sir W. Batten’s, where Sir W. Pen and his Lady, and we and Mrs. Shipman, and here we walked and had an indifferent good dinner, the victuals very good and cleanly dressed and good linen, but no fine meat at all.

1667-09-06 11:25 r Mrs. Turner and I much discourse all the way touching the baseness of Sir W. Pen and sluttishness of his family, and how the world do suspect that his son Lowther, who is sick of a sore mouth, has got the pox.

1667-09-06 10:28   To Westminster, into the Hall, and bought “Guillim’s Heraldry” for my wife, and so to the Swan, and thither come Doll Lane, and je did toucher her, and so away, I took coach and home, where I find my wife gone to Walthamstow by invitation with Sir W. Batten, and so I followed.

1667-09-05 17:00 r My wife was ill, and so I was forced to go out of the house with her to Lincoln’s Inn walks, and there in a corner she did her business, and was by and by well, and so into the house again, but sick of their ill acting.

1667-09-05 16:32 r I resolve not to come thither again a good while, believing that this negligence, which I never observed before, proceeds only from their want of company in the pit, that they have no care how they act.

1667-09-05 16:30   With Sir W. Pen, my wife, and Mary Batelier to the Duke of York’s house, and there saw “Heraclius,” which is a good play; but they did so spoil it with their laughing, and being all of them out, and with the noise they made within the theatre, that I was ashamed of it.

1667-09-05 13:58   I home to dinner, where Mary Batelier and her brother dined with us, who grows troublesome in his talking so much of his going to Marseilles, and what commissions he hath to execute as a factor, and a deal of do of which I am weary.

1667-09-05 09:22   Sir W. Batten do hear from Mr. Grey, who hath good intelligence, that our Queen is to go into a nunnery, there to spend her days; and that my Lady Castlemayne is going into France, and is to have a pension of 4000l. a year. This latter I do more believe than the other.

1667-09-04 17:42   To the Duke of York’s play house and there saw “Mustapha” which, the more I see, the more I like; only both Betterton and Harris could not contain from laughing in the midst of a most serious part from the ridiculous mistake of one of the men upon the stage; which I did not like.

1667-09-04 14:10   With my wife and W. Hewer to Bartholomew fayre, and there Polichinelli, where we saw Mrs. Clerke and all her crew; and so to a private house, and sent for a side of pig, and eat it at an acquaintance of W. Hewer’s, where there was some learned physic and chymical books.

1667-09-04 11:20   I heard Alderman Barker’s case of his being abused by the Council of Ireland, touching his lands there: all I observed is the silliness of the King, playing with his dog all the while, and not minding the business, and what he said was mighty weak.

1667-09-04 10:32   Sir W. Coventry told me that he was just come from delivering up his seal and papers to Mr. Wren; and told me he must now take his leave of me as a naval man, but that he shall always bear respect to his friends there, and particularly to myself, with great kindness.

1667-09-03 14:40   I to St. James’s, and there attended the Duke of York about the list of ships that we propose to sell; and here there attended Mr. Wren the first time, who hath not yet, I think, received the Duke of York’s seal and papers.

1667-09-02 22:04   This day Nell, an old tall maid, come to live with us, a cook maid recommended by Mr. Batelier.

1667-09-02 16:50 r Mr. Ashburnham told me that it is only the King’s curiosity, which he usually hath of weighing himself before and after his play, to see how much he loses in weight by playing: and this day he lost 4 lbs.

1667-09-02 16:04   I went to see a great match at tennis, between Prince Rupert and one Captain Cooke, against Bab. May and the elder Chichly; where the King was, and Court; and it seems are the best players at tennis in the nation.

1667-09-02 14:43 r When Mr. Ashburnham was gone, Townsend told me that it is the grooms taking away the King’s linen at the quarter’s end, as their fees, which makes this great want.

1667-09-02 14:30 r Comes in Mr. Townsend; and I was witness of a horrid rateing, which Mr. Ashburnham, as one of the Grooms of the King’s Bedchamber, did give him for want of linen for the King’s person; which he swore was not to be endured, and that the King would not endure.

1667-09-02 14:12   In discourse at dinner concerning the change of men’s humours, Mr. Ashburnham told us that he remembers since the only fruit eaten by the King and Queen at table as the best fruit, was the Katharine payre, though they knew at the time other fruits of France and our own country.

1667-09-02 10:42 r The Duke of York hath chosen Mr. Wren, which I am glad of, he being a very ingenious man; and so Sir W. Coventry says of him, though he knows him little; but particularly commends him for the book he writ in answer to “Harrington’s Oceana,” which I intend to buy.

1667-09-02 10:30   Sir W. Coventry called me down with him to his chamber, and there told me that he is leaving the Duke of York’s service, which I was amazed at. But he tells me that it is not with the least unkindness on the Duke of York’s side.

1667-09-02 09:15   This day is kept in the City as a public fast for the fire this day twelve months: but I was not at church, being commanded, with the rest, to attend the Duke of York.

1667-09-01 19:44 r But, on the contrary, I find she hath bought them for me to pay for them, without my knowledge. This do displease me much; but yet do so much please me better than if she had received them the other way, that I was not much angry.

1667-09-01 19:40   My wife and I to walk in the garden and there scolded a little, I being doubtful that she had received a couple of fine pinners (one of point de Gesne), which I feared she hath from someone or other of a present.

1667-09-01 17:33 r Spent all the afternoon, Pelling, Howe, and I, and my boy, singing of Lock’s response to the Ten Commandments, which he hath set very finely, and was a good while since sung before the King, and spoiled in the performance, which occasioned his printing them for his vindication.

1667-09-01 14:21   Home and by water to dinner, where comes Pelling and young Michell and his wife, whom I have not seen a great while, poor girl, and then comes Mr. Howe, and all dined with me very merry.

1667-09-01 10:10   Blancfort is made Privy-purse to the Duke of York; the Attorney-general is made Chief justice, in the room of my Lord Bridgeman; the Solicitor-general is made Attorney-general; and Sir Edward Turner made Solicitor-general.

1667-09-01 08:31   I to Mrs. Martin’s, where I had two pair of cuffs which I bespoke, and there did sit and talk with her and no mas, ella having aquellos upon her, and here I did see her little girle my goddaughter, which will be pretty.

1667-09-01 07:03   Up, and betimes by water from the Tower, and called at the Old Swan for a glass of strong water, and sent word to have little Michell and his wife come and dine with us today.
