1667-06-30 22:12 r With Creed back again, and to our inne to supper, and then to bed, being both sleepy, but could get no sheets to our bed, only linen to our mouths, and so to sleep, merrily talking of Hawkins and his wife, and troubled that Creed did see so much of my dalliance, though little.

1667-06-30 20:03 r Into the Cherry garden, where we had them fresh gathered, and here met with a young, plain, silly shopkeeper, and his wife, a pretty young woman, the man’s name Hawkins, and I did kiss her.

1667-06-30 19:47 r Back again to Rochester, and there walked to the Cathedral as they were beginning of the service, but would not be seen to stay to church there, besides had no mind, but rather to go to our inne, the White Hart, where we drank.

1667-06-30 19:20 r I find it is true that the Dutch did heele “The Charles” to get her down, and yet run aground twice or thrice, and yet got her safe away, and have her, with a great many good guns in her, which none of our pilots would ever have undertaken.

1667-06-30 18:58 r I find that here, as it hath been in our river, fire-ships, when fitted, have been sunk afterwards, and particularly those here at the Mussle, where they did no good at all.

1667-06-30 18:40 r I went on shore on Upnor side to look upon the end of the chaine; and caused the link to be measured, and it was six inches and one-fourth in circumference.

1667-06-30 17:58 r So to the chaine, and there saw it fast at the end on Upnor side of the River; very fast, and borne up upon the several stages across the River; and where it is broke nobody can tell me.

1667-06-30 17:33 r I do not see that Upnor Castle hath received any hurt by them, though they played long against it; and they themselves shot till they had hardly a gun left upon the carriages, so badly provided they were.

1667-06-30 16:46 r By barge, it raining hard, down to the chaine; and in our way did see the sad wrackes of the poor “Royall Oake,” “James,” and “London;” and several other of our ships by us sunk, and several of the enemy’s, whereof three men-of-war that they could not get off, and so burned.

1667-06-30 15:55 r I was glad, as also it was new to me, to see so many fortifications as I have of late seen, and so up to the top of the Hill, there to look, and could see towards Sheerenesse, to spy the Dutch fleet, but could make out none but one vessel, they being all gone.

1667-06-30 15:50 r Thence to see the batteries made; which, indeed, are very fine, and guns placed so as one would think the River should be very secure.

1667-06-30 14:14 r I and Creed down by boat to Chatham-yard, and to Commissioner Pett’s house, where my Lord Bruncker told me that I should meet with his dinner two dishes of meat, but did not, but however by the help of Mr. Wiles had some beer and ale brought me, and a good piece of roast beef.

1667-06-30 12:10 r At the foot of Rochester bridge, at the landing-place, I met my Lord Bruncker and my Lord Douglas, and all the officers of the soldiers in the town, waiting there for the Duke of York, whom they heard was coming thither this day; by and by comes my Lord Middleton.

1667-06-30 10:03 r With much pleasure, without any stop, got to Rochester about ten of the clock, all the way having mighty pleasant talk of the fate that is over all we do, that it seems as if we were designed in every thing, by land by sea, to undo ourselves.

1667-06-30 03:22   Up about three o’clock, and Creed and I got ourselves ready, and took coach at our gate, it being very fine weather, and the cool of the morning.

1667-06-29 15:22   I home, and there I found Coleman come again to my house, and with my wife in our great chamber, which vexed me, there being a bed therein. I staid there awhile, and then to my study vexed, showing no civility to the man.

1667-06-29 08:50 r I begun to tell Sir W. Coventry of the experience I had of the great brags made by Sir F. Hollis the other day, and the little proof either of the command or interest he had in his men, which Sir W. Pen seconded.

1667-06-29 08:25 r Sir W. Coventry says he do prepare to justify himself, and that he hears that my Lord Chancellor, my Lord Arlington, the Vice Chamberlain and himself are reported all up and down the Coffee houses to be the four sacrifices that must be made to atone the people.

1667-06-29 08:12   To St. James’s, and find Sir W. Coventry and Sir W. Pen, and we to discourse about making up our accounts against the Parliament; Sir W. Coventry did give us the best advice he could for us to provide for our own justification, believing, that they will fall heavily upon us all.

1667-06-28 21:45   We hear that the Dutch are gone down again; and thanks be to God! the trouble they give us this second time is not very considerable.

1667-06-28 14:10   My Lady and Sir Philip Carteret have good discourse of the greatness of the present King of France — what great things he hath done, that a man may pass, at any hour in the night, all over that wild city, with a purse in his hand and no danger.

1667-06-28 11:05   Sir H. Cholmly told me whatever Sir G. Carteret was, he is confident my Lord Anglesey is one of the greatest knaves in the world, which is news to me, but I shall make my use of it.

1667-06-28 08:25   We find the Duke of York and Sir W. Coventry gone this morning, by two o’clock, to Chatham, to come home tonight: and it is fine to observe how both the King and Duke of York have, in their several late journeys to and again, done them in the night for coolnesse.

1667-06-27 21:21   News this tide, that about 80 sail of the Dutch, great and small were seen coming up the river this morning; and this tide some of them to the upper end of the Hope.

1667-06-27 18:30   Home, and find the fellow that come up with my wife, Coleman, last from Brampton, a silly rogue, but one that would seem a gentleman; but I did not stay with him.

1667-06-27 14:30   To the office again, and there I saw the proclamations come out this day for the Parliament to meet the 25th of next month; for which God be praised!

1667-06-27 05:57   Up, full of thought what to do with the little money I have left and my plate, wishing with all my heart that that was all secured.

1667-06-27 03:04   Wakened by Mr. Griffin with a letter from Sir W. Coventry to W. Pen, which W. Pen sent me to see, that the Dutch are come up to the Nore again, and he knows not whether further or no, and would have, therefore, several things done: ships sunk, and I know not what.

1667-06-26 22:41   With my wife and Mercer took coach and to Islington to the Old House, and there eat and drank and sang with great pleasure, and then round by Hackney home with great pleasure, and when come home to bed, my stomach not being well pleased with the cream we had tonight.

1667-06-26 14:58   Such is the want already of coals, and the despair of having any supply, by reason of the enemy’s being abroad, and no fleete of ours to secure, that they are come, as Mr. Kinaston tells me, at this day to 5l. 10s. per chaldron.

1667-06-26 11:21   At White Hall spied Mr. Povy, who tells me, as a great secret, which none knows but himself, that Sir G. Carteret hath parted with his place of Treasurer of the Navy, by consent, to my Lord Anglesey, and is to be Treasurer of Ireland in his stead.

1667-06-26 09:55   Alone to the Swan, and thither come Mr. Kinaston to me, and he and I into a room and there drank and discoursed, and I am mightily pleased with him for a most diligent and methodical man in all his business.

1667-06-26 06:44   Up, and in dressing myself in my dressing chamber comes up Nell, and I did play with her and touch her belly and thing, but did not kiss her.

1667-06-25 19:40   Sir H. Cholmly tells me great news; that this day in Council the King hath declared that he will call his Parliament in thirty days: which is the best news I have heard a great while, and will, if any thing, save the kingdom.

1667-06-25 16:23 r And what men should these be but the boat’s crew of Sir Fretcheville Hollis, who used to brag so much of the goodness and order of his men, and his command over them.

1667-06-25 16:21   Comes Harry Russell from Gravesend, telling us that the money carried down yesterday for the Chest at Chatham had like to have been seized upon yesterday, in the barge there, by seamen, who did beat our watermen.

1667-06-25 15:00   I was told, yesterday, that Mr. Oldenburg, our Secretary at Gresham College, is put into the Tower, for writing newes to a virtuoso in France, with whom he constantly corresponds in philosophical matters; which makes it very unsafe at this time to write, or almost do any thing.

1667-06-25 12:10   By coach home to dinner, being weary indeed of seeing the world, and thinking it high time for me to provide against the foul weather that is certainly coming upon us.

1667-06-25 08:32 r Up to the Duke of York to his chamber, where he seems to be pretty easy, and now and then merry; but yet one may perceive in all their minds there is something of trouble and care, and with good reason.

1667-06-25 07:55   With Sir W. Pen in his new chariot (which indeed is plain, but pretty and more fashionable in shape than any coach he hath, and yet do not cost him, harness and all, above 32l.) to White Hall.

1667-06-24 21:32 r Having done all this discourse, and concluded the kingdom in a desperate condition, we parted; and I to my wife, with whom was Mercer and Betty Michell, poor woman, come with her husband to see us after the death of her little girl.

1667-06-24 20:58   Povy tells me, speaking of the horrid effeminacy of the King, that the King hath taken ten times more care and pains in making friends between my Lady Castlemayne and Mrs. Stewart, when they have fallen out, than ever he did to save his kingdom.

1667-06-24 09:10   Up, and to the office, where much business upon me by the coming of people of all sorts about the dispatch of one business or other of the fire-ships, or other ships to be set out now.

1667-06-23 16:39 r The great misery the City and kingdom is like to suffer for want of coals in a little time is visible and, is feared, will breed a mutiny; for we are not in any prospect to command the sea for our colliers, but rather the Dutch may go and burn all our colliers at Newcastle.

1667-06-23 16:12 r Captain Cocke says that he hears it is come to it now, that the King will try what he can soon do for a peace; and if he cannot, that then he will cast all upon the Parliament to do as they see fit: and in doing so, perhaps, he may save us all.

1667-06-23 15:04   Mr. Bodham and I to see the batterys newly raised; which, indeed, are good works to command the River below the ships that are sunk, but not above them. It is a sad sight to see so many good ships there sunk in the River, while we would be thought to be masters of the sea.

1667-06-23 12:58   After church time comes my wife and Sir W. Pen his lady and daughter; and Mrs. Markham and Captain Hannum, by invitation and dined with me, they as good as inviting themselves. I confess I hate their company and tricks, and so had no great pleasure in, but a good dinner lost.

1667-06-22 21:33   The King did tell Sir W. Pen himself, which is so, I was told, here in the City, that the City, hath lent him 10,000l, to be laid out towards securing of the River of Thames; which, methinks, is a very poor thing, that we should be induced to borrow by such mean sums.

1667-06-22 20:41   I hear the Duke of Cambridge is dead; which is a great loss to the nation, having, I think, never an heyre male now of the King’s or Duke’s to succeed to the Crown.

1667-06-22 19:06 r That the Dutch did take her with a boat of nine men, who found not a man on board her, and her laying so near them was a main temptation to them to come on; and presently a man went up and struck her flag and jacke, and a trumpeter sounded upon her “Joan’s placket is torn.”

1667-06-22 19:04   Capt. Hart and Haywood told me about the taking of “The Royal Charles;” that nothing but carelessness lost the ship, for they might have saved her the very tide that the Dutch come up if they would have but used means: and that the want of boats plainly lost all the other ships.

1667-06-22 15:44   To Sir W. Pen’s, there to talk with Mrs. Lowther, and by and by we hearing Mercer and my boy singing at my house, making exceeding good music, to the joy of my heart, that I should be the master of it.

1667-06-22 13:22 r Much talk with Mr. Phillips about country business, among others that there is no way for me to purchase any severall lands in Brampton, without much trouble and cost, and, it may be, not do it neither, so that there is no more ground to be laid to our Brampton house.

1667-06-22 12:10   Home to dinner, where Mr. Lewes Phillips, by invitation of my wife, comes, he coming up to town with her in the coach, and she expected another gentleman, and I perceive the feast was for him, though she do not say it, but by some mistake he come not, so there was a dinner lost.

1667-06-22 08:04   Up, and to my office, where busy, and there comes Mrs. Daniel; and it is strange how merely the putting my hand to her belly through her coats did make me do.

1667-06-21 19:03   Sir H. Cholmly tells me the Court is as mad as ever; and that the night the Dutch burned our ships the King did sup with my Lady Castlemayne, at the Duchess of Monmouth’s, and there were all mad in hunting of a poor moth.

1667-06-21 16:11   Comes news from Harwich that the Dutch fleet are all in sight, near 100 sail great and small, they think, coming towards them; where, they think, they shall be able to oppose them.

1667-06-21 12:14   Home, where my wife shows me a letter from her father, who is going over sea, and this afternoon would take his leave of her. I sent him by her three Jacobuses in gold, having real pity for him and her.

1667-06-20 21:50   My wife and I to walk and talk again about our gold, which I am not quiet in my mind to be safe, and therefore will think of some way to remove it, it troubling me very much.

1667-06-20 16:43 r And how unreasonable it is to expect they should be willing to lend their ships, and lay out 2 or 300l. a man to fit their ships for new voyages, when we have not paid them half of what we owe them for their old services!

1667-06-20 16:41   I did treat with, and in the end agree; but by some kind of compulsion, with the owners of six merchant ships, to serve the King as men-of-war. But, Lord! to see how against the hair it is with these men and every body to trust us and the King.

1667-06-20 13:35 r Here dined Mercer with us, and after dinner she cut my hair, and then I into my closet and there slept a little, as I do now almost every day after dinner; and then, after dallying a little with Nell, which I am ashamed to think of, away to the office.

1667-06-20 12:32   Home to dinner, and there my wife and I very good friends; the care of my gold being somewhat over, considering it was in their hands that have as much cause to secure it as myself almost, and so if they will be mad, let them.

1667-06-20 10:00   Mr. Barber come to me (one of the clerks of the Ticket office) to get me to sign some tickets, and told me that all the discourse yesterday, about that part of the town where he was, was that Mr. Pett and I were in the Tower; and I did hear the same before.

1667-06-19 20:10 r Which put me into such trouble, that I was almost mad about it, and presently cast about, how to have it back again to secure it here, the times being a little better now.

1667-06-19 20:07 r My father and she did it on Sunday, when they were gone to church, in open daylight, in the midst of the garden; where, for aught they knew, many eyes might see them.

1667-06-19 20:04 r I and my wife to talk, who did give me so bad an account of her and my father’s method in burying of our gold, that made me mad: and she herself is not pleased with it, she believing that my sister knows of it.

1667-06-19 19:15   Hearing by Yorke, the carrier, that my wife is coming to town, I did make haste home to see her, that she might not find me abroad, it being the first minute I have been abroad since yesterday was se’ennight.

1667-06-19 17:34 r I away back with my books and papers; and when I got into the Court it was pretty to see how people gazed upon me, that I thought myself obliged to salute people and to smile, lest they should think I was a prisoner too.

1667-06-19 17:25 r They caused Sir Richard Browne to read over his minutes; and then my Lord Arlington moved that they might be put into my hands to put into form, I being more acquainted with such business; and they were so.

1667-06-19 17:10 r After having heard Pett for an hour, they bid him withdraw. I all this while showing him no respect, for which God forgive me! for I mean no hurt to him, but only find that these Lords are upon their own purgation, and it is necessary I should be so in behalf of the office.

1667-06-19 15:58 r Peter Pett called in, with the Lieutenant of the Tower. His charge was chiefly the not carrying up of the great ships, and the using of the boats in carrying away his goods; to which he answered very sillily, though his faults to me seem only great omissions.

1667-06-19 15:40 r After Sir W. Coventry’s telling them what orders His Royal Highness had made for the safety of the Medway, I told them to their full content what we had done, and showed them our letters.

1667-06-19 15:25   I am called in to a large Committee of the Council: present the Duke of Albemarle, Anglesey, Arlington, Ashly, Carteret, Duncomb, Coventry, Ingram, Clifford, Lauderdale, Morrice, Manchester, Craven, Carlisle, Bridgewater.

1667-06-19 13:10   Comes an order from Sir R. Browne, commanding me this afternoon to attend the Council-board, with all my books and papers touching the Medway. I was ready to fear some mischief to myself, though it appears most reasonable that it is to inform them about Commissioner Pett.

1667-06-18 22:03   I hear this day poor Michell’s child is dead.

1667-06-18 21:11   Sir G. Carteret tells me he is not sure that the King of France will not annoy us this year, but that the Court seems to reckon upon it as a thing certain, for that is all that I and most people are afeard of this year.

1667-06-18 20:20   Great news tonight of the blowing up of one of the Dutch greatest ships, while a Council of War was on board: the latter part, I doubt, is not so, it not being confirmed since; but the former, that they had a ship blown up, is said to be true.

1667-06-18 15:15   To the office, and by and by word was brought me that Commissioner Pett is brought to the Tower, and there laid up close prisoner; which puts me into a fright, lest they may do the same with us as they do with him.

1667-06-17 22:14 r Captain Cocke gone, I to my business again, and then home to supper and to bed. I have lately played the fool much with our Nell, in playing with her breasts.

1667-06-17 21:10   Captain Cocke says the King and Court are all troubled, and the gates of the Court were shut up upon the first coming of the Dutch to us, but they do mind the business no more than ever.

1667-06-17 17:49   Sir Fretcheville Hollis, Sir W. Batten and W. Pen say, proves a very wind-fucker, as Sir W. B. terms him, and the other called him a conceited, idle, prating, lying fellow.

1667-06-17 17:38   At the office all the afternoon, where every moment business of one kind or other about the fire-ships and other businesses, most of them vexatious for want of money, the commanders all complaining that, if they miss to pay their men a night, they run away.

1667-06-16 22:22   I to the garden, and there dallied a while all alone with Mrs. Markham, and then home to my chamber and to read and write, and then to supper and to bed.

1667-06-16 12:57   Talking of these straits we are in, Roger Pepys tells me that my Lord Arlington did the last week take up 12,000l. in gold, which is very likely, for all was taken up that could be.

1667-06-16 09:10   To the office to look out several of my old letters to Sir W. Coventry in order to the preparing for justifying this office in our frequent foretelling the want of money.

1667-06-15 22:10   Home and to my flageolet. Played with pleasure, but with a heavy heart, only it pleased me to think how it may please God I may live to spend my time in the country with plainness and pleasure, though but with little glory.

1667-06-15 21:17 r He had one of his bags broke, through his breeches, and some pieces dropped out, not many, for he ’light, and took them up, and could find no more. But I am not able to tell how many, which troubles me, but the joy of having the greatest part safe makes me bear with it.

1667-06-15 21:15   Comes, unexpectedly so soon, Mr. Gibson, who left my wife well, and all got down well with them, but not with himself, which I was afeard of, and cannot blame him, but must myself be wiser against another time.

1667-06-15 15:47   Poor Betty Michell, whom I love, sent to tell my wife her child was dying, which I am troubled for, poor girl.

1667-06-15 10:25 r I hear that Commissioner Pett will be found the first man that began to remove; he is much spoken against, and Bruncker is complained of and reproached for discharging the men of the great ships heretofore.

1667-06-15 10:22   Purser Tyler comes and tells me that he being at all the passages in this business at Chatham, he says there have been horrible miscarriages, such as we shall shortly hear of: that the want of boats hath undone us.

1667-06-14 22:33 r Home to my flageolet, my heart being at pretty good ease by a letter from my wife, brought by Saunders, that my father and wife got well last night to their Inne and out again this morning, and Gibson’s being got safe to Caxton at twelve last night.

1667-06-14 22:10 r Come home Sir W. Batten and W. Pen, who only can tell me that they have placed guns at Woolwich and Deptford, and sunk some ships below Woolwich and Blackewall, and are in hopes that they will stop the enemy’s coming up.

1667-06-14 13:32 r We discoursed of Tom of the Wood, a fellow that lives like a hermit near Woolwich, who affirms that he was by at the justice’s when some did accuse him there for it, did foretell the burning of the City, and now says that a greater desolation is at hand.

1667-06-14 12:42 r People make nothing of talking treason in the streets openly: as, that we are bought and sold, and governed by Papists, and that we are betrayed by people about the King, and shall be delivered up to the French, and I know not what.

1667-06-14 12:04 r Mr. Hater tells me at my Lord Chancellor’s they have cut down the trees before his house and broke his windows; and a gibbet either set up before or painted upon his gate, and these words writ: “Three sights to be seen; Dunkirke, Tangier, and a barren Queene.”

1667-06-14 11:45 r D. Gawden did tell me yesterday, that the day before at the Council they were ready to fall together by the ears at the Council-table, arraigning one another of being guilty of the counsel that brought us into this misery, by laying up all the great ships.

1667-06-14 11:20 r I am left alone here at the office; and the truth is, I am glad my station is to be here, near my own home and out of danger, yet in a place of doing the King good service.

1667-06-14 10:56 r Some of the Cambridge’s men come up from Portsmouth, by order from Sir Fretcheville Hollis, who boasted to us the other day that he had sent for 50, and would be hanged if 100 did not come up that would do as much as twice the number of other men.

1667-06-14 10:32 r Several seamen come tell me that, if I would get their tickets paid, they would go and do all they could against the Dutch; but otherwise they would not venture being killed, and lose all they have already fought for: so that I was forced to try what I could do to get them paid.

1667-06-14 09:05 r A man of Mr. Gawden’s tells me of worst consequence is, that he himself did hear many Englishmen on board the Dutch ships speaking to one another; and that they did cry, “We did heretofore fight for tickets; now we fight for dollars!” and did ask how such and such a one did.

1667-06-14 08:15   Mr. Fryer tells me there are several Frenchmen and Flemish ships in the River, with passes from the Duke of York for carrying of prisoners, that ought to be parted from the rest of the ships, their powder taken, lest they do fire themselves when the enemy comes, and so spoil us.

1667-06-13 23:40 r I made my will also this day, and did give all I had equally between my father and wife, and left copies of it in each of Mr. Hater and W. Hewer’s hands, who both witnessed the will, and so to supper and then to bed.

1667-06-13 22:58 r We hear that the fleet in the Hope is not come up any higher the last flood; and Sir W. Batten tells me that ships are provided to sink in the River, about Woolwich, that will prevent their coming up higher if they should attempt it.

1667-06-13 22:10 r Comes Mr. Hudson  and tells me that he come from Chatham at five o’clock, and saw “The Royal James,” “Oake,” and “London,” burnt by the enemy with their fire-ships: that two or three men-of-war come up with them, and made no more of Upnor Castle’s shooting, than of a fly.

1667-06-13 20:55 r They do think verily that the French, being come down with his army to Dunkirke, it is to invade us, and that we shall be invaded.

1667-06-13 20:49 r Comes Mr. Pelling to the office, and tells me that never were people so dejected as they are in the City all over at this day; and do talk most loudly, even treason; as, that we are bought and sold — that we are betrayed by the Papists, and others, about the King.

1667-06-13 19:47 r I have made a girdle, by which, with some trouble, I do carry about me 300l. in gold about my body, that I may not be without something in case I should be surprised: for I think, in any nation but our’s, people that appear so faulty as we, would have their throats cut.

1667-06-13 19:32 r I sent for my cousin Sarah and her husband; and I did deliver them my chest of writings about Brampton, and my brother Tom’s papers, and my journalls, which I value much; and did send my two silver flagons to Kate Joyce’s: that so, being scattered, something might be saved.

1667-06-13 17:10 r The King and Duke of York up and down all the day here and there: some time on Tower Hill, where the City militia was; where the King did make a speech to them, that they should venture themselves no further than he would himself.

1667-06-13 12:05 r I did resolve to send Mr. Gibson away after my wife with another 1000 pieces, under colour of an express to Sir Jeremy Smith; who is, as I hear, with some ships at Newcastle; which I did really send to him, and may, possibly, prove of good use to the King.

1667-06-13 11:55 r Every minute some one or other calls for this or that order; and so I forced to be at the office about the fire-ships which are to be suddenly fitted out.

1667-06-13 11:28 r I must keep the silver by me, which sometimes I think to fling into the house of office, and then again know not how I shall come by it, if we be made to leave the office.

1667-06-13 10:50 r W. Hewer hath been at the banker’s, and hath got 500l. out of Backewell’s hands of his own money; but they are so called upon that they will be all broke. And their answer is, “It is payable at twenty days — when the days are out, we will pay you.”

1667-06-13 10:10 r This put me into such a fear, that I resolved of my father’s and wife’s going into the country; and, at two hours’ warning, they did go by the coach, with about 1300l. in gold in their night-bag. Pray God give them good passage, and good care to hide it when they come home!

1667-06-13 08:04 r Another fleet is come up into the Hope. Upon which news the King and Duke of York have been below since four o’clock in the morning, to command the sinking of ships at Barking-Creeke, and other places, to stop their coming up higher.

1667-06-13 06:20   No sooner up but hear the sad news confirmed of the Royall Charles being taken by them, and now in fitting by them — which Pett should have carried up higher by our several orders, and deserves, therefore, to be hanged for not doing it — and turning several others.

1667-06-12 21:40 r I do fear some violence will be offered to this office, where all I have in the world is; and resolved upon sending it away — sometimes into the country — sometimes my father to lie in town, and have the gold with him at Sarah Giles’s.

1667-06-12 17:22 r Home, where all our hearts do now ake; for the news is true, that the Dutch have broke the chaine and burned our ships, and particularly “The Royal Charles,” other particulars I know not, but most sad to be sure.

1667-06-12 15:15 r To White Hall to hear the truth of it; and there, going up the back-stairs, I did hear some lackies speaking of sad news come to Court, saying, that hardly anybody in the Court but do look as if he cried.

1667-06-12 14:24 r When I come to Sir W: Coventry’s chamber, I find him abroad; but his clerk, Powell, do tell me that ill news is come to Court of the Dutch breaking the Chaine at Chatham; which struck me to the heart.

1667-06-12 13:50   I met Sir W. Coventry’s boy; and in his letter find that the Dutch had made no motion since their taking Sheernesse; and the Duke of Albemarle writes that all is safe as to the great ships against any assault, the boom and chaine being so fortified; which put my heart into joy.

1667-06-11 21:33 r Considering the soldiers drawn out to Chatham and elsewhere, looks as if they had a design to ruin the City and give it up to be undone; which, I hear, makes the sober citizens to think very sadly of things.

1667-06-11 21:30   A great deal of serious talk with my wife about the sad state we are in, and especially from the beating up of drums for the trainbands upon pain of death to appear in arms tomorrow morning with bullet and powder, and money to supply themselves with victuals for a fortnight.

1667-06-11 16:28 r Sir W. Coventry, in his letter to us, says he do not doubt but at this time, under an invasion, as he owns it to be, the King may, by law, take any man’s goods.

1667-06-11 16:25   To our business, hiring some fire-ships, and receiving every hour almost letters from Sir W. Coventry, calling for more fire-ships; and an order from Council to enable us to take any man’s ships.

1667-06-11 15:04   By W. Hewer’s lucky advice, went to Mr. Fenn, and did get him to pay me above 400l. of my wages, and W. Hewer received it for me, and brought it home this night.

1667-06-11 11:12   Pett writes us word that Sheernesse is lost last night, after two or three hours’ dispute. The enemy hath possessed himself of that place; which is very sad, and puts us into great fears of Chatham.

1667-06-11 09:10   I to the office, where Bruncker come to us, who is just now going to Chatham upon a desire of Commissioner Pett’s, who is in a very fearful stink for fear of the Dutch, and desires help for God and the King and kingdom’s sake.

1667-06-10 21:34   I homeward, as long as it was light reading Mr. Boyle’s book of Hydrostatics, which is a most excellent book as ever I read, and I will take much pains to understand him through if I can, the doctrine being very useful.

1667-06-10 18:34   I went off to an Ostend man-of-war, just now come up, who met the Dutch fleet, who took three ships that he come convoying hither from him says they are as low as the Nore, or thereabouts.

1667-06-10 17:42   The Dutch are fallen down from the Hope and Shell-haven as low as Sheernesse, and we do plainly at this time hear the guns play. Yet I do not find the Duke of Albemarle intends to go thither, but stays here tonight.

1667-06-10 16:53   Down to Gravesend, where I find the Duke of Albemarle just come, with a great many idle lords and gentlemen, with their pistols and fooleries; and the bulwarke not able to have stood half an hour had they come up.

1667-06-10 14:15   Took boat and down to Greenwich, where I find the stairs full of people, there being a great riding there today for a man, the constable of the town, whose wife beat him.

1667-06-10 10:40   Down to Deptford, and pitched upon ships and set men at work: but, Lord! to see how backwardly things move at this pinch, notwithstanding that, by the enemy’s being now come up as high as almost the Hope, Sir J. Minnes hath sent up the money.

1667-06-10 08:05   W. Batten, W. Pen, and I to St. James’s; where the Duke of York gone this morning betimes, to send away some men down to Chatham. So we three to White Hall, and met Sir W. Coventry, who presses all that is possible for fire-ships.

1667-06-10 06:50   Up; and news brought us that, the Dutch are come up as high as the Nore; and more pressing orders for fireships.

1667-06-09 21:22   Being come home I find an order come for the getting some fire-ships presently to annoy the Dutch, who are in the King’s Channel, and expected up higher. So W. Batten and W. Pen being come this evening from their country houses to town we did issue orders about it.

1667-06-09 20:27   Took boat and up, all alone, as high as Barne Elmes, and there took a turn; and then to my boat again, and home, reading and making an end of the book I lately bought a merry satyr called “The Visions,” translated from Spanish by L’Estrange.

1667-06-09 10:20 r My Lord Barkeley wanting some maps, and Sir W. Coventry recommending the six maps of England that are bound up for the pocket, I did offer to present my Lord with them, which he accepted: and so I will send them him.

1667-06-09 10:08   In comes my Lord Barkeley, who is going down to Harwich to look after the militia: and the Duke of Monmouth, and with him a great many young Hectors, the Lord Chesterfield, my Lord Mandeville, and others: but to little purpose, but to debauch the country women thereabouts.

1667-06-09 07:32   Up, and by water to White Hall, and so walked to St. James’s, where I hear that the Duke of Cambridge, who was given over long since by the Doctors, is now likely to recover; for which God be praised!

1667-06-08 21:40   The news is confirmed that the Dutch are off of Harwich but had done nothing last night. The King hath sent down my Lord of Oxford to raise the countries there and all the Westerne barges are taken up to make a bridge over the River, about the Hope, for horse to cross the River.

1667-06-08 13:23   Home to dinner, where our dinner a ham of French bacon, boiled with pigeons, an excellent dish. Here dined with us only W. Hewer and his mother.

1667-06-08 11:48   To the office, where all the news this morning is that the Dutch are come with a fleet of eighty sail to Harwich, and that guns were heard plain by Sir W. Rider’s people at Bednall Greene, all yesterday even.

1667-06-07 22:00   My head full of thoughts how to keep if I can some part of my wages as Surveyor of the Victualling, which I see must now come to be taken away among the other places that have been occasioned by this war, and the rather because I have of late an inclination to keep a coach.

1667-06-07 15:22   Ever since my drinking, two days ago, some very coole drink at Sir W. Coventry’s table I have been full of wind and with some pain, and I was afraid last night that it would amount to much, but, blessed be God! I find that the worst is past.

1667-06-06 16:33   Mr. Pierce to me about some business, and tells me that the Duke of Cambridge is yet living, but every minute expected to die, and is given over by all people, which indeed is a sad loss.

1667-06-06 13:45 r Here as merry as in so false a place, and where I must dissemble my hatred, I could be, and after dinner my father and wife to a play, and I to my office.

1667-06-06 12:30   With my father and wife to Sir W. Pen’s to dinner, which they invited us to out of their respect to my father, as a stranger; though I know them as false as the devil himself, and that it is only that they think it fit to oblige me.

1667-06-05 22:10   My father, blessed be God! finds great ease by his new steel trusse, which he put on yesterday.

1667-06-05 19:15   Sir G. Carteret showed me a gentleman who hath been sent for out of Lincolneshire, that the Council have laid by the heels here for saying that a man and his wife are but one person, and so ought to pay but 12d. for both to the Poll Bill; by which others were led to do the like.

1667-06-05 17:32   Sir G. Carteret and I to my Lord Crew. Here they talked of my Lord Hinchingbroke’s match with Lord Burlington’s daughter, which is now gone a pretty way forward, and to great content, which I am infinitely glad of.

1667-06-05 13:58   I to St. James’s, where we all met at Sir W. Coventry’s chamber, and dined and talked of our business, he being a most excellent man. Here a very good and neat dinner, after the French manner, and good discourse.

1667-06-04 22:05 r I fell to read a book (Boyle’s Hydrostatiques) aloud in my chamber and let my wife talk, till she was tired and vexed that I would not hear her, and so become friends.

1667-06-04 21:45   Home, and there to sing and pipe with my wife, and that being done, she fell all of a sudden to discourse about her clothes and my humours in not suffering her to wear them as she pleases, and grew to high words between us.

1667-06-04 14:26 r And besides, I am in danger of parting with one of my places, which relates to the Victualling, that brings me by accident in 800l. a year, that is, 300l. from the King and 500l. from D. Gawden. I ought to be well contented to forbear awhile, and therefore I am contented.

1667-06-04 14:24 r I am a little sorry that I cannot presently have it, because I am pretty full in my mind of keeping a coach; but yet, when I think on it again, the Dutch and French both at sea, and we poor, and still out of order, I know not yet what turns there may be.

1667-06-04 14:22   Comes Mr. Commander to me and tells me, after all, that I cannot have a lease of the ground for my coach-house and stable, till a suit in law be ended, about the end of the old stable now standing, which they and I would have pulled down to make a better way for a coach.

1667-06-03 21:12 r Eat and drank a little, and then to walk up and down the garden, reflecting upon the bad management of things, compared with what it was in the late rebellious times, when men, some for fear, and some for religion, minded their business, which none now do, by being void of both.

1667-06-03 19:20   Creed and I by water up to Fox Hall, and over against it stopped, thinking to see some Cock-fighting; but it was just being done, and, therefore, back again to the other side, and to Spring Garden.

1667-06-03 17:11   Creed and I waited in the Treasury-chamber, where we saw the Country Receivers and Accountants for money come to attend; and one of them, a brisk young fellow, with his hat cocked like a fool behind, as the present fashion among the blades is, committed to the Serjeant.

1667-06-03 14:35 r The Dutch are known to be abroad with eighty sail of ships of war, and twenty fire-ships; and the French come into the Channell with twenty sail of men-of-war, and five fireships, while we have not a ship at sea to do them any hurt with.

1667-06-03 14:25   To Deptford, and there find them just sat down. And so I down with them; and we had a good dinner of plain meat, and good company at our table: among others, my good Mr. Evelyn, with whom, after dinner, I stepped aside, and talked upon the present posture of our affairs.

1667-06-03 11:04   To Westminster Hall and there walked with Sir William Doyly who did lay a wager with me, the Treasurership would be in one hand before Christmas: on which we did lay a poll of ling, a brace of carps, and a pottle of wine; and Sir W. Pen and Mr. Scowen to be at the eating of them.

1667-06-03 10:10   I met Mr. Mills, our parson, whom I went back with to bring him to W. Coventry, to give him the form of a qualification for the Duke of York to sign to, to enable him to have two livings: which was a service I did, but much against my will, for a lazy, fat priest.

1667-06-02 19:58   I took boat at the Old Swan, and there up the river all alone as high as Putney almost, and back again, all the way reading Mr. Boyle’s book of Colours, which is so chymical, that I can understand but little of it, but understand enough to see that he is a most excellent man.

1667-06-02 05:52   Up betimes and down to my chamber without trimming myself or putting on clean linen, thinking only to keep to my chamber and do business today, but I find that without being shaved I am not fully awake, nor ready to settle to business, and so was fain to go up and dress myself.

1667-06-01 17:10   To the office where, after a little nap, I fell to business and did very much with infinite joy to myself as it always is to me when I have dispatched much business, and therefore it troubles me to see how hard it is for me to settle to it sometimes when my mind is upon pleasure.

1667-06-01 12:15 r They say the Duke of Monmouth is going over only as a traveller, not to engage on either side, but only to see the campagne, which will be becoming him much more than to live whoreing and rogueing, as he now do.

1667-06-01 12:02   I to the office, where we sat all the morning; where we have news that our peace with Spaine, as to trade, is wholly concluded, and we are to furnish him with some men for Flanders against the French.

1667-06-01 08:04   There comes to me Mr. Commander, whom I employ about hiring of some ground behind the office, for the building of me a stable and coach-house. I do find it necessary for me, both in respect to honour and the profit of it also, to keep a coach, and therefore will do it.
