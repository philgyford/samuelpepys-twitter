1667-01-08 22:13  To supper, and then saw the catalogue of my books, which my brother had wrote out, now perfectly alphabeticall, and so to bed.

1667-01-08 21:47   Sir W. Coventry hath resigned his place of Commissioner of the Navy, the thing he hath often told me that he had a mind to do, but I am surprised to think that he hath done it, and am full of thoughts all this evening after I heard it what may be the consequences of it to me.

1667-01-08 19:32 r Which if true is excellent invention to clear both the Duchesse from poison or the Duke from lying with her.

1667-01-08 19:30   Sir Richard Ford tells us that upon opening the body of my Lady Denham it is said that they found a vessel about her matrix which had never been broke by her husband, that caused all pains in her body.

1667-01-07 21:45   To write over fair my vows for this year, and then to supper, and to bed. In great peace of mind having now done it, and brought myself into order again and a resolution of keeping it, and having entered my journall to this night, so to bed, my eyes failing me with writing.

1667-01-07 19:15 r So home, it being the last play now I am to see till a fortnight hence, I being from the last night entered into my vows for the year coming on.

1667-01-07 18:02   To the Duke’s house, and saw “Macbeth,” which, though I saw it lately, yet appears a most excellent play in all respects, but especially in divertisement, though it be a deep tragedy; which is a strange perfection in a tragedy, it being most proper here, and suitable.

1667-01-07 12:26   My Lord Bruncker tells me how Mr. Henry Howard, of Norfolke, hath given our Royal Society all his grandfather’s library: which noble gift they value at 1000l; and gives them accommodation to meet in at his house, Arundell House, they being now disturbed at Gresham College.

1667-01-07 12:03 r The Duke of York is troubled for her; but hath declared he will never have another public mistress again; which I shall be glad of, and would the King would do the like.

1667-01-07 12:01   My Lord Bruncker tells me that my Lady Denham is at last dead. Some suspect her poisoned, but it will be best known when her body is opened, which will be to-day, she dying yesterday morning.

1667-01-06 18:15 r Thence all along Thames Street, and so up by London Wall, by Blackfriars, to Ludgate; and thence to Bridewell, which I find to have been heretofore an extraordinary good house; and so to look about St. Bride’s church and my father’s house, and so walked home.

1667-01-06 16:10   Young Michell and I, it being an excellent frosty day to walk, did walk out, he showing me the baker’s house in Pudding Lane, where the late great fire begun.

1667-01-06 14:33 r Here come also Mr. Howe to dine with me, and we had a good dinner and good merry discourse with much pleasure, I enjoying myself mightily to have friends at my table.

1667-01-06 12:53   Betty Michell and her husband come by invitation to dine with us, and, she I find the same as ever (which I was afraid of the contrary) notwithstanding what yo haze ella hazer cum ego gthe last Sunday but one, when we were abroad together.

1667-01-06 06:20   I lay with much pain in my head most of the night, and very unquiet, partly by my drinking before I went out too great a draught of sack, and partly my eyes being still very sore.

1667-01-05 17:52   With my wife to the Duke’s house, and there saw “Mustapha,” a most excellent play for words and design as ever I did see. I had seen it before but forgot it, so it was wholly new to me, which is the pleasure of my not committing these things to my memory.

1667-01-05 12:10   Thinking to have been taken home, and my wife (according to appointment yesterday), by my Lord Bruncker, to dinner, but he had forgot it, at which I was glad, being glad of avoiding the occasion of inviting him again, and being forced to invite his doxy, Mrs. Williams.

1667-01-04 22:47 r I do observe Mr. Lowther to be a pretty gentleman, and too good for Peg; and, by the way, Peg Pen seems mightily to be kind to me; but I believe not a little troubled to see my plenty, and was much troubled to hear the song I sung, “The New Droll” — it touching him home.

1667-01-04 22:44 r To cards, and then to sing and talk, and at night to sup; and, last of all, to have a flaggon of ale and apples, drunk out of a wood cupp, as a Christmas draught, made all merry; and they full of admiration at my plate, particularly my flaggons (which, indeed, are noble).

1667-01-04 14:50 r I did make them all gaze to see themselves served so nobly in plate, and a neat dinner, indeed, though but of seven dishes. Mighty merry I was and made them all, and they mightily pleased.

1667-01-04 13:07   Anon comes our company; my Lord Bruncker, Sir W. Pen, his lady, and Pegg, and her servant, Mr. Lowther, my Lady Batten (Sir W. Batten being forced to dine at Sir R. Ford’s), Mr. Turner and his wife. Here I had good room for ten, and no more would my table have held well.

1667-01-02 22:03   Home and to my chamber to set down my journal, and then to thinking upon establishing my vows against the next year, and so to supper and to bed.

1667-01-02 18:49   By link, walked home, it being mighty cold but dry, yet bad walking because very slippery with the frost and treading.

1667-01-02 17:45   To the King’s House, and there saw “The Custome of the Country,” wherein Knipp does the Widow well; but, of all the plays that ever I did see, the worst, having neither plot, language, nor anything in the earth that is acceptable; only Knipp sings a little song admirably.

1667-01-02 13:37   To the Rose Tavern, while Doll Lane come to me, and we did biber a good deal de vino, et jo did give ella 12 solidos para comprar ella some gans for a new ano’s gift. I did tocar et no mas su cosa, but in fit time and place jo creo que je pouvais faire whatever I would con ella.

1667-01-02 11:50   Up to the Painted Chamber, and there heard a conference between the House of Lords and Commons about the Wine Patent; which I was exceeding glad to be at, because of my hearing exceeding good discourses, but especially from the Commons.

1667-01-02 10:40   I find the Court full of great apprehensions of the French, who have certainly shipped landsmen, great numbers, at Brest; and most of our people here guess his design for Ireland. We have orders to send all the ships we can possible to the Downes.

1667-01-02 09:10   Up, I, and walked to White Hall to attend the Duke of York, as usual. My wife up, and with Mrs. Pen to walk in the fields to frost-bite themselves.

1667-01-01 14:24   Home to dinner, where the best powdered goose that ever I eat.

1667-01-01 12:55   To the ’Change a little, where Mr. James Houblon and I walked a good while speaking of our ill condition in not being able to set out a fleet (we doubt) this year, and the certain ill effect that must bring, which is lamentable.

1667-01-01 08:24   Lay long, being a bitter, cold, frosty day, the frost being now grown old, and the Thames covered with ice.
