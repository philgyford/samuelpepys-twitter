1667-01-31 22:11 r Nobody knows who commands the fleet next year, or, indeed, whether we shall have a fleet or no. Great preparations in Holland and France, and the French have lately taken Antego from us, which vexes us.

1667-01-31 22:08 r The imperfection of the Poll Bill, which must be mended before they rise, there being several horrible oversights to the prejudice of the King, is a certain sign of the care anybody hath of the King’s business.

1667-01-31 22:05   Thus the month ends: myself in very good health and content of mind in my family. All our heads full in the office at this dividing of the Comptroller’s duty, so that I am in some doubt how it may prove to intrench upon my benefits, but it cannot be much.

1667-01-31 16:10   I met on the ’Change with Captain Cocke, who tells me that he hears new certainty of the business of Madrid, how our Embassador and the French met, and says that two or three of my Lord’s men, and twenty one of the French men are killed, but nothing at Court of it.

1667-01-30 22:03 r Home to cards awhile, and had opportunity para besar Mercer several times, and so to bed.

1667-01-30 20:36 r Walked home, it being a little moonshine and fair weather, and so into the garden, and, with Mercer, sang till my wife put me in mind of its being a fast day; and so I was sorry for it, and stopped.

1667-01-30 18:27   My wife and I and Mercer and Barker to little Michell’s, walked, with some neats’ tongues and cake and wine, and there sat with the little couple with great pleasure, and talked and eat and drank, and saw their little house, which is very pretty.

1667-01-30 12:10   I all the morning at my chamber making up my month’s accounts, which I did to my thorough content, and find myself but a small gainer this month, having no manner of profits, but just my salary, but, blessed be God! that I am able to save out of that, living as I do.

1667-01-29 19:38   I perceive my Lord Bruncker is a rotten-hearted, false man as any else I know, even as Sir W. Pen himself, and, therefore, I must beware of him accordingly, and I hope I shall.

1667-01-29 15:50   There is news upon the Exchange today, that my Lord Sandwich’s coach and the French Embassador’s at Madrid, meeting and contending for the way, they shot my Lord’s postilion and another man dead; and that we have killed 25 of theirs, and that my Lord is well.

1667-01-29 11:50   Up to the office all the morning, where Sir W. Pen and I look much askewe one upon another, though afterward business made us speak friendly enough, but yet we hate one another.

1667-01-28 22:10   I sent for Mercer, and began to teach her “It is decreed,” which will please me well, and so after supper and reading a little, and my wife’s cutting off my hair short, which is grown too long upon my crown of my head, I to bed.

1667-01-28 13:20   I met in Westminster Hall Sir W. Batten and W. Pen, and the latter since our falling out the other day do look mighty reservedly upon me, and still he shall do so for me, for I will be hanged before I seek to him, unless I see I need it.

1667-01-28 12:50   I hear from Mr. Hayes that Prince Rupert is very bad still, and so bad, that he do now yield to be trepanned. It seems, as Dr. Clerke also tells me, it is a clap of the pox which he got about twelve years ago, and hath eaten to his head and come through his scull.

1667-01-28 12:14 r Much work I find there is to do in the two Houses in a little time, and much difference there is between the two Houses in many things to be reconciled; as in the Bill for examining our accounts; Lord Mordaunt’s Bill for building the City, and several others.

1667-01-28 12:04   To Westminster, where I spent the morning at the Lords’ House door, to hear the conference between the two Houses about my Lord Mordaunt, of which there was great expectation, many hundreds of people coming to hear it.

1667-01-27 21:50   My wife tells me Mr. Frampton is gone to sea, and so she lost her labour today in thinking to hear him preach, which I am sorry for.

1667-01-27 20:40 r So there we parted at their house, and he walked almost home with me, and then I home and to supper.

1667-01-27 20:15 r We home by water, a fine moonshine and warm night. I did get her hand to me under my cloak and did oter sa gans, but ella ne voudroit tocar mi cosa today, whatever the matter was, and I was loath to contendre her to faire, de peur qu’elle faisait son mari prendre notice thereof.

1667-01-27 19:35   I walked to the Swan in the Palace yard and there with much ado did get a waterman, and so I sent for the Michells, and they come, and their father Howlett and his wife with them, and there we drank, and so into the boat, poor Betty’s head aching.

1667-01-27 17:03   To White Hall, and there I shewed my cozen Roger the Duchesse of York sitting in state, while her mother stands by her; he had a desire, and I shewed him my Lady Castlemayne, whom he approves to be handsome, and wonders that she cannot be as good within as she is fair without.

1667-01-27 15:30   Reading Erasmus “de scribendis epistolis,” a very good book, especially one letter of advice to a courtier most true and good, which made me once resolve to tear out the two leaves that it was writ in, but I forebore it.

1667-01-27 07:35   Up betimes, and leaving my wife to go by coach to hear Mr. Frampton preach, which I had a mighty desire she should, I down to the Old Swan, and there to Michell and staid while he and she dressed themselves, and here had a ‘baiser’ or two of her, whom I love mightily.

1667-01-26 22:20   I to make an end of my letters, and so home to supper and to bed, Balty lodging here with my brother, he being newly returned from mustering in the river.

1667-01-26 12:04   Sat all the morning, where among other things I did the first unkind thing that ever I did design to Sir W. Warren, but I did it now to some purpose, to make him sensible how little any man’s friendship shall avail him if he wants money.

1667-01-25 16:30   I saw the Poll Bill, now printed; wherein I do fear I shall be deeply concerned, being to be taxed for all my offices, and then for my money that I have, and my title, as well as my head. It is a great tax; but I do think it is so perplexed it will hardly ever be collected duly.

1667-01-25 12:03   To the office, where Lord Bruncker and Sir J. Minnes and I did meet, and sat about dividing the Controller’s work according to the late order of Council, between them two and Sir W. Pen, and it troubled me to see the poor honest man, Sir J. Minnes, troubled at it.

1667-01-25 04:50 r And so to bed, my mind satisfied with all this evening’s work, and thinking it to be one of the merriest enjoyment I must look for in the world, and did content myself with the thoughts of it; only the musique did not please me, they not being contented with less than 30s.

1667-01-25 04:28 r The company being all gone to their homes, I up with Mrs. Pierce to Knipp, who was in bed; and we waked her, and there I handled her breasts and did baiser la, and sing a song, lying by her on the bed, and then left my wife to see Mrs. Pierce in bed to her, in our best chamber.

1667-01-25 03:55 r We continued dancing and singing; and, among other things, our Mercer unexpectedly did happen to sing an Italian song I know not, of which they two sung the other two parts to, that did almost ravish me, and made me in love with her more than ever with her singing.

1667-01-25 03:20 r After supper to dancing again and singing, and then, with extraordinary pleasure, broke up only towards morning, Knipp fell a little ill, and so my wife home with her to put her to bed.

1667-01-24 22:48 r Then to supper in the office, a cold, good supper, and wondrous merry. Here was Mrs. Turner also, but the poor woman sad about her lodgings, and Mrs. Markham.

1667-01-24 21:55 r Among other things, Harris sung his Irish song — the strangest in itself, and the prettiest sung by him, that ever I heard.

1667-01-24 21:50 r With all my company down to the office, and there fell to dancing, there coming Mrs. Anne Jones who dances well, and all in mighty good humour, and danced with great pleasure; and then sung and then danced, and then sung many things of three voices.

1667-01-24 20:15 r Harris I first took to my closet; and I find him a very curious and understanding person in all pictures and other things, and a man of fine conversation; and so is Rolt.

1667-01-24 19:32 r Anon comes Mr. Harris, of the Duke’s playhouse, and brings Mrs. Pierce with him, and also one dressed like a country-maid with a straw hat on; which I could not tell who it was, though I expected Knipp: but it was she coming off the stage just as she acted in “The Goblins”.

1667-01-24 19:04 r I home, where most of my company come of this end of the town — Mercer and her sister, Mr. Batelier and Pembleton (my Lady Pen, and Pegg, and Mr. Lowther, but did not stay long), and also Captain Rolt.

1667-01-24 18:30 r I entering my letters and getting the office swept and a good fire made and abundance of candles lighted.

1667-01-24 10:10   While we were sitting at the office, we were frighted with news of fire at Sir W. Batten’s by a chimney taking fire, and it put me into much fear and trouble, but with a great many hands and pains it was soon stopped.

1667-01-23 20:45 r When I come home, hear of no disturbance there of the seamen, but that one of them, being arrested to-day, others do go and rescue him.

1667-01-23 19:03 r We away, Mr. Pierce and I, on foot to his house, the women by coach. In our way we find the Guards of horse in the street, and hear the occasion to be news that the seamen are in a mutiny, which put me into a great fright.

1667-01-23 18:25 r Knipp made us stay in a box and see the dancing preparatory to tomorrow for “The Goblins,” a play of Suckling’s, not acted these twenty-five years; which was pretty.

1667-01-23 17:57 r We spied Mrs. Pierce; and, going out, they called us, and so we staid; and Knipp took us all in and brought to us Nelly; a most pretty woman, who acted the great part of Coelia today very fine, and did it well: I kissed her, and so did my wife; and a mighty pretty soul she is.

1667-01-23 17:49   To the King’s house, and there saw “The Humerous Lieutenant,” a silly play, I think; only the Spirit in it that grows very tall, and then sinks again to nothing, having two heads breeding upon one, and then Knipp’s singing, did please us.

1667-01-23 13:35   I to the Castle Tavern, where was and did come all our company, Sir W. Batten, W. Pen, R. Ford, and our Counsel Sir Ellis Layton, Walt Walker, Dr. Budd, Mr. Holder, and several others, and here we had a bad dinner of our preparing.

1667-01-23 11:25 r A pretty library they have. And I was in the refectoire, where every man his napkin, knife, cup of earth, and basin of the same; and a place for one to sit and read while the rest are at meals.

1667-01-23 11:15 r I saw the dortoire and the cells of the priests, and we went into one; a very pretty little room, very clean, hung with pictures, set with books. The Priest was in his cell, with his hair clothes to his skin, bare-legged with a sandall only on, and his little bed without sheets.

1667-01-23 10:48 r Showing me most excellent pieces in wax-worke: a crucifix given by a Pope to Mary Queen of Scotts, where a piece of the Cross is; two bits set in the manner of a cross in the foot of the crucifix: several fine pictures, but especially very good prints of holy pictures.

1667-01-23 10:36 r My Lord and I walking into the Park, I did observe the new buildings, and my Lord, seeing I had a desire to see them, they being the place for the priests and friers, he took me back to my Lord Almoner; and he took us through the whole house and chapel, and the new monastery.

1667-01-23 10:05 r I do also observe the counterfeit windows there was, in the form of doors with looking-glasses instead of windows, which makes the room seem both bigger and lighter, I think; and I have some thoughts to have the like in one of my rooms.

1667-01-23 10:02 r Here we sat and talked with my Lord Almoner a good while, and he seems a good-natured gentleman: here I observed the deske which he hath to remove, and is fastened to one of the armes of his chayre.

1667-01-23 09:35   To St. James’s, to see the organ Mrs. Turner told me of; I took my Lord Bruncker, he being acquainted with my present Lord Almoner, Mr Howard; he and I did see the organ, but I do not like it, it being but a bauble, with a virginall joining to it, so I shall not meddle with it.

1667-01-22 13:32   There comes a letter from Mrs. Pierce, telling me she will come and dine with us on Thursday next, with some of the players, Knipp, &c, which I was glad of but my wife vexed, which vexed me; but I seemed merry, but know not how to order the matter, whether they shall come or no.

1667-01-22 10:53   To the office, where I read the Council’s order about my Lord Bruncker and Sir W. Pen to be assistants to the Comptroller, which quietly went down with Sir J. Minnes, poor man, seeming a little as if he would be thought to have desired it, but yet apparently to his discontent.

1667-01-22 08:10 r I did give Darnell a crowne for them, and did enquire after the music of the “Siege of Rhodes,” which, he tells me, he can get me, which I am mighty glad of.

1667-01-22 07:55   There come to me Darnell the fiddler, one of the Duke’s house, and brought me a set of lessons, all three parts, I heard them play to the Duke of York after Christmas at his lodgings, and bid him get me them.

1667-01-21 20:50   Home, where W. Hewer’s mother was, and Mrs. Turner, our neighbour, and supped with us. His mother a well-favoured old little woman, and a good woman, I believe.

1667-01-21 16:28   I walked home, and there come into my company three drunken seamen, but one especially, who told me such stories, calling me Captain, as made me mighty merry, and they would leap and skip, and kiss what maids they met all the way.

1667-01-21 11:06   At home find Lovett, to whom I did give my Lady Castlemayne’s head to do. He is talking of going into Spain to get money by his art, but I doubt he will do no good, he being a man of an unsettled head.

1667-01-21 08:15 r We had no satisfaction, nor did give the Swede’s Embassador any, but I find him a cunning fellow. He lives in one of the great houses there, but ill-furnished; and come to us out of bed in his furred mittens and furred cap.

1667-01-21 07:06   With, Sir W. Batten, W. Pen, R. Ford, by coach to the Swede’s Resident’s in the Piatza, to discourse with him about two of our prizes, wherein he puts in his concernment as for his countrymen.

1667-01-20 18:20   I met Mr. Brisband, with whom good discourse, and he did lend me “The Third Advice to a Paynter,” a bitter satyr upon the service of the Duke of Albemarle the last year. I took it home with me, and will copy it, having the former, being also mightily pleased with it.

1667-01-20 10:28 r Mr. Frampton’s text, Ecclesiastes xi, verse 8th — the words, “But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all, yet let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.”

1667-01-20 10:25 r To my great joy I hear Mr. Frampton preach, the best sermon, for goodness and oratory, without affectation or study, that ever I heard in my life. He preaches the most like an apostle that ever I heard man; and it was much the best time that ever I spent in my life at church.

1667-01-20 09:57   To church and there, beyond expectation, find our seat and all the church crammed by twice as many people as used to be, and to my great joy find Mr. Frampton in the pulpit.

1667-01-20 08:48   To Sir W. Coventry. Discourse, especially about the heat the House was in yesterday about the ill management of the Navy, which I was sorry to hear; though I think they were well answered, both by Sir G. Carteret and W. Coventry, as he informs me the substance of their speeches.

1667-01-20 07:27   Up betimes and down to the Old Swan, there called on Michell and his wife, which in her night linen appeared as pretty almost as ever to my thinking I saw woman. They shewed me their house, which, poor people, they have built, and is very pretty.

1667-01-19 12:48   Dined, and Mr. Pierce come to see me, he newly come from keeping his Christmas in the country.

1667-01-18 19:17   All the afternoon in my closet till night, sorting all my papers, which have lain unsorted for all the time we were at Greenwich during the plague, which did please me also, I drawing on to put my office into a good posture, though much is behind.

1667-01-18 11:27   Most of the morning finishing my entry of my journall during the late fire out of loose papers into this book, which did please me mightily when done, I writing till my eyes were almost blind therewith to make an end of it.

1667-01-18 09:40   There come to the office a letter from the Duke of York, commanding our payment of no wages to any of the muster-masters of the fleet the last year, but only two, my brother Balty, and one Ward who, though he had not taken so much as the other, yet had done more than the rest.

1667-01-17 22:15   To the office busy till very late, my heart joyed with the effects of my following my business, by easing my head of cares.

1667-01-16 21:04   This day I observe still, in many places, the smoking remains of the late fire: the ways mighty bad and dirty.

1667-01-16 20:01   My wife told me how she had moved to W. Hewer the business of my sister for a wife to him, which he received with mighty acknowledgements, as she says, above anything; but says he hath no intention to alter his condition: so that I am in some measure sorry she ever moved it.

1667-01-16 16:40   I did hear a piece of a cause, heard before the King, about a ship deserted by her fellows (who were bound mutually to defend each other), in their way to Virginy, and taken by the enemy, but it was but meanly pleaded.

1667-01-16 09:23 r The Duke offered that Balty and one more should have not only their own, but part of the others’ salary, but that I having said he was my brother-in-law, he did stop, but they two are ordered their pay. Some of the rest will lose their pay, and others be laid by the heels.

1667-01-16 09:20   Before the Duke of York, the business of the Muster-Masters was reported, and Balty found the best of the whole number, so as the Duke enquired who he was, and whether he was a stranger by his two names, both strange.

1667-01-15 22:40   Home to supper and to bed with my mind mighty light to see the fruits of my diligence in having my business go off my hand so merrily.

1667-01-15 16:58   We were all mightily troubled how to prevent the sale of a great deal of hemp, and timber-deals, and other good goods tomorrow at the candle by the Prize Office, where it will be sold for little, and we shall be found to want the same goods and buy at extraordinary prices.

1667-01-15 14:30   Dined with my wife and were pleasant, and then to the office, where I got Mrs. Burroughs sola cum ego – and did tocar su mamelles so as to hazer me hazer. She gone, I to my business.

1667-01-15 09:09   My Lord Bruncker would have made me promise to go with him to a play this afternoon, where Knipp acts Mrs Weaver’s great part in “The Indian Emperour” and he says is coming on to be a great actor. But I am so fell to my business that I, though against my inclination, will not go.

1667-01-14 19:48   Busy till night, pleasing myself mightily to see what a deal of business goes off of a man’s hands when he stays by it, and then, at night, before it was late (yet much business done) home to supper.

1667-01-14 16:10   Sir W. Batten tells me the Lords do agree at last with the Commons about the word “Nuisance” in the Irish Bill, and do desire a good correspondence between the two Houses; and that the King do intend to prorogue them the last of this month.

1667-01-14 14:27   I understand my father is pretty well again, blessed be God! and would have my Brother John come down to him for a little while.

1667-01-13 14:55   To the Old Swan, thinking to have got a boat to White Hall, but could not, nor was there anybody at home at Michell’s, where I thought to have sat with her – et peut ëtre obtain algo de her – which I did intend para essayer.

1667-01-13 09:20   To church, where young Lowther come to church with Sir W. Pen and his Lady and daughter, and my wife tells me that either they are married or the match is quite perfected, which I am apt to believe, because all the peoples eyes in the church were much fixed upon them.

1667-01-12 22:30   So home to supper, and then to read a little in Moore’s “Antidote against Atheisme,” a pretty book, and so to bed.

1667-01-12 18:05   To the office again, mighty busy, and did to the joy of my soul dispatch much business, which do make my heart light, and will enable me to recover all the ground I have lost (if I have by my late minding my pleasures lost any) and assert myself.

1667-01-11 21:10   This day ill news of my father’s being very ill of his old grief the rupture, which troubles me.

1667-01-11 17:20   To the office with my people and very busy, and did dispatch to my great satisfaction abundance of business, and do resolve, by the grace of God, to stick to it till I have cleared my heart of most things wherein I am in arrear in public and private matters.

1667-01-11 11:27 r Sir W. Warren tells me how my Lord Bruncker should take notice of the two flagons he saw at my house at dinner, at my late feast, and merrily, yet I know enviously, said, I could not come honestly by them. This I am glad to hear, though vexed to see his ignoble soul.

1667-01-11 11:03   Comes Sir W. Warren and walked with me awhile, whose discourse I love, he being a very wise man and full of good counsel, and his own practices for wisdom much to be observed.

1667-01-11 06:10   Up, being troubled at my being found abed a-days by all sorts of people, I having got a trick of sitting up later than I need, never supping, or very seldom, before 12 at night.

1667-01-10 15:15   To the office, where we and some of the chief of the Trinity House met to examine the occasion of the loss of The Prince Royall, the master and mates being examined, which I took and keep.

1667-01-09 17:27 r My Lord Bruncker, who pretended to make a congratulatory speech upon their coming hither, and in thanks to Mr. Howard, do it in the worst manner in the world, being the worst speaker, so as I do wonder at his parts and the unhappiness of his speaking.

1667-01-09 16:45 r Here was an experiment shown about improving the use of powder for creating of force in winding up of springs and other uses of great worth.

1667-01-09 15:37   To Arundell House, where first the Royall Society meet, by the favour of Mr. Harry Howard, who was there, and has given us his grandfather’s library, a noble gift, and a noble favour and undertaking it is for him to make his house the seat for this college.

1667-01-09 13:45   I by coach to the ordinary by the Temple, and there dined alone on a rabbit, and read a book I brought home from Mrs. Michell’s, of the proceedings of the Parliament in the 3rd and 4th year of the late King, a very good book for speeches and for arguments of law.

1667-01-09 10:32   To Westminster Hall, and there to the conference of the Houses about the word “Nuisance,” which the Commons would have, and the Lords will not, in the Irish Bill. The Commons do it to prevent the King’s dispensing with it.

1667-01-09 08:15   Up, and with Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen in a hackney-coach to White Hall, the way being most horribly bad upon the breaking up of the frost, so as not to be passed almost.

1667-01-08 22:13   To supper, and then saw the catalogue of my books, which my brother had wrote out, now perfectly alphabeticall, and so to bed.

1667-01-08 21:47   Sir W. Coventry hath resigned his place of Commissioner of the Navy, the thing he hath often told me that he had a mind to do, but I am surprised to think that he hath done it, and am full of thoughts all this evening after I heard it what may be the consequences of it to me.

1667-01-08 19:32 r Which if true is excellent invention to clear both the Duchesse from poison or the Duke from lying with her.

1667-01-08 19:30   Sir Richard Ford tells us that upon opening the body of my Lady Denham it is said that they found a vessel about her matrix which had never been broke by her husband, that caused all pains in her body.

1667-01-08 12:32   Home to dinner, where my uncle Thomas with me to receive his quarterage. He tells me his son Thomas is set up in Smithfield, where he hath a shop.

1667-01-07 21:45   To write over fair my vows for this year, and then to supper, and to bed. In great peace of mind having now done it, and brought myself into order again and a resolution of keeping it, and having entered my journall to this night, so to bed, my eyes failing me with writing.

1667-01-07 19:15 r So home, it being the last play now I am to see till a fortnight hence, I being from the last night entered into my vows for the year coming on.

1667-01-07 18:02   To the Duke’s house, and saw “Macbeth,” which, though I saw it lately, yet appears a most excellent play in all respects, but especially in divertisement, though it be a deep tragedy; which is a strange perfection in a tragedy, it being most proper here, and suitable.

1667-01-07 12:26   My Lord Bruncker tells me how Mr. Henry Howard, of Norfolke, hath given our Royal Society all his grandfather’s library: which noble gift they value at 1000l; and gives them accommodation to meet in at his house, Arundell House, they being now disturbed at Gresham College.

1667-01-07 12:03 r The Duke of York is troubled for her; but hath declared he will never have another public mistress again; which I shall be glad of, and would the King would do the like.

1667-01-07 12:01   My Lord Bruncker tells me that my Lady Denham is at last dead. Some suspect her poisoned, but it will be best known when her body is opened, which will be to-day, she dying yesterday morning.

1667-01-06 18:15 r Thence all along Thames Street, and so up by London Wall, by Blackfriars, to Ludgate; and thence to Bridewell, which I find to have been heretofore an extraordinary good house; and so to look about St. Bride’s church and my father’s house, and so walked home.

1667-01-06 16:10   Young Michell and I, it being an excellent frosty day to walk, did walk out, he showing me the baker’s house in Pudding Lane, where the late great fire begun.

1667-01-06 14:33 r Here come also Mr. Howe to dine with me, and we had a good dinner and good merry discourse with much pleasure, I enjoying myself mightily to have friends at my table.

1667-01-06 12:53   Betty Michell and her husband come by invitation to dine with us, and, she I find the same as ever (which I was afraid of the contrary) notwithstanding what yo haze ella hazer cum ego gthe last Sunday but one, when we were abroad together.

1667-01-06 06:20   I lay with much pain in my head most of the night, and very unquiet, partly by my drinking before I went out too great a draught of sack, and partly my eyes being still very sore.

1667-01-05 17:52   With my wife to the Duke’s house, and there saw “Mustapha,” a most excellent play for words and design as ever I did see. I had seen it before but forgot it, so it was wholly new to me, which is the pleasure of my not committing these things to my memory.

1667-01-05 12:10   Thinking to have been taken home, and my wife (according to appointment yesterday), by my Lord Bruncker, to dinner, but he had forgot it, at which I was glad, being glad of avoiding the occasion of inviting him again, and being forced to invite his doxy, Mrs. Williams.

1667-01-04 22:47 r I do observe Mr. Lowther to be a pretty gentleman, and too good for Peg; and, by the way, Peg Pen seems mightily to be kind to me; but I believe not a little troubled to see my plenty, and was much troubled to hear the song I sung, “The New Droll” — it touching him home.

1667-01-04 22:44 r To cards, and then to sing and talk, and at night to sup; and, last of all, to have a flaggon of ale and apples, drunk out of a wood cupp, as a Christmas draught, made all merry; and they full of admiration at my plate, particularly my flaggons (which, indeed, are noble).

1667-01-04 14:50 r I did make them all gaze to see themselves served so nobly in plate, and a neat dinner, indeed, though but of seven dishes. Mighty merry I was and made them all, and they mightily pleased.

1667-01-04 13:07   Anon comes our company; my Lord Bruncker, Sir W. Pen, his lady, and Pegg, and her servant, Mr. Lowther, my Lady Batten (Sir W. Batten being forced to dine at Sir R. Ford’s), Mr. Turner and his wife. Here I had good room for ten, and no more would my table have held well.

1667-01-03 21:10   This day hath been a conference between the two Houses about the Bill for examining Accounts, wherein the House of Lords their proceedings in petitioning the King for doing it by Commission is, in great heat, voted by the Commons, after the conference, unparliamentary.

1667-01-03 14:08   By invitation to dinner to Sir W. Pen’s, where my Lord Bruncker, Sir W. Batten, and his lady, myself, and wife, Sir J. Minnes, and Mr. Turner and his wife. Indifferent merry, to which I contributed the most, but a mean dinner, and in a mean manner.

1667-01-02 22:03   Home and to my chamber to set down my journal, and then to thinking upon establishing my vows against the next year, and so to supper and to bed.

1667-01-02 18:49   By link, walked home, it being mighty cold but dry, yet bad walking because very slippery with the frost and treading.

1667-01-02 17:45   To the King’s House, and there saw “The Custome of the Country,” wherein Knipp does the Widow well; but, of all the plays that ever I did see, the worst, having neither plot, language, nor anything in the earth that is acceptable; only Knipp sings a little song admirably.

1667-01-02 13:37   To the Rose Tavern, while Doll Lane come to me, and we did biber a good deal de vino, et jo did give ella 12 solidos para comprar ella some gans for a new ano’s gift. I did tocar et no mas su cosa, but in fit time and place jo creo que je pouvais faire whatever I would con ella.

1667-01-02 11:50   Up to the Painted Chamber, and there heard a conference between the House of Lords and Commons about the Wine Patent; which I was exceeding glad to be at, because of my hearing exceeding good discourses, but especially from the Commons.

1667-01-02 10:40   I find the Court full of great apprehensions of the French, who have certainly shipped landsmen, great numbers, at Brest; and most of our people here guess his design for Ireland. We have orders to send all the ships we can possible to the Downes.

1667-01-02 09:10   Up, I, and walked to White Hall to attend the Duke of York, as usual. My wife up, and with Mrs. Pen to walk in the fields to frost-bite themselves.

1667-01-01 14:24   Home to dinner, where the best powdered goose that ever I eat.

1667-01-01 12:55   To the ’Change a little, where Mr. James Houblon and I walked a good while speaking of our ill condition in not being able to set out a fleet (we doubt) this year, and the certain ill effect that must bring, which is lamentable.

1667-01-01 08:24   Lay long, being a bitter, cold, frosty day, the frost being now grown old, and the Thames covered with ice.
