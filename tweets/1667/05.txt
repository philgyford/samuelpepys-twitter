1667-05-31 22:15 r Late to supper, and with great quiet to bed; finding by the balance of my account that I am creditor 6900l, for which the Lord of Heaven be praised!

1667-05-31 20:20   Home, and there, to my unexpected satisfaction, did get my intricate accounts of interest, which have been of late much perplexed by mixing of some moneys of Sir G. Carteret’s with mine, evened and set right.

1667-05-31 14:07   To the office, where the weather so hot now-a-days that I cannot but sleep before I do any business.

1667-05-31 10:32 r Secretary Morris believes we are, and shall be, only fooled by the French; and that the Dutch are very high and insolent, and do look upon us as come over only to beg a peace; which troubles me very much, and I do fear it is true.

1667-05-31 09:57   By water to White Hall to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, the first time I ever was there and I think the second that they have met at the Treasury chamber there.

1667-05-31 08:20   I took Mrs. Daniel into the office to discourse with her about getting some employment for her husband. And there I did put my hand to her belly, so as to make myself do, but she is so lean that I had no great pleasure with her.

1667-05-30 17:35 r Several fine experiments were shown the Duchesse of colours, loadstones, microscopes, and of liquors among others, of one that did, while she was there, turn a piece of roasted mutton into pure blood, which was very rare.

1667-05-30 16:22 r The Duchesse hath been a good, comely woman; but her dress so antick, and her deportment so ordinary, that I do not like her at all, nor did I hear her say any thing that was worth hearing, but that she was full of admiration, all admiration.

1667-05-30 15:55 r Anon comes the Duchesse with her women attending her; among others, the Ferabosco, of whom so much talk is that her lady would bid her show her face and kill the gallants. She hath good black little eyes, but otherwise but an ordinary woman I do think, but they say sings well.

1667-05-30 15:40   To Arundell House where I find very much company, in expectation of the Duchesse of Newcastle, who had desired to be invited to the Society; and was, after much debate, pro and con, it seems many being against it; and we do believe the town will be full of ballads of it.

1667-05-30 12:58   Dined at home, being without any words friends with my wife, though last night I was very angry, and do think I did give her as much cause to be angry with me.

1667-05-29 20:04 r To my chamber, vexed, and to my accounts, which I ended to my great content, and did make amends for the loss of our mirth this night, by getting this done.

1667-05-29 15:26 r I went out of doors to the office and there staid, and would not go to our intended meeting, which vexed me to the blood, and my wife sent twice or thrice to me, to direct her any way to dress her.

1667-05-29 14:55 r Anon comes down my wife, dressed in her second mourning, with her black moyre waistcoat, and short petticoat, laced with silver lace so basely that I could not endure to see her, and with laced lining, which is too soon, so that I was horrid angry.

1667-05-29 14:02   My wife comes home from Woolwich, but did not dine with me, going to dress herself against night, to go to Mrs. Pierce’s to be merry, where we are to have Knepp and Harris and other good people.

1667-05-29 09:30   Into the Duke’s closett, where little to do, but complaint for want of money and a motion of Sir W. Coventry’s that we should all now bethink ourselves of lessening charge to the King, which he said was the only way he saw likely to put the King out of debt.

1667-05-28 22:22   I to Sir W. Pen, where he and his Lady and Pegg and pretty Mrs. Lowther her sister-in-law at supper, where I sat and talked, and Sir W. Pen, half drunk, did talk like a fool and vex his wife, that I was half pleased and half vexed to see so much folly and rudeness from him.

1667-05-28 21:16 r Sometimes the ladies put themselves along with other company, then the other drew back; the last did get out of the house and took boat and away. I was troubled to see them abused; and could have found in my heart, as little desire of fighting as I have, to have protected them.

1667-05-28 21:12 r There were two pretty women alone, that walked a great while, which being discovered by some idle gentlemen, they would needs take them up; but to see the poor ladies how they were put to it to run from them, and they after them.

1667-05-28 20:34 r But to hear the nightingale and other birds, and here fiddles, and there a harp, and here a Jew’s trump, and here laughing, and there fine people walking, is mighty divertising.

1667-05-28 20:15   Creed and I by water to Fox-hall, and there walked in Spring Garden. A great deal of company, and the weather and garden pleasant: that it is very pleasant and cheap going thither, for a man may go to spend what he will, or nothing, all is one.

1667-05-28 13:40   My wife away down with Jane and W. Hewer to Woolwich, in order to a little ayre and to lie there tonight, and so to gather May-dew tomorrow morning, which Mrs. Turner hath taught her as the only thing in the world to wash her face with.

1667-05-28 09:10   Sir W. Coventry tells me his brother Commissioners have chosen Sir G. Downing their Secretary, who will be as fit a man as any in the world. My heart is glad to see so great hopes of good to the nation as will be by these men.

1667-05-27 16:35 r It was pleasant to see, but that I stood in the pit, and feared that in the tumult I might get some hurt. At last the rabble broke up, and so I away to White Hall.

1667-05-27 16:26 r But, Lord! to see how in a minute the whole stage was full of watermen to revenge the foul play, and the butchers to defend their fellow, though most blamed him; and there they all fell to it to knocking down and cutting many on each side.

1667-05-27 16:22 r The former had the better all along, till by and by the latter dropped his sword out of his hand, and the butcher, whether not seeing his sword dropped I know not, but did give him a cut over the wrist, so as he was disabled to fight any longer.

1667-05-27 16:10   Abroad, and stopped at the Bear-garden-stairs, to see a prize fought. But the house so full there was no getting in, so forced to go through into the pit where the bears are baited; and upon a stool did see them fight, which they did very furiously, a butcher and a waterman.

1667-05-27 13:20   Comes Carcasse to speak with me but I would not give him way to enlarge on anything, but he would have begun to have made a noise how I have undone him and used all the wit I could in the drawing up of his report, wherein he told me I had taken a great deal of pains to undo him.

1667-05-27 11:10   I met Mr. Pierce, who tells me that he lately met Mr. Carcasse, who do mightily inveigh against me, for that all that has been done against him he lays on me, and I think he is in the right and I do own it.

1667-05-27 08:03   There come Richardson, the bookbinder, with one of Ogilby’s Bibles in quires for me to see and buy, it being Mr. Cade’s, my stationer’s; but it is like to be so big that I shall not use it, it being too great to stir up and down without much trouble.

1667-05-26 22:02 r W. Hewer being here did do the business in getting my father’s bowel, that was fallen down, into his body again, and that which made me more sensible of it was that he this morning did show me the place where his bowel did use to fall down and swell, which did trouble me to see.

1667-05-26 21:48 r Home, where I find my poor father newly come out of an unexpected fit of his pain, that they feared he would have died. They had sent for me to White Hall and all up and down, and for Mr. Holliard also, who did come.

1667-05-26 20:10 r I walked the length of the Elmes, and with great pleasure saw some gallant ladies and people come with their bottles, and basket, and chairs, and form, to sup under the trees, by the waterside, which was mighty pleasant.

1667-05-26 18:30   To my boat, and up with it as far as Barne Elmes, reading of Mr. Evelyn’s late new book against Solitude, in which I do not find much excess of good matter, though it be pretty for a bye discourse.

1667-05-26 17:12 r Then to Mrs. Martin, and there staid with her an hour or two, and there did what I would with her.

1667-05-26 15:38 r But I did entertain myself with my perspective glass up and down the church, by which I had the great pleasure of seeing and gazing at a great many very fine women; and what with that, and sleeping, I passed away the time till sermon was done.

1667-05-26 15:33   To Westminster, towards the parish church. I met with Mr. Howlett, who, offering me a pew in the gallery, I had no excuse but up with him I must go, and then much against my will staid out the whole church in pain while Mrs. Martin expected me at home.

1667-05-26 06:04   Up sooner than usual, and to walk, it being exceeding hot all night (so as this night I begun to leave off my waistcoat this year) and this morning.

1667-05-25 16:10   Comes Mrs. Pierce to see my wife, and I into them, and there find Pierce very fine, and in her own hair, which do become her, and so says my wife, ten times better than lighter hair, her complexion being mighty good.

1667-05-25 13:14   Dined at home, and there come Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, and dined with me, telling me that the Duke of Cambridge continues very ill, so as they do despair of his living.

1667-05-24 17:30   To the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Mayden Queene,” which, though I have often seen, yet pleases me infinitely, it being impossible, I think, ever to have the Queen’s part and Florimel’s part ever done better than they two are by young Marshall and Nelly.

1667-05-24 14:29 r After dinner was all our sport, when there come in a juggler, who did show us so good tricks as I have never seen in my life, I think, of legerdemaine, and such as my wife hath since seriously said that she would not believe but that he did them by the help of the devil.

1667-05-24 13:46   To Islington to the old house, where Sir W. Penn’s lady and Madam Lowther and her mother-in-law, did meet us, and two of Mr. Lowther’s brothers, and here dined upon nothing but pigeon-pyes, which was such a thing for him to invite all the company to, that I was ashamed of it.

1667-05-23 20:22   I hear that last night the Duke of Kendall, second son of the Duke of York, did die; and that the other, Duke of Cambridge, continues very ill still.

1667-05-23 16:57   I had the opportunity para jouer with Mrs. Pen, tocando her mamelles and besando ella – being sola in the casa of her pater – and she fort willing.

1667-05-23 15:12 r Back home again, and there was asked by my wife, I know not whether simply or with design, how I come to look as I did, car yo was in much calor et de body and of animi, which I put off with the heat of the season.

1667-05-23 14:52 r I do promise, and mean to do what kindness I can to Mrs. Daniel’s husband; and after having been there hasta yo was ashamed, de peur that my people pensaient to pragma de it, or les they might espy nous through some trees, we parted.

1667-05-23 14:40   They tell Mrs. Daniel would speak with me, so I down to the parlour to her; and here I did adventure etsi the porta etait operta para put my mano abajo su jupes two or three temps et touch her cosa con great pleasure, ella resisting pretty much, sed never the minus submitted.

1667-05-23 13:11   Home, and with my father dined, and, poor man! he hath put off his travelling-clothes today, and is mighty spruce, and I love to see him cheerful.

1667-05-22 22:04   To supper, and my wife to her flageolet, wherein she did make out a tune so prettily of herself, that I was infinitely pleased beyond whatever I expected from her, and so to bed.

1667-05-22 16:33 r But here Knipp spied me out of the tiring-room, and come to the pit door, and I out to her, and kissed her, she only coming to see me, being in a country-dress, she, and others having, it seemed, had a country-dance in the play.

1667-05-22 16:24   To the King’s house, where I did give 18d, and saw the two last acts of “The Goblins,” a play I could not make any thing of by these two acts.

1667-05-22 12:15   So home, and by and by comes my poor father, much better than I expected, being at ease by fits, according as his truss sits, and at another time in as much pain. I am mighty glad to see him come well to town.

1667-05-22 11:47 r Here I met my uncle Wight, the second day he hath been abroad, having been sick these two months even to death, but having never sent to me even in the greatest of his danger.

1667-05-22 11:35   To the ’Change, and there staid a little, where most of the news is that the Swedes are likely to fall out with the Dutch, which we wish, but how true I know not.

1667-05-22 11:10   To the Red Lyon, thinking to meet my father, but I come too soon, but my wife is gone out of town to meet him. I am in great pain, poor man, for him, lest he should come up in pain to town.

1667-05-21 23:55 r Then we fell to talk of Sir W. Pen, and his family and rise. Mrs. Turner says that he was a pityfull fellow when she first knew them; that his lady was one of the sourest, dirty women, that ever she saw.

1667-05-21 23:42 r Mrs. Griffin do say that Lord Bruncker do not keep Mrs. Williams now for love, but need, he having another whore that he keeps in Covent Garden; that they do owe money everywhere almost for every thing, even Mrs. Shipman for her butter and cheese about 3l.

1667-05-21 23:20 r Mr. Harper at Deptford did himself tell Mrs. Turner that my Lord Bruncker hath had of Foly, the ironmonger, 50l. worth in locks and keys for his house, and that it is from the fineness of them, having some of 4l. and 5l. a lock, such as is in the Duke’s closet.

1667-05-21 22:58   Mrs. Turner come to see my wife and me, and sit and talk with us, and so, my wife not being well and going to bed, Mrs. Turner and I sat up talking alone.

1667-05-21 15:15 r Lord! how it went against my heart to go away from the very door of the Duke’s play-house, and my Lady Castlemayne’s coach, and many great coaches there, to see “The Siege of Rhodes.” I was very near making a forfeit, but I did command myself, and so home to my office.

1667-05-21 14:48   I with Mr. Commander and Mr. Hide’s brother to Lincolne’s Inne Fields, and there viewed several coach-houses, and satisfied ourselves now fully in it, and then there parted, leaving the rest to future discourse between us.

1667-05-21 12:32   Dined at home with my wife and find a new girle, a good big girle come to us, got by Payne to be our girle; and his daughter Nell we make our cook. This wench’s name is Mary, and seems a good likely maid.

1667-05-20 20:58   I find it everywhere now to be a thing doubted whether we shall have peace or no, and the captain of one of our ships that went with the Embassadors do say, that the seamen of Holland to his hearing did defy us, and called us English dogs.

1667-05-20 17:11 r So away to Mrs. Martin’s lodging, who was gone before expecting me, and there yo haze what yo vellem cum her, and drank.

1667-05-20 16:04 r Thence down to the Old Swan, and there saw Betty Michell, whom I have not seen since her christening. But, Lord! how pretty she is, and looks as well as ever I saw her, and her child (which I am fain to seem very fond of) is pretty also, I think, and will be.

1667-05-20 15:20   I did walk abroad, first through the Minorys, the first time I have been over the Hill to the postern-gate, and seen the place, since the houses were pulled down about that side of the Tower, since the fire.

1667-05-20 11:48 r Mr. Commander and I to Mr. Hide’s to look upon the ground again behind our house, and concluded upon his going along with us tomorrow to see some stables, he thinking that we demand more than is necessary.

1667-05-20 11:10   Mr. Commander and I into Lincoln’s Inne Fields, there to look upon the coach-houses to see what ground is necessary for coach-house and horses, because of that that I am going about to do.

1667-05-20 06:22   Up betimes, and comes my flagelette master to set me a new tune, which I played presently, and shall in a month do as much as I desire at it.

1667-05-19 20:55   W. Howe told us how the Barristers and Students of Gray’s Inne rose in rebellion against the Benchers the other day, who outlawed them, and a great deal of do; but now they are at peace again.

1667-05-19 18:18   Home, and there to read the life of Mr. Hooker, which pleases me as much as any thing I have read a great while.

1667-05-19 13:40 r Here was great talk of the good end that my Lord Treasurer made; closing his owne eyes and setting his mouth, and bidding adieu with the greatest content and freedom in the world; and is said to die with the cleanest hands that ever any Lord Treasurer did.

1667-05-19 12:33   To White Hall, and there find Sir G. Carteret just set down to dinner, and I dined with them, as I intended, and good company, the best people and family in the world I think.

1667-05-19 11:04   To church, where my old acquaintance, that dull fellow, Meriton, made a good sermon, and hath a strange knack of a grave, serious delivery, which is very agreeable.

1667-05-18 18:45 r The truth is, though she be the dirtiest, homeliest servant that ever I kept, yet I was sorry to have her go, partly through my love to my servants, and partly because she was a very drudging, working wench, only she would be drunk.

1667-05-18 18:40   By and by home and there find our Luce drunk, and when her mistress told her of it would be gone, and so put up some of her things and did go away of her accord, nobody pressing her to it.

1667-05-18 18:04   To walk an hour in the garden talking with my wife, whose growth in musique do begin to please me mightily.

1667-05-17 21:01   To my house, and with my wife to practice on the flageolet a little, and with great pleasure I see she can readily hit her notes, but only want of practice makes her she cannot go through a whole tune readily.

1667-05-17 16:12   There come the flageolet master, who having had a bad bargain of teaching my wife by the year, she not practising so much as she should do, I did think that the man did deserve more consideration, and so will give him an opportunity of 20s. a month more, and he shall teach me.

1667-05-17 14:37   Mr. Sheply tells me that Jasper Trice and Lewes Phillips and Mr. Ashfield are gone from Brampton, and he thinks chiefly from the height of Sir J. Bernard’s carriage, who carries all things before him there, which they cannot bear with, and so leave the town.

1667-05-17 13:20   To the Three Tuns to dinner with Lord Bruncker, Sir J. Minnes, W. Batten, W. Pen, and T. Harvy, where very merry, and my Lord Bruncker in appearance as good friends as ever, though I know he has a hatred to me in heart.

1667-05-16 22:01   This day Mr. Sheply is come to town and to see me, and he tells me my father is very well only for his pain, so that he is not able to stir; but is in great pain. It troubles me to have him live in that condition of misery if I can help it.

1667-05-16 19:45 r There is a good man gone, and I pray God that the Treasury may not be worse managed by the hands it shall now be put into; though, for certain, the slowness of this man, and remissness, have gone as far to undo the nation, as anything else that hath happened.

1667-05-16 19:33   I and my wife and Sir W. Pen in his coach to Unthanke’s, my wife’s tailor, for her to speak one word, and then we to my Lord Treasurer’s, where I find the porter crying, and suspected it was that my Lord is dead; and, poor Lord! we did find that he was dead just now.

1667-05-16 12:55 r Sir John Fredericke and Sir R. Ford did talk of Paul’s School which must be taken away; and I fear it will be long before another place is found; but they do say that the honour of their company is concerned in the doing of it, and that it is a thing that they are obliged to do.

1667-05-16 12:25 r That that did vex me was that there should come in Mr. Carcasse to be a guest for his money (5s. a piece) as well as any of us. This did vex me, and I would have gone, and did go to my house, thinking to dine at home, but I was called away, and so we sat down, and to dinner.

1667-05-16 12:22 r We were informed that the report of our Embassadors being ill received in their way to Bredah is not true, but that they are received with very great civility, which I am glad to hear.

1667-05-16 12:10   This being Ascension Day, when the boys go on procession round the parish, we were to go to the Three Tuns’ Tavern, to dine with the rest of the parish; where all the parish almost was, Sir Andrew Rickard and others; and Mr. Mills did sit uppermost at the table.

1667-05-15 21:21   News still that my Lord Treasurer is so ill as not to be any man of this world; and it is said that the Treasury shall be managed by Commission.

1667-05-15 15:08   To Sir W. Batten’s, where I hear the news how our Embassadors were but ill received at Flushing, nor at Bredah itself, there being only a house and no furniture provided for them, though it be said that they have as much as the French.

1667-05-15 11:50   My wife had some things brought home by a new woman of the New Exchange, one Mrs. Smith, which she would have me see for her fine hand, and indeed it is a fine hand, and the woman I have observed is a mighty pretty looked woman.

1667-05-15 09:45 r So the Duke of York did like our report, and ordered Carcasse being secured till he did give his security, which did fully content me, and will I hope vindicate the office.

1667-05-15 09:20 r To see how silly Lord Bruncker would have stood to have justified this rogue, which I shall never forget to have been a most malicious or a most silly act, and I do think it is as much the latter as the other, for none but a fool could have done as this silly Lord hath done.

1667-05-15 09:03   Up to the Duke of York’s chamber, to our usual business, and being very glad, we all that signed it presented our report about Carcasse, and did afterwards read it with that success that the Duke of York was for punishing him, not only with turning him out of the office.

1667-05-15 07:35 r Sir W. Pen’s Lady hath been forced to sell some coals only to enable her to pay money that she hath borrowed of Griffin to defray her family expense, which is a strange story for a rogue that spends so much money on clothes and other occasions himself as he do.

1667-05-15 07:32   Sir W. Batten did tell me strange stories of Sir W. Pen, how he is already ashamed of the fine coach which his son-in-law and daughter have made, and indeed it is one of the most ridiculous things for people of their low, mean fashion to make such a coach that ever I saw.

1667-05-15 07:04   Up, and with Sir W. Batten and J. Minnes to St. James’s, and stopt at Temple Bar for Sir J. Minnes to go into the Devil’s Taverne to shit, he having drunk whey, and his belly wrought.

1667-05-14 20:32   Home, and with Fist presently to the finishing the writing fair of our report. And by and by to Sir W. Batten’s, and there he and I and J. Minnes and W. Pen did read and sign it with great good liking, and so away to the office again to look over and correct it.

1667-05-14 17:38   I understand how the two Dukes, the only sons of the Duke of York, are sick even to danger, and that they were both so ill as that the poor Duchess was in doubt which would die first: the Duke of Cambridge of some general disease; the other little Duke of the convulsion fits.

1667-05-14 12:58   Home to dinner, where Mr. Holliard come and eat with us, who among other things do give me good hopes that we shall give my father some ease as to his rupture when he comes to town, which I expect tomorrow.

1667-05-14 05:45   Up by 5 o’clock, and when ready down to my chamber, and there with Mr. Fist, Sir W. Batten’s clerk, who writes mighty well, writing over our report in Mr. Carcasses business.

1667-05-13 20:43   I to finish my report of Carcasse, and then did get Sir W. Batten, Sir J. Minnes, and W. Pen together, and read it over, which they do wonder at, and the trouble I have taken about it, and like the report, so as that they do unanimously resolve to sign it, and stand by it.

1667-05-13 15:40   I to the New Exchange, and there staid a little, and then to a looking-glass shop to consult about covering the wall in my closet over my chimney, which is darkish, with looking-glasses.

1667-05-13 07:32 r But I am the more willing to do it to be rid of one that made work and trouble in the house, and had not qualities of any honour or pleasure to me or my family.

1667-05-13 07:30   My wife rising to send away Barker, according to our resolution last night, and she did do it with more clothes than have cost us 10l, and 20s. in her purse, which I did for the respect I bear Mr. Falconbridge, otherwise she had not deserved half of it.

1667-05-12 18:22   At home my wife finds Barker to have been abroad, and telling her so many lies about it, that she struck her, and the wench said she would not stay with her: so I examined the wench, and found her in so many lies myself, that I was glad to be rid of her.

1667-05-12 16:50   My wife and I to Islington where we ’light, and walked over the fields to Kingsland; a walk I have not taken these twenty years; but puts me in mind of my boy’s time, when I boarded at Kingsland and used to shoot with my bow and arrows in these fields. A very pretty place it is.

1667-05-12 13:47 r At least it would have been anywhere else but in this bad street, and in a perriwigg-maker’s house; but to see the pleasant and ready attendance that we had, and all things so desirous to please, and ingenious in the people, did take me mightily.

1667-05-12 13:45 r In a moment almost had the table covered, and clean glasses, and all in the French manner, and a mess of potage first, and then a couple of pigeons a la esterve, and then a piece of boeuf-a-la-mode, all exceeding well seasoned, and to our great liking.

1667-05-12 12:32   My wife and I to go to a French house to dinner, and so enquired out Monsieur Robins, my perriwigg-maker, who keeps an ordinary, and in an ugly street in Covent Garden, did find him at the door, and so we in.

1667-05-12 07:20 r This vexed me, but I restrained myself from saying anything, but do think never to see this woman — at least, to have her here more, but by and by I did give her money to buy lace, and she promised to wear no more white locks while I lived, and so all very good friends as ever.

1667-05-12 07:14 r In her heat told me of keeping company with Mrs. Knipp, saying, that if I would promise never to see her more — of whom she hath more reason to suspect than I had heretofore of Pembleton — she would never wear white locks more.

1667-05-12 07:10   Comes my wife to me, and we begun calmly, that upon having money to lace her gown for second mourning, she would promise to wear white locks no more in my sight, which I, like a severe fool, begun to except against, and made her fly out to very high terms and cry.

1667-05-11 17:32   In my way home discovered my trouble to my wife for her white locks, swearing by God, several times, which I pray God forgive me for, and bending my fist, that I would not endure it. She, poor wretch, was surprized with it, and made me no answer all the way home.

1667-05-11 16:42   To the Committee of Tangier, where they were discoursing about laws for the civil government of the place, but so dull and so little to the purpose that I fell to slumber, when the fear of being seen by Sir W. Coventry did trouble me much afterwards, but I hope he did not.

1667-05-11 08:24   Home, and there found my door open, which makes me very angry with Nell, and do think to put her away for it, though it do so go against me to part with a servant that it troubles me more than anything in the world.

1667-05-11 07:50   Mr. Commander and I out to the ground behind Sir W. Pen’s, where I am resolved to take a lease of some of it for a stable and coach, unless some change come before I can do it, for I do see it is a greater charge to me now in hackneys, and I am dishonoured by going in them.

1667-05-10 17:15   Drove hard towards Clerkenwell, thinking to have overtaken my Lady Newcastle, whom I saw before us in her coach, with 100 boys and girls running looking upon her but I could not: and so she got home before I could come up to her. But I will get a time to see her.

1667-05-10 14:54 r His brother intending to kill the coachman, who did not please him, this fellow stepped in, and took away his sword; who thereupon took out his knife, which was of the fashion, with a falchion blade, and a little cross at the hilt like a dagger; and with that stabbed him.

1667-05-10 14:50 r After dinner went into the church, and there saw his corpse with the wound in his left breast; a sad spectacle, and a broad wound, which makes my hand now shake to write of it.

1667-05-10 13:15 r There the constable of the parish did show us the picklocks and dice that were found in the dead man’s pocket, and but 18d. in money; and a table-book, wherein were entered the names of several places where he was to go.

1667-05-10 13:12   To the office, where a meeting about the Victuallers’ accounts all the morning, and at noon all of us to Kent’s, at the Three Tuns’ Tavern, and there dined well at Mr. Gawden’s charge.

1667-05-09 18:23 r And who should they be but the two Fieldings; one whereof, Bazill, was page to my Lady Sandwich; and he hath killed the other, himself being very drunk, and so is sent to Newgate.

1667-05-09 18:20   I took up my wife at Unthanke’s, and so home, and in our street, at the Three Tuns’ Tavern door, I find a great hubbub; and what was it but two brothers have fallen out, and one killed the other.

1667-05-09 15:04 r He told me how his clerk Floyd he hath put away for his idlenesse and ill company, and that yesterday he was found not able to come and attend him, by being run into the arme in a squabble, though he pretends it was done in the streets by strangers, by the Maypole in the Strand.

1667-05-09 14:50 r Sir W. Coventry tells me he hears stories of Commissioner Pett, of selling timber to the Navy under other names, which I told him I believe is true, and did give him an instance.

1667-05-09 14:32   I to St. James’s, and there found Sir W. Coventry alone in his chamber, and sat and talked with him more than I have done a great while of several things of the Navy, how our debts and wants do unfit us for doing any thing.

1667-05-08 13:32 r Lovett dined with me but by his discourse I see that he is a man of wit but strange experience, and acquaintance with all manner of subtleties and tricks, that I do think him not fit for me to keep any acquaintance with him, lest he some time or other show me a slippery trick.

1667-05-08 12:20   Comes Lovett with my little print of my dear Lady Castlemayne varnished, and the frame prettily done like gold, which pleases me well.

1667-05-08 12:03   I home to dinner, where I find my wife’s flageolette master, and I am so pleased with her proceeding, though she hath lost time by not practising, that I am resolved for the encouragement of the man to learn myself a little for a month or so.

1667-05-08 11:38   Going home did meet Mr. Andrews our neighbour, and did speak with him to enquire about the ground behind our house, of which I have a mind to buy enough to make a stable and coach-house; for I do see that my condition do require it.

1667-05-08 10:10   Into Westminster Hall, where I met with Sir H. Cholmly, and he and I to Sir Ph. Warwicke’s to speak a little about our Tangier business, but to little purpose, my Lord Treasurer being so ill that no business can be done.

1667-05-07 22:22   To bed, after hearing my wife sing, who is manifestly come to be more musical in her eare than ever I thought she could have been made, which rejoices me to the heart, for I take great delight now to hear her sing.

1667-05-07 15:52   It vexes me to see with what a company I am mixed, but then it pleases me to see that I am reckoned the chief mover among them, as they do, confess and esteem me in every thing.

1667-05-07 07:48   By coach to St. James’s; but there find Sir W. Coventry gone out betimes this morning, on horseback, with the King and Duke of York, to Putney-heath, to run some horses.

1667-05-06 22:20   I to the office, where busy late, then home to supper and sing with my wife, who do begin to give me real pleasure with her singing, and so to bed.

1667-05-06 13:13   I vexed Creed devilishly with telling him a wise man did say that he lately went into the country to Hinchingbroke; and, at his coming to town again, hath shifted his lodgings only to avoid paying to the Poll Bill, which is so true that he blushed and could not in words deny it.

1667-05-06 06:40   Up and angry with my maids for letting in watermen, and I know not who, anybody that they are acquainted with, into my kitchen to talk and prate with them, which I will not endure.

1667-05-05 16:12 r And so the child was christened; my wife, his father, and her mother, the witnesses, and the child’s name Elizabeth. So we had gloves and wine and wafers, very pretty, and talked and tattled.

1667-05-05 15:20   We went by water to Michell’s, and there his little house full of his father and mothers and the kindred, hardly any else, and mighty merry in this innocent company, and Betty mighty pretty in bed, but, her head akeing, not very merry, but the company mighty merry.

1667-05-05 13:10   To dinner, and then had a little scolding with my wife for not being fine enough to go to the christening today, which she excused by being ill, as she was indeed, and cried, but I was in an ill humour and ashamed, indeed, that she should not go dressed.

1667-05-05 10:42   Sir W. Coventry tells me the Dutch fleet shot some shot, 4 or 500, into Burnt Island in the Frith, but without any hurt; and so are gone.

1667-05-05 08:55 r He do tell me of at least six or eight fires within these few days; and continually stirs of fires, and real fires there have been, in one place or other, almost ever since the late great fire, as if there was a fate sent people for fire.

1667-05-05 08:50   I met Sir John Robinson, still a vain, prating, boasting man as any I know, as if the whole City and Kingdom had all its work done by him. He hath got a street ordered to be continued, 40 feet broad, from Paul’s through Cannon Street to the Tower, which will be very fine.

1667-05-04 10:43 r So I writ in the margin of the letter, “Returned as untrue,” and, by consent of the Board, did give it him again, and so parted.

1667-05-04 10:40   To the office, where a great conflict I had with Sir W. Warren, he bringing a letter to the Board, flatly in words charging them with their delays in passing his accounts, which have been with them these two years, part of which I said was not true, and the other undecent.

1667-05-03 22:02   News is come that the fleet of the Dutch, of about 20 ships, which come upon our coasts upon design to have intercepted our colliers, but by good luck failed, is gone to the Frith, and there lies, perhaps to trouble the Scotch privateers.

1667-05-03 21:12   My wife and I, it being a most curious clear evening, after some rain to-day, took a most excellent tour by coach to Bow, and there drank and back again.

1667-05-03 14:47 r They tell me what I did not know, that a child (as this do) will hunt and hunt up and down with its mouth if you touch the cheek of it with your finger’s end for a nipple, and fit its mouth for sucking, but this hath not sucked yet, she having no nipples.

1667-05-03 14:40   To little Michell’s, and there saw my poor Betty and her little child, which slept so soundly we could hardly wake it in an hour’s time without hurting it.

1667-05-03 10:58   I to Westminster Hall, and there took a turn with my old acquaintance Mr. Pechell, whose red nose makes me ashamed to be seen with him, though otherwise a good-natured man.

1667-05-03 09:10   To my Lord Treasurer, who continues still very ill. I had taken my stone with me on purpose, and Sir Philip Warwicke carried it in to him to see, but was not in a condition to talk with me about it, poor man.

1667-05-02 22:12   I did much business at the office, and then to my own chamber and did the like there, to my great content, but to the pain of my eyes, and then to supper and to bed, having a song with my wife with great pleasure, she doing it well.

1667-05-01 18:55 r But that which I did see, and wonder at with reason, was to find Pegg Pen in a new coach, with her husband’s pretty sister with her, both patched and very fine, and in much the finest coach in the park, for neatness and richness in gold, and everything that is noble.

1667-05-01 18:44 r I could see my Lady Newcastle was in a large black coach, adorned with silver instead of gold, and so white curtains, and every thing black and white, and herself in her cap, but other parts I could not make.

1667-05-01 18:40   Into the Park, where a horrid dust, and number of coaches, without pleasure or order. That which we, and almost all went for, was to see my Lady Newcastle; which we could not, she being followed and crowded upon by coaches all the way she went.

1667-05-01 17:13 r We sat at the upper bench next the boxes; and I find it do pretty well, and have the advantage of seeing and hearing the great people, which may be pleasant when there is good store.

1667-05-01 17:10   To the King’s playhouse, by agreement met Sir W. Pen, and saw “Love in a Maze” but a sorry play: only Lacy’s clowne’s part, which he did most admirably indeed; and I am glad to find the rogue at liberty again.

1667-05-01 14:14   Sir W. Pen did give me an account of his design of buying Sir Robert Brooke’s fine house at Wansted; which I so wondered at, and did give him reasons against it: he told me that he did intend to pull down the house and build a less, and that he should get 1500l. by the old house.

1667-05-01 11:20   To the Rose, and then had Doll Lane vener para me; but it was in a lugar mighty ouvert, so as we no poda hazer algo; so parted, and then met again at the Swan, where for la misma reason we no pode hazer, but put off to recontrar anon, which I only used as a put-off.

1667-05-01 10:45   To Westminster; in the way meeting many milk-maids with their garlands upon their pails, dancing with a fiddler before them; and saw pretty Nelly standing at her lodgings’ door in Drury-lane in her smock sleeves and bodice, looking upon one: she seemed a mighty pretty creature.

1667-05-01 08:30   To the Excise Office, and there met the Cofferer and Sir Stephen Fox. And so to discourse of my Lord Treasurer, who is better than he was of the stone, having rested this night. I did acquaint them of my knowledge of that disease, which I believe will be told my Lord Treasurer.
