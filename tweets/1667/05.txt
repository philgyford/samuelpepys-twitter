1667-05-08 13:32 r Lovett dined with me but by his discourse I see that he is a man of wit but strange experience, and acquaintance with all manner of subtleties and tricks, that I do think him not fit for me to keep any acquaintance with him, lest he some time or other show me a slippery trick.

1667-05-08 12:20   Comes Lovett with my little print of my dear Lady Castlemayne varnished, and the frame prettily done like gold, which pleases me well.

1667-05-08 12:03   I home to dinner, where I find my wife’s flageolette master, and I am so pleased with her proceeding, though she hath lost time by not practising, that I am resolved for the encouragement of the man to learn myself a little for a month or so.

1667-05-08 11:38   Going home did meet Mr. Andrews our neighbour, and did speak with him to enquire about the ground behind our house, of which I have a mind to buy enough to make a stable and coach-house; for I do see that my condition do require it.

1667-05-08 10:10   Into Westminster Hall, where I met with Sir H. Cholmly, and he and I to Sir Ph. Warwicke’s to speak a little about our Tangier business, but to little purpose, my Lord Treasurer being so ill that no business can be done.

1667-05-07 22:22   To bed, after hearing my wife sing, who is manifestly come to be more musical in her eare than ever I thought she could have been made, which rejoices me to the heart, for I take great delight now to hear her sing.

1667-05-07 15:52   It vexes me to see with what a company I am mixed, but then it pleases me to see that I am reckoned the chief mover among them, as they do, confess and esteem me in every thing.

1667-05-07 07:48   By coach to St. James’s; but there find Sir W. Coventry gone out betimes this morning, on horseback, with the King and Duke of York, to Putney-heath, to run some horses.

1667-05-06 22:20   I to the office, where busy late, then home to supper and sing with my wife, who do begin to give me real pleasure with her singing, and so to bed.

1667-05-06 13:13   I vexed Creed devilishly with telling him a wise man did say that he lately went into the country to Hinchingbroke; and, at his coming to town again, hath shifted his lodgings only to avoid paying to the Poll Bill, which is so true that he blushed and could not in words deny it.

1667-05-06 06:40   Up and angry with my maids for letting in watermen, and I know not who, anybody that they are acquainted with, into my kitchen to talk and prate with them, which I will not endure.

1667-05-05 16:12 r And so the child was christened; my wife, his father, and her mother, the witnesses, and the child’s name Elizabeth. So we had gloves and wine and wafers, very pretty, and talked and tattled.

1667-05-05 15:20   We went by water to Michell’s, and there his little house full of his father and mothers and the kindred, hardly any else, and mighty merry in this innocent company, and Betty mighty pretty in bed, but, her head akeing, not very merry, but the company mighty merry.

1667-05-05 13:10   To dinner, and then had a little scolding with my wife for not being fine enough to go to the christening today, which she excused by being ill, as she was indeed, and cried, but I was in an ill humour and ashamed, indeed, that she should not go dressed.

1667-05-05 10:42   Sir W. Coventry tells me the Dutch fleet shot some shot, 4 or 500, into Burnt Island in the Frith, but without any hurt; and so are gone.

1667-05-05 08:55 r He do tell me of at least six or eight fires within these few days; and continually stirs of fires, and real fires there have been, in one place or other, almost ever since the late great fire, as if there was a fate sent people for fire.

1667-05-05 08:50   I met Sir John Robinson, still a vain, prating, boasting man as any I know, as if the whole City and Kingdom had all its work done by him. He hath got a street ordered to be continued, 40 feet broad, from Paul’s through Cannon Street to the Tower, which will be very fine.

1667-05-04 10:43 r So I writ in the margin of the letter, “Returned as untrue,” and, by consent of the Board, did give it him again, and so parted.

1667-05-04 10:40   To the office, where a great conflict I had with Sir W. Warren, he bringing a letter to the Board, flatly in words charging them with their delays in passing his accounts, which have been with them these two years, part of which I said was not true, and the other undecent.

1667-05-03 22:02   News is come that the fleet of the Dutch, of about 20 ships, which come upon our coasts upon design to have intercepted our colliers, but by good luck failed, is gone to the Frith, and there lies, perhaps to trouble the Scotch privateers.

1667-05-03 21:12   My wife and I, it being a most curious clear evening, after some rain to-day, took a most excellent tour by coach to Bow, and there drank and back again.

1667-05-03 14:47 r They tell me what I did not know, that a child (as this do) will hunt and hunt up and down with its mouth if you touch the cheek of it with your finger’s end for a nipple, and fit its mouth for sucking, but this hath not sucked yet, she having no nipples.

1667-05-03 14:40   To little Michell’s, and there saw my poor Betty and her little child, which slept so soundly we could hardly wake it in an hour’s time without hurting it.

1667-05-03 10:58   I to Westminster Hall, and there took a turn with my old acquaintance Mr. Pechell, whose red nose makes me ashamed to be seen with him, though otherwise a good-natured man.

1667-05-03 09:10   To my Lord Treasurer, who continues still very ill. I had taken my stone with me on purpose, and Sir Philip Warwicke carried it in to him to see, but was not in a condition to talk with me about it, poor man.

1667-05-02 22:12   I did much business at the office, and then to my own chamber and did the like there, to my great content, but to the pain of my eyes, and then to supper and to bed, having a song with my wife with great pleasure, she doing it well.

1667-05-01 18:55 r But that which I did see, and wonder at with reason, was to find Pegg Pen in a new coach, with her husband’s pretty sister with her, both patched and very fine, and in much the finest coach in the park, for neatness and richness in gold, and everything that is noble.

1667-05-01 18:44 r I could see my Lady Newcastle was in a large black coach, adorned with silver instead of gold, and so white curtains, and every thing black and white, and herself in her cap, but other parts I could not make.

1667-05-01 18:40   Into the Park, where a horrid dust, and number of coaches, without pleasure or order. That which we, and almost all went for, was to see my Lady Newcastle; which we could not, she being followed and crowded upon by coaches all the way she went.

1667-05-01 17:13 r We sat at the upper bench next the boxes; and I find it do pretty well, and have the advantage of seeing and hearing the great people, which may be pleasant when there is good store.

1667-05-01 17:10   To the King’s playhouse, by agreement met Sir W. Pen, and saw “Love in a Maze” but a sorry play: only Lacy’s clowne’s part, which he did most admirably indeed; and I am glad to find the rogue at liberty again.

1667-05-01 14:14   Sir W. Pen did give me an account of his design of buying Sir Robert Brooke’s fine house at Wansted; which I so wondered at, and did give him reasons against it: he told me that he did intend to pull down the house and build a less, and that he should get 1500l. by the old house.

1667-05-01 11:20   To the Rose, and then had Doll Lane vener para me; but it was in a lugar mighty ouvert, so as we no poda hazer algo; so parted, and then met again at the Swan, where for la misma reason we no pode hazer, but put off to recontrar anon, which I only used as a put-off.

1667-05-01 10:45   To Westminster; in the way meeting many milk-maids with their garlands upon their pails, dancing with a fiddler before them; and saw pretty Nelly standing at her lodgings’ door in Drury-lane in her smock sleeves and bodice, looking upon one: she seemed a mighty pretty creature.

1667-05-01 08:30   To the Excise Office, and there met the Cofferer and Sir Stephen Fox. And so to discourse of my Lord Treasurer, who is better than he was of the stone, having rested this night. I did acquaint them of my knowledge of that disease, which I believe will be told my Lord Treasurer.
