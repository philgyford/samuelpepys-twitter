1667-04-30 21:50   I finished my accounts to my heart’s wishes and admiration, they being grown very intricate, being let alone for two months, so that I am worth now but 6700l, which is yet an infinite mercy to me, for which God make me thankful.

1667-04-30 11:10   Mr. Pierce tells me the Duke of Cambridge is very ill and full of spots about his body, that Dr. Frazier knows not what to think of it.

1667-04-30 09:09   Comes Sir John Winter to discourse with me, and asking me whether, as he had heard, I had not been cut for the stone, I took him to my closet, and there showed it to him, of which he took the dimensions and had some discourse of it, and I believe will shew my Lord Treasurer it.

1667-04-30 00:14   News is brought me that there is a great fire in Southwarke: so we up to the leads, and then I and the boy down to the end of our lane, and there saw it, it seeming pretty great, but nothing to the fire of London, that it made me think little of it.

1667-04-29 14:40   Sir G. Carteret and I alone in his closet an hour or more talking of my Lord Sandwich’s coming home, which, the peace being likely to be made here, he expects, both for my Lord’s sake and his own.

1667-04-29 13:15   I hear that the Duke of Cambridge, the Duke of York’s son, is very sick; and my Lord Treasurer very bad of the stone, and hath been so some days.

1667-04-28 18:03   To Deptford, and there I walked down the Yard, Shish and Cox with me, and discoursed about cleaning of the wet docke, and heard how, when the docke was made, a ship of near 500 tons was there found; a ship supposed of Queene Elizabeth’s time, and well wrought.

1667-04-28 16:03 r Here was a good sermon and much company, but I sleepy, and a little out of order, for my hat falling down through a hole underneath the pulpit, which, however, after sermon, by a stick, and the help of the clerke, I got up again, and then walked out of the church.

1667-04-28 15:10   By water — the day being mighty pleasant, and the tide serving finely, I up (reading in Boyle’s book of colours), as high as Barne Elmes, and there took one turn alone, and then back to Putney Church, where I saw the girls of the schools, few of which pretty.

1667-04-27 12:03   I got in some coals at 23s. per chaldron, a good bargain, I thank God, having not been put to buy a coal all this dear time, that during this war poor people have been forced to give 45s. and 50s., and 3l.

1667-04-26 17:12   I met my Lady Newcastle going with her coaches and footmen all in velvet: herself, as I have heard her often described, with her velvet cap, her hair about her ears; many black patches, because of pimples about her mouth; and naked-necked, without any thing about it.

1667-04-26 15:20   The King of France is intent upon his design against Flanders, and hath appointed the 20th of the next month for his rendezvous, and himself to prepare for the campaign the 30th, so that this, we are in hopes, will keep him in employment.

1667-04-26 12:36   Mr. Evelyn tells me that of all the great men of England there is none that endeavours more to raise those that he takes into favour than my Lord Arlington; and that he is much more to be made one’s patron than my Lord Chancellor, who never did any thing but for money!

1667-04-26 12:15 r Mr. Evelyn did tell me of the ridiculous humour of our King and Knights of the Garter, who, whereas heretofore their robes were only to be worn during their ceremonies, these, as proud of their coats, did wear them all day till night, and then rode into the Park with them on.

1667-04-26 11:50 r The King of France hath made a code to shorten the law; he hath put out all the ancient commanders of castles that were become hereditary; he hath made all the fryers subject to the bishops, which before were only subject to Rome, and so were hardly the King’s subjects.

1667-04-26 11:34 r That whore my Lady Byron, who had been, as Mr. Evelyn called it, the King’s seventeenth whore abroad, did not leave him till she had got him to give her an order for 4000l. worth of plate to be made for her; but by delays, thanks be to God! she died before she had it.

1667-04-26 11:15   With Mr. Evelyn talking of the badness of the Government, where nothing but wickedness, and wicked men and women command the King: that it is not in his nature to gainsay any thing that relates to his pleasures.

1667-04-25 13:48   My wife being to Unthanke’s christening, I to Sir W. Batten’s to dinner, where merry, and the rather because we are like to come to some good end in another of our prizes.

1667-04-24 16:03   Sir John Duncomb told me to my face that I was a very good clerk, and did understand the business and do it very well, and that he would never desire a better.

1667-04-23 18:42 r To Mrs. Martin’s, and there did hazer what I would con her, and then called my wife and to little Michell’s, where we saw the little child, which I like mightily, being I allow very pretty, and asked her how she did, being mighty glad of her doing well.

1667-04-23 15:14 r Comes in my wife, who gives me the good news that the midwife and she alone have delivered poor Betty of a pretty girl, which I am mighty glad of, and she in good condition, my wife as well as I mightily pleased with it.

1667-04-23 10:03   Word is brought me that young Michell is come to call my wife to his wife’s labour, and she went, and I at the office full of expectation what to hear from poor Betty Michell.

1667-04-22 22:05   Home to the office and did business till my eyes are sore again, and so home to sing, and then to bed, my eyes failing me mightily.

1667-04-22 16:10   Captain Cocke tells me our peace is agreed on; we are not to assist the Spanyard against the French for this year, and no restitution, and we are likely to lose Poleroone. I know not whether this be true or no, but I am for peace on any terms.

1667-04-22 10:55   By coach to the Lord Chancellor’s house, the first time I have been therein; and it is very noble, and brave pictures of the ancient and present nobility, never saw better.

1667-04-22 08:45   To White Hall to see Sir W. Coventry, returned from Portsmouth, whom I am almost ashamed to see for fear he should have been told how often I have been at plays, but it is better to see him at first than afterward.

1667-04-21 22:03   This night I do come to full resolution of diligence for a good while, and I hope God will give me the grace and wisdom to perform it.

1667-04-21 19:10 r We to coach and away to Kingsland and Islington, and there eat and drank at the Old House, and so back, it raining a little, which is mighty welcome, it having not rained in many weeks, so that they say it makes the fields just now mighty sweet.

1667-04-21 16:37 r That which we went chiefly to see was the young ladies of the schools, whereof there is great store, very pretty; and also the organ, which is handsome, and makes me mighty earnest to have a pair at our church, I having almost a mind to give them a pair.

1667-04-21 16:08 r A knight and his lady very civil to me when they come, and the like to my wife in hers, being Sir G. Viner and his lady — rich in jewells, but most in beauty — almost the finest woman that ever I saw.

1667-04-21 16:03   Took coach and to Hackney church, where very full, and found much difficulty to get pews, I offering the sexton money, and he could not help me. So my wife and Mercer ventured into a pew, and I into another.

1667-04-21 14:10   Mercer and I sung “Suo Moro,” which is one of the best pieces of music to my thinking that ever I did hear in my life.

1667-04-21 07:14 r For I have had it much in my thoughts lately that it is not too much for me now, in degree or cost, to keep a coach, but contrarily that I am almost ashamed to be seen in a hackney, and therefore if I can have the conveniency, I will secure the ground at least till peace comes.

1667-04-21 07:10   I took John, a hackney coachman whom of late I have much used, to our backgate to look upon the ground which is to be let there, where I have a mind to buy enough to build a coach-house and stable.

1667-04-20 20:27   Home, and having brought home with me from Fenchurch Street a hundred of sparrowgrass, cost 18d. We had them and a little bit of salmon, which my wife had a mind to, cost 3s.

1667-04-20 19:55   To walk in the garden with my wife, resolving by the grace of God to see no more plays till Whitsuntide, I having now seen a play every day this week till I have neglected my business, and that I am ashamed of, being found so much absent.

1667-04-20 17:36 r On which Lacy, having a cane in his hand, did give him a blow over the pate. But Howard did not do any thing but complain to the King of it; so the whole house is silenced, and the gentry seem to rejoice much at it, the house being become too insolent.

1667-04-20 17:34 r Lacy cursed him as that it was the fault of his nonsensical play that was the cause of his ill usage. Mr. Howard did give him some reply; to which Lacy answered him, that he was more a fool than a poet; upon which Howard did give him a blow on the face with his glove.

1667-04-20 17:32 r Mr. Rolt tells me the reason of no play today at the King’s house. That Lacy had been committed to the porter’s lodge for his acting his part in the late new play, and that being thence released he come to the King’s house, there met with Ned Howard, the poet of the play.

1667-04-20 17:10   With my wife to the King’s house, but there found the bill torn down and no play acted, and so being in the humour to see one, went to the Duke of York’s house, and there saw “The Witts” again, which likes me better than it did the other day, having much wit in it.

1667-04-19 22:30   I to my chamber to write a little, and then to bed, having got a mighty cold in my right eare and side of my throat, and in much trouble with it almost all the night.

1667-04-19 21:10   My wife tells me that she finds by W. Hewer that my people do observe my minding my pleasure more than usual, which I confess, and am ashamed of, and so from this day take upon me to leave it till Whit-Sunday.

1667-04-19 17:27   To the Duke’s house, not much company come, which I impute to the heat of the weather, it being very hot. Here we saw “Macbeth,” which, though I have seen it often, yet is it one of the best plays for a stage, and variety of dancing and music, that ever I saw.

1667-04-19 13:40   To Lovett’s, where I find my Lady Castlemayne’s picture not yet done, which has lain so many months there, which vexes me, but I mean not to trouble them more after this is done.

1667-04-18 21:10   Goodgroome and I did sing several things over, and tried two or three grace parts in Playford’s new book, my wife pleasing me in singing her part of the things she knew, which is a comfort to my very heart.

1667-04-18 17:30   By coach with my wife to the Duke of York’s house, and there saw “The Wits,” a play I formerly loved, and is now corrected and enlarged: but, though I like the acting, yet I like not much in the play now.

1667-04-18 10:15   The news is strong that not only the Dutch cannot set out a fleet this year, but that the French will not, and that he hath given the answer to the Dutch Embassador, saying that he is for the King of England’s having an honourable peace, which is the best news we have had.

1667-04-17 17:12 r At the door met with W. Joyce in the street, who come to our coach side, but we in haste took no notice of him, for which I was sorry afterwards, though I love not the fellow, yet for his wife’s sake.

1667-04-17 17:04   I took my wife up, and there to the King’s playhouse, and saw a piece of “Rollo,” a play I like not much, but much good acting in it: the house very empty.

1667-04-16 17:10 r I never was more taken with a play than I am with this “Silent Woman,” as old as it is, and as often as I have seen it. There is more wit in it than goes to ten new plays.

1667-04-16 14:55 r Knipp tells me the King was so angry at the liberty taken by Lacy’s part to abuse him to his face, that he commanded they should act no more, till Moone went and got leave for them to act again, but not this play.

1667-04-16 14:50   To carry my wife to see the new play I saw yesterday, she not knowing it. But there, contrary to expectation, find “The Silent Woman.” However, in; and there Knipp come into the pit. I took her by me, and here we met with Mrs. Horsley, the pretty woman.

1667-04-15 18:15   I to my new bookseller’s, and there bought “Hooker’s Polity,” the new edition, and “Dugdale’s History of the Inns of Court,” of which there was but a few saved out of the fire, and Playford’s new Catch-book, that hath a great many new fooleries in it.

1667-04-15 17:20 r The play called “The Change of Crownes;” a play of Ned Howard’s, the best that ever I saw at that house, being a great play and serious; Lacy did act the country-gentleman come up to Court, who do abuse the Court with all the imaginable wit and plainness about selling of places.

1667-04-15 14:55   I to the King’s house, where a new play, so full as I never saw it; I forced to stand close to the very door till I took cold, and many people went away for want of room. The King, and Queen, and Duke of York and Duchesse there, and all the Court, and Sir W. Coventry.

1667-04-15 08:10   Lay long in bed, and by and by called up by Sir H. Cholmly, who tells me that my Lord Middleton is for certain chosen Governor of Tangier; a man of moderate understanding, not covetous, but a soldier of fortune, and poor.

1667-04-14 20:55   Took out my wife, and the two Mercers, and two of our maids, Barker and Jane, and over the water to the Jamaica House, where I never was before, and there the girls did run for wagers over the bowling-green; and there, with much pleasure, spent little.

1667-04-14 16:32   To Margaret’s Church, and there spied Martin, and home with her, who had those, so could have ninguno placer; but fell out to see her expensefullness, having bought Turkey work, chairs, &c.

1667-04-13 22:15   Wrote to my father, who, I am glad to hear, is at some ease again, and I long to have him in town, that I may see what can be done for him here; for I would fain do all I can that I may have him live, and take pleasure in my doing well in the world.

1667-04-13 22:10   To the office, where sat all the afternoon till late at night, and then home to supper and to bed, my eyes troubling me still after candle-light, which troubles me.

1667-04-13 15:35   Come Mrs. Lowther to me to the office, and there yo did tocar su mamelles and did bezar them and su boca, which she took fort willingly, and perhaps yo posse in time a hazer mas to her.

1667-04-12 21:15   I tried my girls Mercer and Barker singly one after another, a single song, “At dead low ebb,” etc, and I do clearly find that as to manner of singing the latter do much the better.

1667-04-12 14:40   Home, to write letters and things for the dispatch of Balty away this day to sea; and after dinner he did go, I having given him much good counsel; and I have great hopes that he will make good use of it, and be a good man, for I find him willing to take pains and very sober.

1667-04-12 09:52 r I know he will be telling their family of it; though I did put on presently a very pleasant face to the boy, and spoke kindly to him, as one without passion, so as it may be he might not think I was angry, but yet I was troubled at it.

1667-04-12 09:48   Coming homeward, saw my door and hatch open, left so by Luce, our cookmaid, which so vexed me, that I did give her a kick in our entry, and offered a blow at her. I was seen doing so by Sir W. Pen’s footboy, which did vex me to the heart.

1667-04-11 21:10 r There is as much expectation of the Duchess of Newcastle coming to Court, that so people may come to see her, as if it were the Queen of Sweden; but I lost my labour, for she did not come this night.

1667-04-11 19:48 r The whole story of this lady is a romance, and all she do is romantic. Her footmen in velvet coats, and herself in an antique dress; and was the other day at her own play, “The Humourous Lovers;” the most ridiculous thing that ever was wrote.

1667-04-11 19:45   I to White Hall, thinking there to have seen the Duchess of Newcastle’s coming this night to Court, to make a visit to the Queen, the King having been with her yesterday, to make her a visit since her coming to town.

1667-04-11 18:25   Despatched the business of Balty’s 1500l. he received for the contingencies of the fleet, whereof he received about 253l. in pieces of eight, which did puzzle me for I could not tell the difference by sight, only by bigness, between a whole and half-piece and quarter-piece.

1667-04-11 09:25 r Mr. Hublon tells me that letters are come that the Dutch have stopped the fitting of their great ships, and the coming out of a fleet of theirs of 50 sail, that was ready to come out; but I doubt the truth of it yet.

1667-04-11 09:15   I to the ’Change, and there hear by Mr. Hublon of the loss of a little East Indiaman, valued at about 20,000l, coming home alone, and safe to within ten leagues of Scilly, and there snapt by a French Caper.

1667-04-10 21:10   Blessed be God! I hear that my father is better and better, and will, I hope, live to enjoy some cheerful days more; but it is strange what he writes me, that Mr. Weaver, of Huntingdon, who was a lusty, likely, and but a youngish man, should be dead.

1667-04-10 16:20   Reading a little piece I lately bought, called “The Virtuoso, or the Stoicke,” proposing many things paradoxical to our common opinions, wherein in some places he speaks well, but generally is but a sorry man.

1667-04-10 11:10   With Sir G. Carteret to the King’s little chapel; and afterwards to see the King heal the King’s Evil, wherein no pleasure, I having seen it before.

1667-04-10 09:30   I begun to discourse with Sir W. Coventry the business of Tangier, which by the removal of my Lord Bellasses, is now to have a new Governor; and did move him, that at this season all the business of reforming the garrison might be considered, while nobody was to be offended.

1667-04-09 20:55 r But Mrs. Turner and I, and others, do believe that the jewels were only disposed of by my Lady, in case she had died, to some friends of hers, and now laid there again.

1667-04-09 20:49   To Sir W. Batten’s, where he tells me how he hath found his lady’s jewels again, which have been so long lost, and a servant imprisoned and arraigned, and they were in her closet under a china cup.

1667-04-09 20:02   By water to the Old Swan, and there found Betty Michell sitting at the door, it being darkish. I staid and talked a little with her, but no osais bezar la, though she was to my thinking at this time una de las plus pretty mohers that ever I did ver in my vida.

1667-04-09 18:50   To Westminster to the Swan, and there did bezar la little mosa and hazer tocar mi thing through me chemise co su mano, at which she was enjado; but I did donar ella algo, and so all well and drank.

1667-04-09 17:23 r The best part, “Sawny,” done by Lacy, hath not half its life, by reason of the words, I suppose, not being understood, at least by me.

1667-04-09 17:20   To the King’s house, and by and by comes after me my wife with W. Hewer and his mother and Barker, and there we saw “The Tameing of a Shrew,” which hath some very good pieces in it, but generally is but a mean play.

1667-04-09 12:15 r Several do complain of abundance of land flung up by tenants out of their hands for want of ability to pay their rents; and by name, that the Duke of Buckingham hath 6000l. so flung up.

1667-04-09 12:10   I to the Exchange, and there do hear mighty cries for peace, and that otherwise we shall be undone; and yet I do suspect the badness of the peace we shall make.

1667-04-08 22:20   The first night we have been this year in the garden late, we three and our Barker singing very well, and then home to supper, and so broke up, and to bed mightily pleased with this day’s pleasure.

1667-04-08 18:28 r Thence away to Polichinello, and there had three times more sport than at the play, and so home.

1667-04-08 17:03 r My wife and I and Mercer left them in good humour, and we three to the King’s house, and saw the latter end of the “Surprisall,” a wherein was no great matter, I thought, by what I saw there.

1667-04-08 15:50 r We sat long, and very merry, and all things agreeable; and, after dinner, went out by coaches, thinking to have seen a play, but come too late to both houses.

1667-04-08 13:50 r But, Lord! to see with what envy they looked upon all my fine plate was pleasant; for I made the best shew I could, to let them understand me and my condition, to take down the pride of Mrs. Clerke, who thinks herself very great.

1667-04-08 13:10 r By and by come my guests, Dr. Clerke and his wife, and Mrs. Worshipp, and her daughter; and then Mr. Pierce and his wife, and boy, and Betty; and then I sent for Mercer; so that we had, with my wife and I, twelve at table, and very good and pleasant company.

1667-04-08 12:04   Home, and there find all things in good readiness for a good dinner, and here unexpectedly I find little Mis. Tooker, whom my wife loves not from the report of her being already naught; however, I do shew her countenance.

1667-04-08 10:40   To enquire out Mrs. Knipp’s new lodging, but could not, but do hear of her at the Playhouse. I sent for her and the jade come to me all undressed so cannot go home to my house to dinner, which I was not much troubled at because there is a distance between her and Mrs. Pierce.

1667-04-08 09:15   To the Temple, to my new bookseller’s; and there I did agree for Rycaut’s late History of the Turkish Policy, which costs me 55s; whereas it was sold plain before the late fire for 8s, and bound and coloured as this is for 20s; for I have bought it finely bound and coloured.

1667-04-08 08:01   Out, expecting to have seen the pretty daughter of the Ship taverne at the hither end of Billiter Lane. I in there to drink my morning draught of half a pint of Rhenish wine; but a mi doler ella and their family are going away thence, and a new man come to the house.

1667-04-07 21:20   The Swede’s Embassadors and our Commissioners are making all the haste they can over to the treaty for peace, and I find at Court, and particularly Lord Bellasses, says there will be a peace.

1667-04-07 18:50   Comes Mrs Turner to enquire after her son’s business, which led me to show her how false Sir W Pen is to her, whereupon she told me his promises to her and how he did show himself dissatisfied in her son’s applying himself to me, which is a good nut and a nut I will make use of.

1667-04-07 16:39   I walked into Moore Fields, and did find houses built two stories high, and like to stand; and it must become a place of great trade, till the City be built; and the street is already paved as London streets used to be, which is a strange, and to me an unpleasing sight.

1667-04-07 16:04   To Sir G. Carteret’s to talk with him about Balty’s money, and wrote a letter to Portsmouth about part of it, and then in his coach, with his little daughter Porpot (as he used to nickname her).

1667-04-07 14:40   I heard the Italian music at the Queen’s chapel, whose composition is fine, but yet the voices of eunuchs I do not like like our women, but that they do jump most excellently with themselves and their instrument, which is wonderful pleasant.

1667-04-07 09:14   Up, and when dressed with my wife (in mourning for my mother) to church both, where Mr. Mills, a lazy sermon.

1667-04-06 17:58   Captain Cocke tells me that he is confident there will be a peace, and he confides that it will take because the French and Dutch will be jealous one of another which shall give the best terms, lest the other should make the peace with us alone, to the ruin of the third.

1667-04-06 15:47   To the Exchange, and mercers and drapers, up and down, to pay all my scores occasioned by this mourning for my mother; and emptied a 50l. bag, and it was a joy to me to see that I am able to part with such a sum, without much inconvenience; at least, without any trouble of mind.

1667-04-06 09:03   Down to the Tower wharfe, there to attend the shipping of soldiers, and pretty to see how merrily some, and most go, and how sad others — the leave they take of their friends, and the terms that some wives, and other wenches asked to part with them: a pretty mixture.

1667-04-05 21:45 r Mr. Young says, which I wonder at, that I should not in all this time see, that Moorefields have houses two stories high in them, and paved streets, the City having let leases for seven years, which he do conclude will be very much to the hindering the building of the City.

1667-04-05 21:40   Mr. Young was talking about the building of the City again; and he told me that those few churches that are to be new built are plainly not chosen with regard to the convenience of the City; they stand a great many in a cluster about Cornhill.

1667-04-05 14:58   To Westminster Hall, and there bought a pair of snuffers, and saw Mrs. Howlett after her sickness come to the Hall again.

1667-04-05 10:22   I to Sir W. Pen about the business of Mrs. Turner’s son to keep his ship in employment, but so false a fellow as Sir W. Pen is I never did nor hope shall ever know again.

1667-04-05 07:30   Up, and troubled with Mr. Carcasse’s coming to speak with me, which made me give him occasion to fall into a heat, and he began to be ill-mannered to me, which made me angry.

1667-04-04 21:12 r Here I was told that at their church they have a fair pair of organs, which play while the people sing, which I am mighty glad of, wishing the like at our church at London, and would give 50l. towards it.

1667-04-04 20:34 r With them took up Mrs. Anne Jones at her mother’s door, and so to take the ayre to Hackney, where good neat’s tongue, and things to eat and drink, and very merry, the weather being mighty pleasant.

1667-04-04 18:22   Home by coach, and there took up my wife and Mercer, who had been today at White Hall to the Maundy, it being Maundy Thursday; but the King did not wash the poor people’s feet himself, but the Bishop of London did it for him.

1667-04-04 15:50   With Sir G. Cartert to my Lord Treasurer’s, and there walked with Sir Stephen Fox, talking of the sad condition of the King’s purse, and affairs thereby; and how sad the King’s life must be, to pass by his officers every hour, that are four years behind-hand unpaid.

1667-04-04 15:12   Mightily pleased I am with Sir G. Carteret’s family, and my Lady Carteret was on the bed today, having been let blood, and tells me of my Lady Jemimah’s being big-bellied.

1667-04-04 14:20   I brought Balty to the Duke of Albemarle to kiss his hand and thank him for his kindness the last year to him, and take leave of him, and then Balty and I to walk in the Park.

1667-04-04 07:04   Going down found Jervas the barber with a periwig which I had the other day cheapened at Westminster, but it being full of nits, as heretofore his work used to be, I did now refuse it, having bought elsewhere.

1667-04-03 22:10   To supper and to bed, vexed at two or three things, viz. that my wife’s watch proves so bad as it do; the ill state of the office and Kingdom’s business; at the charge which my mother’s death for mourning will bring me when all paid.

1667-04-03 17:32   By coach to my periwig maker’s and tailor’s, and so home, where I find my wife with her flageolet master, which I wish she would practise, and so to the office, and then to Sir W. Batten’s, and then to Sir W. Pen’s.

1667-04-03 11:47   I saw Prince Rupert abroad in the Vane-room, pretty well as he used to be, and looks as well, only something appears to be under his periwig on the crown of his head.

1667-04-03 11:04   I hear how the King is not so well pleased of this marriage between the Duke of Richmond and Mrs. Stewart, as is talked; and that he by a wilde did fetch her to the Beare, at the Bridge-foot, where a coach was ready, and they are stole away into Kent, without the King’s leave.

1667-04-03 10:40   With my Lady to Sir G. Carteret’s lodgings, and so up into the house, and there do hear that the Dutch letters are come, and say that the Dutch have ordered a passe to be sent for our Commissioners, and that it is now upon the way, coming with a trumpeter blinded, as is usual.

1667-04-03 09:30   To the chapel, and Dr. Crew did make a very pretty, neat, sober, honest sermon; and delivered it very readily, decently, and gravely, beyond his years: so as I was exceedingly taken with it, he being but young; but his manner of his delivery I do like exceedingly.

1667-04-02 21:15   Weary home and there to sing, but vexed with the unreadiness of the girl’s voice to learn the latter part of my song, though I confess it is very hard, half notes.

1667-04-02 12:45   Mr. Deane hath promised me a very fine draught of the Rupert, which he will make purposely for me with great perfection, which I will make one of the beautifullest things that ever was seen of the kind in the world, she being a ship that will deserve it.

1667-04-02 11:58   Up, and to the office, where all the morning sitting, and much troubled, but little business done for want of money, which makes me mighty melancholy.

1667-04-01 19:34 r But to think of the clatter they make with Sir W. Pen’s coach, and his owne fine clothes, and yet how meanly they live within doors, and nastily, and borrowing everything of neighbours is a most shitten thing.

1667-04-01 19:32   Mrs. Turner tells me odd stories how the parish talks of Sir W. Pen’s family, how poorly they clothe their daughter so soon after marriage, and do say that Mr. Lowther was married once before, and some such thing there hath been, whatever the bottom of it is.

1667-04-01 16:12   Pleased with a jolie femme that I saw going and coming in the way, which yo could aver sido contented para aver stayed with if I could have ganar acquaintance con ella, but at such times as these I am at a great loss, having not confidence, ni alguno ready wit.

1667-04-01 10:50 r I did speak to W. Coventry about Balty’s warrant, which is ready, and about being Deputy Treasurer, which he very readily and friendlily agreed to, at which I was glad.

1667-04-01 10:03 r There come Mrs. Rebecca Allen, the clerk of the rope-yard’s daughter at Chatham, who, poor heart! come to desire favour for her husband, who is clapt up, being a Lieutenant, for sending a challenge to his Captain, in the most saucy, base language that could be writ.

1667-04-01 09:37 r Sir W. Coventry flatly owns that we must have a peace, for we cannot set out a fleet; and, to use his own words, he fears that we shall soon have enough of fighting in this new way, which we have thought on for this year.

1667-04-01 09:10   To White Hall, and there had the good fortune to walk with Sir W. Coventry into the garden, and there read our melancholy letter to the Duke of York, which he likes.
