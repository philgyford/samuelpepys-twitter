1667-02-28 22:15 r So ends this month, with nothing of weight upon my mind, but for my father and mother, who are both very ill, and have been so for some weeks: whom God help! but I do fear my poor father will hardly be ever thoroughly well again.

1667-02-28 21:56 r I did within these six days see smoke still remaining of the late fire in the City; and it is strange to think how, to this very day, I cannot sleep at night without great terrors of fire.

1667-02-28 21:04   To my accounts, wherein, beyond expectation, I succeeded so well as to settle them very clear and plain, and, blessed be God; upon the evening my accounts, I do appear 6800l. creditor.

1667-02-28 19:40   Sir J. Minnes tells me that he hears for certain, that ballads are made of us in Holland for begging of a peace; which I expected, but am vexed at.

1667-02-28 13:19 r He hath been a great loser, and would be a builder again, but, he says, he knows not what restrictions there will be, so as it is unsafe for him to begin.

1667-02-28 13:17   Home and to dinner, where Mr. Holliard dined with us, and pleasant company he is. He gives it me, as his opinion, that the City will never be built again together, as is expected, while any restraint is laid upon them.

1667-02-28 09:04   Up, and there comes to me Drumbleby with a flageolet, made to suit with my former and brings me one Greeting, a master, to teach my wife. I agree by the whole with him to teach her to take out any lesson of herself for 4l.

1667-02-27 21:15   To Sir W. Pen’s, and sat with my Lady, and the young couple (Sir William out of town) talking merrily; but they make a very sorry couple, methinks, though rich.

1667-02-27 17:35   By coach, took up my wife to the Exchange, and there bought things for Mrs. Pierce’s little daughter, my Valentine, and so to their house, where we find Knipp, who also challengeth me for her Valentine. She looks well, sang well, and very merry we were for half an hour.

1667-02-27 15:22   Mr. Cooling tells me of my Lord Duke of Buckingham’s being sent for last night by a Serjeant at Armes to the Tower for treasonable practices, and that the King is infinitely angry with him, and declared him no longer one of his Council. I know not the reason of it, or occasion.

1667-02-27 12:12   Home, and there find Mr. Hunt, newly come out of the country, who tells me the country is much impoverished by the greatness of taxes: the farmers do break every day almost, and 1000l. a-year become not worth 500l.

1667-02-27 09:36 r At my asking, Mr. Pett did give me an old draught of an ancient-built ship, given him by his father, of the Beare, in Queen Elizabeth’s time. This did much please me, it being a thing I much desired to have, to shew the difference in the build of ships now and heretofore.

1667-02-27 09:27   To the Dock Yard to enquire of the state of things, and went into Mr. Pett’s; and there, beyond expectation, he did present me with a Japan cane, with a silver head, and his wife sent me by him a ring, with a Woolwich stone; now much in request.

1667-02-26 11:15   At home find Balty and his wife very fine, which I did not like, for fear he do spend too much of his money that way, and not lay up anything.

1667-02-25 16:07   At my goldsmith’s did observe the King’s new medall, where, in little, there is Mrs. Steward’s face as well done as ever I saw anything in my whole life, I think: and a pretty thing it is, that he should choose her face to represent Britannia by.

1667-02-25 07:57   Lay long in bed, talking with pleasure with my poor wife, how she used to make coal fires, and wash my foul clothes with her own hand for me, poor wretch! in our little room at my Lord Sandwich’s; for which I ought for ever to love and admire her, and do.

1667-02-24 19:40   My waterman told me how the mistress of the Beare tavern did lately fling herself into the Thames, and drowned herself; which was a most beautiful woman, as most I have seen. It seems she hath had long melancholy upon her, and hath endeavoured to make away with herself often.

1667-02-24 16:59 r So that they are, as they swear, in absolute ignorance how this fire should come; which is a strange thing, that so horrid an effect should have so mean and uncertain a beginning.

1667-02-24 16:55 r That about two in the morning they felt themselves almost choked with smoke, and rising, did find the fire coming upstairs.

1667-02-24 16:53 r Having occasion to light a candle about twelve, there was not so much fire in the bakehouse as to light a match for a candle, so that they were fain to go into another place to light it.

1667-02-24 16:50 r Asking Sir R. Viner what he thought was the cause of the fire, he tells me, that the baker, son, and his daughter, did all swear again and again, that their oven was drawn by ten o’clock at night.

1667-02-24 16:17 r Which would have certainly caused the City to be built where these Trustees pleased; whereas now, great differences will be, and the streets built by fits, and not entire till all differences be decided.

1667-02-24 16:15 r But he says that the way proposed in Parliament would have been the best, to have chosen some persons in trust, and sold the whole ground, and let it be sold again by them, with preference to the old owner.

1667-02-24 16:10   By and by comes Sir Robert Viner and my Lord Mayor to ask the King’s directions about measuring out the streets according to the new Act for building of the City, wherein the King is to be pleased.

1667-02-24 12:50   My wife tells me that little Mis. Tooker hath got a clap as young as she is, being brought up loosely by her mother – having been in bed with her mother when her mother hath had a man come into bed and lay with her.

1667-02-24 11:03   Sir W. Batten and I to church in the middle of the sermon. My Lady Pen there saluted me with great content to tell me that her daughter and husband are still in bed, as if the silly woman thought it a great matter of honour.

1667-02-24 09:20   To the Duke of York, and there presented our great letter and other papers, and among the rest my report of the victualling, which is good, I think, and will continue my pretence to the place, which I am still afeard Sir W. Coventry’s employment may extinguish.

1667-02-23 23:57   To the office again very close at it all the day till midnight, making an end and writing fair this great letter and other things to my full content, it abundantly providing for the vindication of this office, whatever the success be of our wants of money.

1667-02-23 11:45   To the office, in order to my letter to the Duke of York to-morrow, and then the office met and spent the greatest part about this letter.

1667-02-23 06:42   This day I am, by the blessing of God, 34 years old, in very good health and mind’s content, and in condition of estate much beyond whatever my friends could expect of a child of theirs, this day 34 year. The Lord’s name be praised! and may I be ever thankful for it.

1667-02-22 22:20   Home to supper and to bed, talking with my wife of the poorness and meanness of all that Sir W. Pen and the people about us do, compared with what we do.

1667-02-22 14:40 r A sorry dinner, not any thing handsome or clean, but some silver plates they borrowed of me. My wife was here too. So a great deal of talk, and I seemingly merry, but took no pleasure at all.

1667-02-22 13:04   To Sir W. Pen’s house, where some other company. It is instead of a wedding dinner for his daughter, whom I saw in palterly clothes, nothing new but a bracelet that her servant had given her, and ugly she is, as heart can wish.

1667-02-22 10:55   Up, and to the office, and then home with Sir H. Cholmly to give him some tallies upon the business of the Mole at Tangier, and then out with him by coach to the Excise Office, and so back again with him to the Exchange, and there I took another coach, and home to the office.

1667-02-21 11:50   To the Office, and there a most furious conflict between Sir W. Pen and I, in few words, of no great moment, but very bitter, and stared on one another, and so broke off; and to our business, my heart as full of spite as it could hold, for which God forgive me and him!

1667-02-20 16:14   Lord Bellasses tells me, as a grand secret, that he do believe the peace offensive and defensive between Spayne and us is quite finished, but must not be known, to prevent the King of France’s present falling upon Flanders.

1667-02-20 10:03   To the Duke of York. They talk how the King’s viallin, Bannister, is mad that the King hath a Frenchman come to be chief of some part of the King’s musique, at which the Duke of York made great mirth.

1667-02-20 08:52 r His wedding hath been so poorly kept, that I am ashamed of it; for a fellow that makes such a flutter as he do.

1667-02-20 08:50   By coach to White Hall, by the way observing Sir W. Pen’s carrying a favour to Sir W. Coventry, for his daughter’s wedding, and saying that there was others for us, when we will fetch them, which vexed me, and I am resolved not to wear it when he orders me one.

1667-02-19 16:15   After dinner I fell to read the Acts about the building of the City again; and indeed the laws seem to be very good, and I pray God I may live to see it built in that manner!

1667-02-19 13:58 r But I have not been so merry a very great while as with them, every thing pleasing me there as much as among so mean company I could be pleased.

1667-02-19 13:56   Home, and there find old Mr. Michell and Howlett come to desire mine and my wife’s company to dinner to their son’s, and so away by coach with them, it being Betty’s wedding-day a year. Here I made myself mighty merry, and a mighty pretty dinner we had in this little house.

1667-02-19 09:39   I hear that our discourse of peace is all in the dirt; for the Dutch will not like of the place, or at least the French will not agree to it; so that I do wonder what we shall do, for carry on the war we cannot.

1667-02-18 17:14 r He was mighty witty, and she also making sport with him very inoffensively, that a more pleasant rencontre I never heard. But by that means lost the pleasure of the play wholly.

1667-02-18 17:09 r He would fain know who she was, but she would not tell; yet did give him many pleasant hints of her knowledge of him, by that means setting his brains at work to find, out who she was, and did give him leave to use all means to find out who she was, but pulling off her mask.

1667-02-18 17:06 r And one of the ladies would, and did sit with her mask on, all the play, and, being exceeding witty as ever I heard woman, did talk most pleasantly with him; but was, I believe, a virtuous woman, and of quality.

1667-02-18 17:02   To the King’s house, to “The Mayd’s Tragedy;” but vexed all the while with two talking ladies and Sir Charles Sedley; yet pleased to hear their discourse, he being a stranger.

1667-02-18 14:27   To the office, where yo had Mrs. Burrows all sola a my closet, and did there besar and tocar su mamelles as much as yo quisere hasta a hazer me hazer, but ella would not suffer that yo should poner mi mano abaxo ses jupes, which yo endeavoured.

1667-02-18 09:40   To my bookbinder’s, and there mightily pleased to see some papers of the account we did give the Parliament of the expense of the Navy sewed together, which I could not have conceived before how prettily it was done.

1667-02-17 21:30   I did this day, going by water, read the answer to “The Apology for Papists,” which did like me mightily, it being a thing as well writ as I think most things that ever I read in my life, and glad I am that I read it.

1667-02-17 18:27   Colonell Reames and I walked together a great while complaining of the ill-management of things, whereof he is as full as I am. We ran over many persons and things, and see nothing done like men like to do well while the King minds his pleasures so much.

1667-02-17 15:46 r They stood to see the ganders and geese tread one another in the water, the goose being kept for a great while quite under water, which was new to me, but they did make mighty sport of it, saying “Now you shall see a marriage, between this and that,” which did not please me.

1667-02-17 15:20   I attended the King and Duke of York round the Park, and was asked several questions by both; but I was in pain, lest they should ask me what I could not answer.

1667-02-16 17:40 r But here I do first observe the fashion of drawing of mottos as well as names; so that Pierce, who drew my wife, did draw also a motto. My wife’s was, “Most virtuous and most fair;” which, as it may be used, or an anagram made upon each name, might be very pretty.

1667-02-16 17:19   To Mrs. Pierce’s, where I took up my wife, and there I find Mrs. Pierce’s little girl is my Valentine, she having drawn me; which I was not sorry for, it easing me of something more that I must have given to others.

1667-02-16 14:12 r I do believe that I could set words in English, and make musique of them more agreeable to any Englishman’s eare (the most judicious) than any Italian music set for the voice, and performed before the same man, unless he be acquainted with the Italian accent of speech.

1667-02-16 13:58 r Nor do I dote on the eunuches; they sing, indeed, pretty high, and have a mellow kind of sound, but yet I have been as well satisfied with several women’s voices and men also, as Crispe of the Wardrobe.

1667-02-16 13:56 r They sent two harpsicons before; and by and by, after tuning them, they begun; and, I confess, very good music they made; that is, the composition exceeding good, but yet not at all more pleasing to me than what I have heard in English by Mrs. Knipp, Captain Cooke, and others.

1667-02-16 13:05 r And two eunuches, so tall, that Sir T. Harvey said well that he believes they do grow large by being gelt as our oxen do, and one woman very well dressed and handsome enough, but would not be kissed, as Mr. Killigrew, who brought the company in, did acquaint us.

1667-02-16 13:03   To my Lord Bruncker’s, and there was Sir Robert Murray, a most excellent man of reason and learning, and understands the doctrine of musique. Here come Mr. Hooke, Sir George Ent, Dr. Wren, and many others; and by and by the musique, Signor Vincentio, who is the master-composer.

1667-02-16 10:57   To Westminster, and here I went to Mrs. Martin’s to thank her for her oysters and there yo did hazer tout ce que je would con her, and she grown la plus bold moher of the orbis – so that I was almost defessus of the pleasure que ego was used para tener with ella.

1667-02-16 08:14   Up, and to the office. Among other things great heat we were all in on one side or other in the examining witnesses against Mr. Carcasse about his buying of tickets, and a cunning knave I do believe he is, and will appear, though I have thought otherwise heretofore.

1667-02-15 15:30 r Mrs. Turner did give me account of this wedding today, its being private being imputed to its being just before Lent, and so in vain to make new clothes till Easter, that they might see the fashions as they are like to be this summer; which is reason good enough.

1667-02-15 13:15   Home and to dinner, where I hear Pegg Pen is married this day privately; no friends, but two or three relations on his side and hers. Borrowed many things of my kitchen for dressing their dinner.

1667-02-14 18:22 r It seems our Court are mightily for a peace, taking this to be the time to make one, while the King hath money, that he may save something of what the Parliament hath given him to put him out of debt, so as he may need the help of no more Parliaments, as to the point of money.

1667-02-14 18:10   Sir H. Cholmly and I to the Temple, and there walked in the dark in the walks talking of news; and he surprises me with the certain news that the King did last night in Council declare his being in treaty with the Dutch: that they had sent him a very civil letter.

1667-02-14 10:05   My Lord Chancellor did say, though he was, in other things, in an ill humour, that no man in England was of more method, nor made himself better understood than myself.

1667-02-14 08:20   Up and to the office, where Carcasse comes with his plaistered face, and called himself Sir W. Batten’s martyr, which made W. Batten mad almost, and mighty quarrelling there was.

1667-02-14 06:52 r But I am also this year my wife’s Valentine, and it will cost me 5l.; but that I must have laid out if we had not been Valentines.

1667-02-14 06:50   Come up to my wife’s bedside, I being up dressing myself, little Will Mercer to be her Valentine; and brought her name writ upon blue paper in gold letters, done by himself, very pretty; and we were both well pleased with it.

1667-02-13 22:37   To bed, hearing that there was a very great disorder this day at the Ticket Office, to the beating and bruising of the face of Carcasse very much.

1667-02-13 21:19   A foul evening this was to-night, and I mightily troubled to get a coach home; and, which is now my common practice, going over the ruins in the night, I rid with my sword drawn in the coach.

1667-02-13 15:38 r Dr. Clerke fell to reading a new play, newly writ, of a friend’s of his; but, by his discourse and confession afterwards, it was his own. Some things, but very few, moderately good. It being done, and commending the play, but against my judgment, only the prologue was very good.

1667-02-13 14:46 r After dinner Captain Cooke and two of his boys to sing, but it was indeed both in performance and composition most plainly below what I heard last night, which I could not have believed.

1667-02-13 14:15 r What I wondered at, Dr. Clerke did say that Sir W. Davenant is no good judge of a dramatic poem, finding fault with his choice of Henry the 5th, and others, for the stage, when I do think, and he confesses, “The Siege of Rhodes” as good as ever was writ.

1667-02-13 13:35 r Here was his wife, painted, and her sister Worshipp, a widow now and mighty pretty in her mourning. Here was also Mr. Pierce and Mr. Floyd, and Captain Cooke, to dinner, an ill and little mean one, with foul cloth and dishes, and everything poor.

1667-02-13 13:00   Took up my wife by coach, and to Mrs. Pierce’s, there to take her up, and with them to Dr. Clerke’s, by invitation, where we have not been a great while, nor had any mind to go now, but that the Dr, whom I love, would have us choose a day.

1667-02-13 10:47   Stopping at Michell’s, where Mrs. Martin was, and I there drank with them and whispered with Betty, who tells me all is well, but was prevented in something she would have said, her marido venando just then a nous which did trouble me, and so drank and parted and home.

1667-02-12 18:38 r To Mrs. Knipp’s, where the Italian is to teach her to sing her part. We all thither, and she did sing an Italian song very fine, while he played the bass upon a harpsicon; and exceedingly taken I am with her singing, and believe that she will do miracles at that and acting.

1667-02-12 16:57 r Knipp is like to make the best actor that ever come upon the stage, she understanding so well: that they are going to give her 30l. a year more. The stage is now by T. Killigrew’s pains a thousand times better and more glorious than ever heretofore.

1667-02-12 16:37 r T. Killigrew and I to talk: and he tells me how the audience at his house is not above half so much as it used to be before the late fire.

1667-02-12 16:14 r I perceive there is a proper accent in every country’s discourse, and that do reach in their setting of notes to words, which, therefore, cannot be natural to any body else but them; so that I am not so much smitten with it as I should be, if I were acquainted with their accent.

1667-02-12 15:55 r He did sing the whole from the words without any musique pricked, and played all along upon a harpsicon most admirably, and the composition most excellent.

1667-02-12 15:30   With Lord Bruncker to his house, there to hear some Italian musique: and here we met Tom Killigrew, Sir Robert Murray, and the Italian Signor Baptista, who hath composed a play in Italian for the Opera, which T. Killigrew do intend to have up; and he did sing one of the acts.

1667-02-12 14:10   Mr. Moore, in discourse, did almost convince me that it is necessary for my Lord Sandwich to come home and take his command at sea this year, for that a peace is like to be.

1667-02-11 22:02   My heart full of joy, I to the office awhile, and then home, and after supper and doing a little business in my chamber I to bed, after teaching Barker a little of my song.

1667-02-11 20:48 r I in a-doors and there find all well.

1667-02-11 20:44 r Asking who she was, the woman enquired for my house. So knowing her voice, and telling her su dona is come home she went away. I did bless myself in my good fortune in getting home before her.

1667-02-11 20:42 r This do much perplex me, and I did go presently home, and there in a sweat did walk in the entry antes my door, thinking what I should say a my femme, and as God would have it, while I was in this case, a little woman comes stumbling to the entry steps in the dark;

1667-02-11 20:28 r This did trouble me mightily, so though ella would not seem to have me trouble myself about it, yet did agree to the stopping the coach at the street’s end, and yo allais con ella home, and there presently hear by him that he had sent su maid to my house to see for her mistress.

1667-02-11 20:13 r But now comes our trouble, I did begin to fear that su marido might go to my house to enquire por ella, and there, trovando mi moher at home, would not only think himself, but give my femme occasion to think strange things.

1667-02-11 19:45 r Back to the cabinet-maker’s and there merry till my thing done, and then took coach and home, in the way tomando su mano and putting it where I used to do; which ella did suffer, but not avec tant de freedom as heretofore, I perceiving plainly she had alguns apprehensions de me.

1667-02-11 17:50 r This I was glad of, thinking to have got ella to andar to a casa de biber, but ella would not, so I did not much press it, but suffered ella to andar a la casa de uno de sos hermanos, and so I passed my time walking up and down.

1667-02-11 17:39 r I staid at Pottle’s shop till Betty Michell come and was surprised not to trover mi moher there; but I did make an excuse, and so I took ella over the water to the cabinet-maker’s, and there bought a dressing-box for her for 20s, but would require an hour’s time to make fit.

1667-02-11 11:38 r I home by water, calling at Michell’s and giving him a fair occasion to send his wife to the New Exchange to meet my wife and me this afternoon.

1667-02-11 09:37   I bought the King’s speech at proroguing the House the other day, wherein are some words which cannot but import some prospect of a peace, which God send us!

1667-02-10 19:08   Our neighbour, Mrs. Turner, poor woman, did come to take her leave of us, she being to quit her house tomorrow to my Lord Bruncker, who hath used her very unhandsomely.

1667-02-10 12:49 r We had much talk of our old acquaintance of the College, concerning their various fortunes; wherein, to my joy, I met not with any that have sped better than myself.

1667-02-10 12:15   There come Mr. Carter, my old acquaintance of Magdalene College, who hath not been here of many years. He hath spent his time in the North with the Bishop of Carlisle much. He is grown a very comely person, and of good discourse, and one that I like very much.

1667-02-09 22:27   Went home and read a piece of a play, “Every Man in his Humour,” wherein is the greatest propriety of speech that ever I read in my life: and so to bed.

1667-02-09 12:10   Come my wife’s watchmaker, and received 12l. of me for her watch; but Captain Rolt coming to speak with me about a little business, he did judge of the work to be very good work, and so I am well contented, and he hath made very good, that I knew, to Sir W. Pen and Lady Batten.

1667-02-08 14:05   At dinner we talked much of Cromwell; all saying he was a brave fellow, and did owe his crowne he got to himself as much as any man that ever got one.

1667-02-08 06:45   My brother John come up to my bedside, and took his leave of us, going this day to Brampton. My wife loves him mightily as one that is pretty harmless, and I do begin to fancy him from yesterday’s accident, it troubling me to think I should be left without a brother or sister.

1667-02-07 18:27   To the office, and there all the afternoon late doing business, and then home, and find my brother pretty well. Poor fellow! he is so melancholy, and withal, my wife says, harmless, that I begin to love him, and would be loth he should not do well.

1667-02-07 13:50   After dinner my wife and Barker fell to singing, which pleased me pretty well, my wife taking mighty pains and proud that she shall come to trill, and indeed I think she will.

1667-02-07 12:40 r My brother knew not what it was, nor ever had such a fit before. I never was so frighted but once, when my wife was ill at Ware upon the road, and I did continue trembling a good while and ready to weep to see him, he continuing mighty pale all dinner and melancholy.

1667-02-07 11:43 r I did presently lift him up from the ground, he being as pale as death; and, being upon his legs, he did presently come to himself, and said he had something come into his stomach very hot.

1667-02-07 11:40   Talking with my brother, I looking another way heard him fall down, and turned my head, and he was fallen down all along upon the ground dead, which did put me into a great fright; and, to see my brotherly love!

1667-02-06 18:22   To Westminster Hall, thinking to see Betty Michell, she staying there all night, and had hopes to get her out alone, but missed.

1667-02-06 15:02   I find Sir W. Coventry with a letter from the Downes in his hands, telling the loss of the St. Patricke coming from Harwich in her way to Portsmouth: a ship built at Bristoll the last year, of fifty guns and upwards, and a most excellent good ship.

1667-02-06 09:48   The Prince do rest well, and out of pain; so as great hopes are conceived of him. Though I did meet Dr Clerke and Mr Pierce, and they believe he will not recover it, supposing that his whole head within is eaten by this corruption, which appeared in this piece of the inner table.

1667-02-05 18:34 r I was troubled with pain, having a bruise on my right testicle. But this I did make use of to make my wife shift sides, and I did come to sit avec Betty Michell, and had her mano, which ella did give me, and did hazer whatever I voudrais avec la, which did plazer me grandement.

1667-02-05 18:04 r By coach to the New Exchange, and there laid out money, and I did give Betty Michell two pair of gloves and a dressing-box; and so home in the dark, over the ruins, with a link.

1667-02-05 17:12 r The whole play pleases me well: and most of all, the sight of many fine ladies — among others, my Lady Castlemayne and Mrs. Middleton: the latter of the two hath also a very excellent face and body, I think.

1667-02-05 17:10 r A good play I find "The Chances", and the actors most good in it; and pretty to hear Knipp sing in the play very properly, “All night I weepe;” and sung it admirably.

1667-02-05 14:20   After setting my things in order at the office I abroad with my wife and little Betty Michell, and took them against my vows, but I will make good my forfeit, to the King’s house, to show them a play, “The Chances.”

1667-02-05 08:06 r The truth is, not thinking them safe men to receive such a gratuity from, nor knowing any considerable courtesy that ever I did do them, but desirous to keep myself free from their reports, and to have it in my power to say I had refused their offer.

1667-02-05 08:04   There come to me Mr. Young and Whistler, flaggmakers, and with mighty earnestness did present me with, and press me to take a box, wherein I could not guess there was less than 100l. in gold: but I do wholly refuse it, and did not at last take it.

1667-02-05 07:04   I had a good night’s rest, the last night’s being troublesome, but now my heart light and full of resolution of standing close to my business.

1667-02-04 18:05 r Among others, Mrs. Steward, very fine, with her locks done up with puffes, as my wife calls them: and several other great ladies had their hair so, though I do not like it; but my wife do mightily — but it is only because she sees it is the fashion.

1667-02-04 18:03   My wife and I out to the Duke’s playhouse, and there saw “Heraclius,” an excellent play, to my extraordinary content; and the more from the house being very full, and great company.

1667-02-04 13:32 r So here I was mighty merry and all our differences seemingly blown over, though Sir W. Pen knows, if he be not a fool, that I love him not, and I do the like that he hates me.

1667-02-04 12:40   To dinner to Sir W. Pen’s, he inviting me and my wife, and there a pretty good dinner, intended indeed for Sir W. Coventry, but he would not stay.

1667-02-04 09:15   I do by Sir W. Coventry’s silence conclude that he is not satisfied in my management of my place and the charge it puts the King to, which I confess I am not in present condition through my late laziness to give any good answer to.

1667-02-04 08:38   I up, with my head troubled to think of the issue of this morning, so made ready and to the office, where Mr. Gawden comes, and he and I discoursed the business well, and thinks I shall get off well enough.

1667-02-03 21:15   To bed sooner than ordinary, for rising betimes in the morning tomorrow. So after reading my usual vows to bed, my mind full of trouble against tomorrow.

1667-02-03 19:20   I fell to read a little in Hakewill’s Apology, and did satisfy myself mighty fair in the truth of the saying that the world do not grow old at all, but is in as good condition in all respects as ever it was as to nature.

1667-02-03 13:56   Talking of the burning of the City; my Lady Carteret did tell us how abundance of pieces of burnt papers were cast by the wind as far as Cranborne; she took up one which was a bit of paper that had been printed, whereon there remained these words: “Time is, it is done.”

1667-02-03 09:54 r Having cut the outward table, as they call it, they find the inner all corrupted, so as it come out without any force; and their fear is, that the whole inside of his head is corrupted like that, which do yet make them afeard of him.

1667-02-03 09:50 r I hear that the work is done to the Prince in a few minutes without any pain at all to him, he not knowing when it was done. It was performed by Moulins.

1667-02-03 09:11   Talking of the Prince’s being trepanned, which was in doing just as we passed through the Stone Gallery, we asking at the door of his lodgings, and were told so. We are all full of wishes for the good success; though I dare say but few do concern ourselves for him in our hearts.

1667-02-02 22:36   So to bed. I am very well pleased this night with reading a poem I brought home with me last night from Westminster Hall, of Dryden’s upon the present war; a very good poem.

1667-02-02 21:40   This night comes home my new silver snuffe-dish, which I do give myself for my closet, which is all I purpose to bestow in plate of myself, or shall need, many a day, if I can keep what I have.

1667-02-02 20:35   Mrs. Turner come to me this night again to condole her condition and the ill usage she receives from my Lord Bruncker, which I could never have expected from him, and shall be a good caution to me while I live.

1667-02-02 14:25   Dined well, and my brother and I to write over once more with my own hand my catalogue of books, while he reads to me.

1667-02-02 11:20   Sir W. Pen looks upon me, and I on him, and speak about business together at the table well enough, but no friendship or intimacy since our late difference about his closet, nor do I desire to have any.

1667-02-02 08:50   This day I hear that Prince Rupert is to be trepanned. God give good issue to it.

1667-02-01 22:15   My brother and I did play with the bass, and I upon my viallin, which I have not seen out of the case now I think these three years, or more, having lost the key, and now forced to find an expedient to open it.

1667-02-01 18:50   To Westminster Hall, and find Doll Lane, and con ella I went to the Bell Tavern, and ibi jo did do what I would con ella as well as I could, she sedento sobra una chair and making some little resistance. But all with much content, and jo tena much plazer cum ista.

1667-02-01 16:28   Much surprised to hear this day at Deptford that Mrs. Batters is going already to be married to him, that is now the Captain of her husband’s ship. She seemed the most passionate mourner in the world. But I believe it cannot be true.

1667-02-01 16:10   I perceive the new clerk of the ’Chequer, Fownes is a very child, and is led by the nose by Cowly and his kinsman that was his clerk, but I did make him understand his duty, and put both understanding and spirit into him, so that I hope he will do well.

1667-02-01 15:32 r By and by su marido come in, and there without any notice taken by him we discoursed of our business of getting him the new ship building by Mr. Deane, which I shall do for him.

1667-02-01 15:16 r Je besa also her venter and cons and saw the poyle thereof. She would seem alguns veces very religious, but yet did permit me to hazer todo esto et quicquid amplius volebam.

1667-02-01 15:03   To Bagwell’s by appointment, where the moher erat within expecting mi venida. And did sensa alguna difficulty monter los degres and lie, comme jo desired it, upon lo lectum; and there I did la cosa con much voluptas.
