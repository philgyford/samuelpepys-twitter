1667-02-12 18:38 r To Mrs. Knipp’s, where the Italian is to teach her to sing her part. We all thither, and she did sing an Italian song very fine, while he played the bass upon a harpsicon; and exceedingly taken I am with her singing, and believe that she will do miracles at that and acting.

1667-02-12 16:57 r Knipp is like to make the best actor that ever come upon the stage, she understanding so well: that they are going to give her 30l. a year more. The stage is now by T. Killigrew’s pains a thousand times better and more glorious than ever heretofore.

1667-02-12 16:37 r T. Killigrew and I to talk: and he tells me how the audience at his house is not above half so much as it used to be before the late fire.

1667-02-12 16:14 r I perceive there is a proper accent in every country’s discourse, and that do reach in their setting of notes to words, which, therefore, cannot be natural to any body else but them; so that I am not so much smitten with it as I should be, if I were acquainted with their accent.

1667-02-12 15:55 r He did sing the whole from the words without any musique pricked, and played all along upon a harpsicon most admirably, and the composition most excellent.

1667-02-12 15:30   With Lord Bruncker to his house, there to hear some Italian musique: and here we met Tom Killigrew, Sir Robert Murray, and the Italian Signor Baptista, who hath composed a play in Italian for the Opera, which T. Killigrew do intend to have up; and he did sing one of the acts.

1667-02-12 14:10   Mr. Moore, in discourse, did almost convince me that it is necessary for my Lord Sandwich to come home and take his command at sea this year, for that a peace is like to be.

1667-02-11 22:02   My heart full of joy, I to the office awhile, and then home, and after supper and doing a little business in my chamber I to bed, after teaching Barker a little of my song.

1667-02-11 20:48 r I in a-doors and there find all well.

1667-02-11 20:44 r Asking who she was, the woman enquired for my house. So knowing her voice, and telling her su dona is come home she went away. I did bless myself in my good fortune in getting home before her.

1667-02-11 20:42 r This do much perplex me, and I did go presently home, and there in a sweat did walk in the entry antes my door, thinking what I should say a my femme, and as God would have it, while I was in this case, a little woman comes stumbling to the entry steps in the dark;

1667-02-11 20:28 r This did trouble me mightily, so though ella would not seem to have me trouble myself about it, yet did agree to the stopping the coach at the street’s end, and yo allais con ella home, and there presently hear by him that he had sent su maid to my house to see for her mistress.

1667-02-11 20:13 r But now comes our trouble, I did begin to fear that su marido might go to my house to enquire por ella, and there, trovando mi moher at home, would not only think himself, but give my femme occasion to think strange things.

1667-02-11 19:45 r Back to the cabinet-maker’s and there merry till my thing done, and then took coach and home, in the way tomando su mano and putting it where I used to do; which ella did suffer, but not avec tant de freedom as heretofore, I perceiving plainly she had alguns apprehensions de me.

1667-02-11 17:50 r This I was glad of, thinking to have got ella to andar to a casa de biber, but ella would not, so I did not much press it, but suffered ella to andar a la casa de uno de sos hermanos, and so I passed my time walking up and down.

1667-02-11 17:39 r I staid at Pottle’s shop till Betty Michell come and was surprised not to trover mi moher there; but I did make an excuse, and so I took ella over the water to the cabinet-maker’s, and there bought a dressing-box for her for 20s, but would require an hour’s time to make fit.

1667-02-11 11:38 r I home by water, calling at Michell’s and giving him a fair occasion to send his wife to the New Exchange to meet my wife and me this afternoon.

1667-02-11 09:37   I bought the King’s speech at proroguing the House the other day, wherein are some words which cannot but import some prospect of a peace, which God send us!

1667-02-10 19:08   Our neighbour, Mrs. Turner, poor woman, did come to take her leave of us, she being to quit her house tomorrow to my Lord Bruncker, who hath used her very unhandsomely.

1667-02-10 12:49 r We had much talk of our old acquaintance of the College, concerning their various fortunes; wherein, to my joy, I met not with any that have sped better than myself.

1667-02-10 12:15   There come Mr. Carter, my old acquaintance of Magdalene College, who hath not been here of many years. He hath spent his time in the North with the Bishop of Carlisle much. He is grown a very comely person, and of good discourse, and one that I like very much.

1667-02-09 22:27   Went home and read a piece of a play, “Every Man in his Humour,” wherein is the greatest propriety of speech that ever I read in my life: and so to bed.

1667-02-09 12:10   Come my wife’s watchmaker, and received 12l. of me for her watch; but Captain Rolt coming to speak with me about a little business, he did judge of the work to be very good work, and so I am well contented, and he hath made very good, that I knew, to Sir W. Pen and Lady Batten.

1667-02-08 14:05   At dinner we talked much of Cromwell; all saying he was a brave fellow, and did owe his crowne he got to himself as much as any man that ever got one.

1667-02-08 06:45   My brother John come up to my bedside, and took his leave of us, going this day to Brampton. My wife loves him mightily as one that is pretty harmless, and I do begin to fancy him from yesterday’s accident, it troubling me to think I should be left without a brother or sister.

1667-02-07 18:27   To the office, and there all the afternoon late doing business, and then home, and find my brother pretty well. Poor fellow! he is so melancholy, and withal, my wife says, harmless, that I begin to love him, and would be loth he should not do well.

1667-02-07 13:50   After dinner my wife and Barker fell to singing, which pleased me pretty well, my wife taking mighty pains and proud that she shall come to trill, and indeed I think she will.

1667-02-07 12:40 r My brother knew not what it was, nor ever had such a fit before. I never was so frighted but once, when my wife was ill at Ware upon the road, and I did continue trembling a good while and ready to weep to see him, he continuing mighty pale all dinner and melancholy.

1667-02-07 11:43 r I did presently lift him up from the ground, he being as pale as death; and, being upon his legs, he did presently come to himself, and said he had something come into his stomach very hot.

1667-02-07 11:40   Talking with my brother, I looking another way heard him fall down, and turned my head, and he was fallen down all along upon the ground dead, which did put me into a great fright; and, to see my brotherly love!

1667-02-06 18:22   To Westminster Hall, thinking to see Betty Michell, she staying there all night, and had hopes to get her out alone, but missed.

1667-02-06 15:02   I find Sir W. Coventry with a letter from the Downes in his hands, telling the loss of the St. Patricke coming from Harwich in her way to Portsmouth: a ship built at Bristoll the last year, of fifty guns and upwards, and a most excellent good ship.

1667-02-06 09:48   The Prince do rest well, and out of pain; so as great hopes are conceived of him. Though I did meet Dr Clerke and Mr Pierce, and they believe he will not recover it, supposing that his whole head within is eaten by this corruption, which appeared in this piece of the inner table.

1667-02-05 18:34 r I was troubled with pain, having a bruise on my right testicle. But this I did make use of to make my wife shift sides, and I did come to sit avec Betty Michell, and had her mano, which ella did give me, and did hazer whatever I voudrais avec la, which did plazer me grandement.

1667-02-05 18:04 r By coach to the New Exchange, and there laid out money, and I did give Betty Michell two pair of gloves and a dressing-box; and so home in the dark, over the ruins, with a link.

1667-02-05 17:12 r The whole play pleases me well: and most of all, the sight of many fine ladies — among others, my Lady Castlemayne and Mrs. Middleton: the latter of the two hath also a very excellent face and body, I think.

1667-02-05 17:10 r A good play I find "The Chances", and the actors most good in it; and pretty to hear Knipp sing in the play very properly, “All night I weepe;” and sung it admirably.

1667-02-05 14:20   After setting my things in order at the office I abroad with my wife and little Betty Michell, and took them against my vows, but I will make good my forfeit, to the King’s house, to show them a play, “The Chances.”

1667-02-05 08:06 r The truth is, not thinking them safe men to receive such a gratuity from, nor knowing any considerable courtesy that ever I did do them, but desirous to keep myself free from their reports, and to have it in my power to say I had refused their offer.

1667-02-05 08:04   There come to me Mr. Young and Whistler, flaggmakers, and with mighty earnestness did present me with, and press me to take a box, wherein I could not guess there was less than 100l. in gold: but I do wholly refuse it, and did not at last take it.

1667-02-05 07:04   I had a good night’s rest, the last night’s being troublesome, but now my heart light and full of resolution of standing close to my business.

1667-02-04 18:05 r Among others, Mrs. Steward, very fine, with her locks done up with puffes, as my wife calls them: and several other great ladies had their hair so, though I do not like it; but my wife do mightily — but it is only because she sees it is the fashion.

1667-02-04 18:03   My wife and I out to the Duke’s playhouse, and there saw “Heraclius,” an excellent play, to my extraordinary content; and the more from the house being very full, and great company.

1667-02-04 13:32 r So here I was mighty merry and all our differences seemingly blown over, though Sir W. Pen knows, if he be not a fool, that I love him not, and I do the like that he hates me.

1667-02-04 12:40   To dinner to Sir W. Pen’s, he inviting me and my wife, and there a pretty good dinner, intended indeed for Sir W. Coventry, but he would not stay.

1667-02-04 09:15   I do by Sir W. Coventry’s silence conclude that he is not satisfied in my management of my place and the charge it puts the King to, which I confess I am not in present condition through my late laziness to give any good answer to.

1667-02-04 08:38   I up, with my head troubled to think of the issue of this morning, so made ready and to the office, where Mr. Gawden comes, and he and I discoursed the business well, and thinks I shall get off well enough.

1667-02-03 21:15   To bed sooner than ordinary, for rising betimes in the morning tomorrow. So after reading my usual vows to bed, my mind full of trouble against tomorrow.

1667-02-03 19:20   I fell to read a little in Hakewill’s Apology, and did satisfy myself mighty fair in the truth of the saying that the world do not grow old at all, but is in as good condition in all respects as ever it was as to nature.

1667-02-03 13:56   Talking of the burning of the City; my Lady Carteret did tell us how abundance of pieces of burnt papers were cast by the wind as far as Cranborne; she took up one which was a bit of paper that had been printed, whereon there remained these words: “Time is, it is done.”

1667-02-03 09:54 r Having cut the outward table, as they call it, they find the inner all corrupted, so as it come out without any force; and their fear is, that the whole inside of his head is corrupted like that, which do yet make them afeard of him.

1667-02-03 09:50 r I hear that the work is done to the Prince in a few minutes without any pain at all to him, he not knowing when it was done. It was performed by Moulins.

1667-02-03 09:11   Talking of the Prince’s being trepanned, which was in doing just as we passed through the Stone Gallery, we asking at the door of his lodgings, and were told so. We are all full of wishes for the good success; though I dare say but few do concern ourselves for him in our hearts.

1667-02-02 22:36   So to bed. I am very well pleased this night with reading a poem I brought home with me last night from Westminster Hall, of Dryden’s upon the present war; a very good poem.

1667-02-02 21:40   This night comes home my new silver snuffe-dish, which I do give myself for my closet, which is all I purpose to bestow in plate of myself, or shall need, many a day, if I can keep what I have.

1667-02-02 20:35   Mrs. Turner come to me this night again to condole her condition and the ill usage she receives from my Lord Bruncker, which I could never have expected from him, and shall be a good caution to me while I live.

1667-02-02 14:25   Dined well, and my brother and I to write over once more with my own hand my catalogue of books, while he reads to me.

1667-02-02 11:20   Sir W. Pen looks upon me, and I on him, and speak about business together at the table well enough, but no friendship or intimacy since our late difference about his closet, nor do I desire to have any.

1667-02-02 08:50   This day I hear that Prince Rupert is to be trepanned. God give good issue to it.

1667-02-01 22:15   My brother and I did play with the bass, and I upon my viallin, which I have not seen out of the case now I think these three years, or more, having lost the key, and now forced to find an expedient to open it.

1667-02-01 18:50   To Westminster Hall, and find Doll Lane, and con ella I went to the Bell Tavern, and ibi jo did do what I would con ella as well as I could, she sedento sobra una chair and making some little resistance. But all with much content, and jo tena much plazer cum ista.

1667-02-01 16:28   Much surprised to hear this day at Deptford that Mrs. Batters is going already to be married to him, that is now the Captain of her husband’s ship. She seemed the most passionate mourner in the world. But I believe it cannot be true.

1667-02-01 16:10   I perceive the new clerk of the ’Chequer, Fownes is a very child, and is led by the nose by Cowly and his kinsman that was his clerk, but I did make him understand his duty, and put both understanding and spirit into him, so that I hope he will do well.

1667-02-01 15:32 r By and by su marido come in, and there without any notice taken by him we discoursed of our business of getting him the new ship building by Mr. Deane, which I shall do for him.

1667-02-01 15:16 r Je besa also her venter and cons and saw the poyle thereof. She would seem alguns veces very religious, but yet did permit me to hazer todo esto et quicquid amplius volebam.

1667-02-01 15:03   To Bagwell’s by appointment, where the moher erat within expecting mi venida. And did sensa alguna difficulty monter los degres and lie, comme jo desired it, upon lo lectum; and there I did la cosa con much voluptas.
