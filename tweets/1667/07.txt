1667-07-16 11:58   In the morning I was able to put on a wide shoe on the foot, and to the office without much pain, and there sat all the morning.

1667-07-15 19:20   I rose and eat something, where our poor Jane very sad for the death of her poor brother, who hath left a wife and two small children. I did give her 20s. in money, and what wine she needed, for the burying him.

1667-07-15 09:32 r In great pain all night long so as I was not able to go to-day to wait on the Duke of York with my fellows, but was forced in bed to write the particulars for their discourse there.

1667-07-14 22:58 r My foot begins more and more to pain me, which Mrs. Turner, by keeping her warm hand upon it, did much ease; but so that when we come home I was not able to walk from the lane’s end to my house without being helped.

1667-07-14 21:15 r Mrs. Turner mightily pleased with my resolution, which, I tell her, is never to keep a country-house, but to keep a coach, and with my wife on the Saturday to go sometimes for a day to this place, and then quit to another place.

1667-07-14 20:30 r We set out for home, the sun by and by going down, and we in the cool of the evening all the way with much pleasure home, talking and pleasing ourselves with the pleasure of this day’s work.

1667-07-14 19:10 r Through Epsum towne to our inne, in the way stopping a poor woman with her milk-pail, and in one of my gilt tumblers did drink our bellyfulls of milk, better than any creame.

1667-07-14 17:32 r We took notice of his shoes shod with iron, both at the toe and heels, and with great nails in the soles of his feet: “Why,” says the man, “the downes are full of stones, and we are faine to shoe ourselves thus; and these will make the stones fly till they sing before me.”

1667-07-14 17:27 r I made the boy read to me, which he did, with the forced tone that children do usually read, that was mighty pretty, and then I did give him something, and went to the father, and talked with him; and I find he had been a servant in my cozen Pepys’s house.

1667-07-14 17:20 r The women and W. Hewer and I walked upon the Downes, where a flock of sheep was; and the most pleasant and innocent sight that ever I saw in my life — we find a shepherd and his little boy reading, far from any houses or sight of people, the Bible to him.

1667-07-14 16:04 r I, by leaping down the little bank, coming out of the wood, did sprain my right foot, which brought me great present pain, but presently, with walking, it went away for the present.

1667-07-14 15:38 r I carried them to see my cozen Pepys’s house, and ’light, and walked round about it, and they like it, as indeed it deserves, very well, and is a pretty place.

1667-07-14 13:20 r I to my women into a better room, which the people of the house borrowed for us, and there to dinner, a good dinner, and were merry, and Pendleton come to us, who happened to be in the house, and there talked and were merry.

1667-07-14 11:37 r Here I saw Gilsthrop, Sir W. Batten’s clerk that hath been long sick, he looks like a dying man, with a consumption got, as is believed, by the pox, but God knows that the man is in a sad condition, though he finds himself much better since his coming thither, he says.

1667-07-14 10:20 r We took coach again and to the towne, to the King’s Head, where our coachman carried us, and there had an ill room for us to go into, but the best in the house that was not taken up.

1667-07-14 08:50 r We got to Epsum, to the well; where much company, and there we ’light, and I drank the water: they did not, but do go about and walk a little among the women, but I did drink four pints, and had some very good stools by it.

1667-07-14 05:30 r My wife ready; and, taking some bottles of wine, and beer, and some cold fowle with us into the coach, we took coach and four horses, which I had provided last night, and so away.

1667-07-14 05:10   Up, and my wife, a little before four, and to make us ready; and by and by Mrs. Turner come to us, by agreement, and she and I staid talking below, while my wife dressed herself, which vexed me that she was so long about it keeping us till past five o’clock before she was ready.

1667-07-13 22:15   So home, and resolved upon going to Epsum tomorrow, only for ayre, and got Mrs. Turner to go with us, and so home and to supper (after having been at the office) and to bed.

1667-07-13 13:33   Mr. Pierce dined with us, who tells us what troubles me, that my Lord Buckhurst hath got Nell away from the King’s house, lies with her, and gives her 100l. a year, so as she hath sent her parts to the house, and will act no more.

1667-07-13 10:41   My Lord Anglesey, this being the second time of his being with us, did take me aside and asked me where I lived, because he would be glad to have some discourse with me.

1667-07-13 06:40   Up pretty betimes, it being mighty hot weather, I lying this night, which I have not done, I believe, since a boy, I am sure not since I had the stone before, with only a rugg and a sheet upon me.

1667-07-12 14:52 r Insomuch, that I going to the office to avoid further anger, she followed me in a devilish manner thither, and with much ado I got her into the garden out of hearing, to prevent shame.

1667-07-12 14:47   Home, and there find my wife in a dogged humour for my not dining at home, and I did give her a pull by the nose and some ill words, which she provoked me to by something she spoke, that we fell extraordinarily out.

1667-07-12 14:15   Sir Thomas Crew and I alone, and he tells me how I am mightily in esteem with the Parliament; there being harangues made in the House to the Speaker, of Mr. Pepys’s readiness and civility to show them every thing, which I am at this time very glad of.

1667-07-12 11:02 r It is strange how every body do now-a-days reflect upon Oliver, and commend him, what brave things he did, and made all the neighbour princes fear him; while here a prince, come in with all the love of his people, hath lost all so soon.

1667-07-12 10:50 r Sir H. Cholmly do decry the King’s expenses of his Privy-purse, which in King James’s time did not rise to above 5000l. a year, and in King Charles’s to 10,000l., do now cost us above 100,000l., besides the great charge of the monarchy, as the Duke of York 100,000l. of it.

1667-07-12 10:48   While we were at the Excise office, it was computed that the Parliament had given the King for this war, besides all prizes, and besides the 200,000l. which he was to spend of his own revenue, to guard the sea above 5,000,000l. and odd 100,000l.; which is a most prodigious sum.

1667-07-12 08:32   To my chamber, there doing business, and by and by comes Greeting and begun a new month with him, and now to learn to set anything from the notes upon the flageolet, but, Lord! to see how like a fool he goes about to give me direction would make a man mad.

1667-07-11 22:10   To bed, in hopes to have all things in my office in good condition in a little time for any body to examine, which I am sure none else will.

1667-07-11 10:30   Sir T. Harvy tells me that the Council last night did sit close to determine of the King’s answer about the peace, and that though he do not certainly know, yet by all discourse yesterday he do believe it is peace.

1667-07-10 21:21   This day our girl Mary, whom Payne helped us to, did go away declaring that she must be where she might earn something one day, and spend it and play away the next. But a good civil wench, and one neither wife nor I did ever give angry word to, but she has this silly vanity.

1667-07-10 10:41   The Duke of York is come back last night from Harwich, the news he brings I know not, nor hear anything today from Dover, whether the enemy have made any attempt there as was expected.

1667-07-09 19:40   News comes for certain that the Dutch are with their fleet before Dover, and that it is expected they will attempt something there. The business of the peace is quite dashed again.

1667-07-09 09:20   Up pretty betimes and to the office, where busy till office time, and then we sat, but nothing to do but receive clamours about money.

1667-07-08 21:15   All the world being as I hear very much damped that their hopes of peace is become uncertain again.

1667-07-08 11:36 r I tried to weigh them in my arms, and find them twice as heavy as people almost twice their age; and yet I am apt to believe they are very young. If, as my Lord Ormond certifies, it be true that they are no older, it is very monstrous.

1667-07-08 11:30   To Charing Cross, there to see the great boy and girle that are lately come out of Ireland, the latter eight, the former but four years old, of most prodigious bigness for their age.

1667-07-08 10:10   Mr. Coventry is come from Bredah but brings with him articles which do not please the King: to retrench the Act of Navigation; to ascertain what are contraband goods; and that those exiled persons, who shall take refuge in their country, may be secure from further prosecution.

1667-07-08 09:02   Home, and there heard Mr. Caesar play some very good things on the lute together with myself on the violl and Greeting on the viallin.

1667-07-07 21:22 r Above all, my wife and I were the most surprised in the beauty of a plain girle, which we met in the little lane going from Redriffe-stairs into the fields, one of the prettiest faces that we think we ever saw in our lives.

1667-07-07 21:04   With my wife and Jane over to Half-way house, a very good walk; and there drank, and in the cool of the evening back again, and sang with pleasure upon the water, and were mightily pleased in hearing a boatfull of Spaniards sing.

1667-07-06 17:17 r He pulled her into a stable by the Dog tavern, and there did tumble her and toss her, calling him all the rogues and toads in the world, when she knows that elle hath suffered me to do any thing with her a hundred times.

1667-07-06 17:15 r Here happened the best instance of a woman’s falseness in the world, that her sister Doll, who went for a bottle of wine, did come home all blubbering and swearing against one Captain Vandener, a Dutchman of the Rhenish Wine House.

1667-07-06 16:38   To Mrs. Martin’s, where I met with the good news que esta no es con child, the fear of which she did give me the other day, had troubled me much. My joy in this made me send for wine, and thither come her sister and Mrs. Cragg, and I staid a good while there.

1667-07-06 12:04   Creed come to dine with us and brings the first word I hear of the news of a peace, the King having letters come to him this noon signifying that it is concluded on, and that Mr. Coventry is upon his way coming over for the King’s satisfaction.

1667-07-05 21:21   No news, but that the Dutch are gone clear from Harwich northward, and have given out they are going to Yarmouth.

1667-07-05 16:38   I am vexed to hear that Nan Wright, now Mrs. Markham, Sir W. Pen’s maid and whore, is come to sit in our pew at church, and did so while my Lady Batten was there. I confess I am very much vexed at it and ashamed.

1667-07-04 11:27 r Well, this fellow Holmes was found guilty of the act of burning the house, and other things, that he stood indicted for. The judge seems to be a worthy man, and able: and do intend, for these rogues that burned this house to be hung in some conspicuous place in the town.

1667-07-04 10:55 r But the impudence of this fellow was such, that he denied he ever saw the boys before, or ever knew the Russia House, or that the people knew him; and by and by the mistress of the Russia House was called in, being indicted.

1667-07-04 10:36 r These two boys were playing, and one rogue, Holmes, did come to them and teach them to drink, and then to bring him plate and clothes from their fathers’ houses, and carry him into their houses, and leaving open the doors for him, and at last were made of their conspiracy.

1667-07-04 10:10 r They proved against several, their consulting several times at a bawdy-house in Moore-Fields, called the Russia House, among many other rogueries, of setting houses on fire, that they might gather the goods that were flung into the streets.

1667-07-04 09:40 r Here were several trials; among others several brought in for making it their trade to set houses on fire to get plunder; and all proved by the two little boys spoken of yesterday by Sir R. Ford, who did give so good account of particulars that I never heard children in my life.

1667-07-04 09:05   I took coach and to the Sessions-house, where I have a mind to hear Bazill Fielding’s case tried; and so got up to the Bench, my Lord Chief-Justice Keeling being Judge.

1667-07-03 19:32 r She swears that the child is mine, which I do not believe, but yet do comfort her that either it cannot be so, or if it be that I will take care to send for her husband, though I do hardly see how I can be sure of that, the ship being at sea, and as far as Scotland.

1667-07-03 19:28   I to Mrs. Martin’s, but when I come, contrary to my expectation, I find her all in trouble, and what was it for but that I have got her with child for those do not venir upon her as they should have done; and is in exceeding grief.

1667-07-03 17:20 r Here I find all the news is the enemy’s landing 3,000 men near Harwich, and attacking Landguard Fort, and being beat off thence with our great guns, killing some of their men, and they leaving their ladders behind them.

1667-07-03 15:10   By water to White Hall, and there to the Council-chamber, to deliver a letter to their Lordships about the state of the six merchantmen which we have been so long fitting out.

1667-07-03 13:18 r And that one house they did set on fire in Aldersgate Street last Easter; and that this is proved by two young men, whom one of them debauched by degrees to steal their fathers’ plate and clothes, and at last to be of their company.

1667-07-03 13:15   I to Sir W. Batten’s and dined, and there comes in Sir Richard Ford, tells us how he hath been at the Sessions-house, and there it is plain that there is a combination of rogues in the town, that do make it their business to set houses on fire.

1667-07-02 21:21   Mrs. Turner tells me how she hears at the other end of the town how bad our office is spoken of by the King and Prince and Duke of Albemarle, and that there is not a good word said of any of us but of me; and me they all do speak mightily of, which I am mighty glad to hear.

1667-07-02 14:46   My wife and Jane (mighty fine the girle) to go to see Jane’s old mistress, who was to see her, and did see my wife the other day, and it is pleasant to hear with what kindness her old mistress speaks of this girl, and how she would still have her.

1667-07-02 10:22   Every thing stands still for money, while we want money to pay for some of the most necessary things that we promised ready money for in the height of our wants, as grapnells, &c.

1667-07-01 18:09   To the office, and did write to my Lord Bruncker to give me a little satisfaction about the certainty of the chain’s being broke, which I begin to doubt, and the more from Sir W. Pen’s discourse.

1667-07-01 14:34 r Home by noon, where all well, and then to dinner, and after dinner both of us laid down upon the couch and chairs and to sleep, which I did for an hour or two, and then to the office, where I am sorry to hear that Sir J. Minnes is likely to die this night.

1667-07-01 10:32 r To one Goody Best’s, a little out of the town towards London road, and thither we went with the coach, and find it a mighty clean, plain house, and had a dish of very good cream to our liking, and so away presently very merry.

1667-07-01 10:02 r We did hear a plain fellow cry out upon the folly of the King’s officers above, to spend so much money in works at Woolwich and Deptford, and sinking of good ships loaden with goods, when, if half the charge had been laid out here, it would have secured all that before now.

1667-07-01 09:40   We took coach, and, being very sleepy, droused most part of the way to Gravesend, and there ’light, and down to the new batterys, which are like to be very fine.

1667-07-01 08:58   Up betimes, waked by a damned noise between a sow gelder and a cow and a dog, nobody after we were up being able to tell us what it was.
