1667-11-08 14:00   I to my workmen, who this day come to alter my office, by beating down the wall, and making me a fayre window both there, and increasing the window of my closet, which do give me some present trouble; but will be mighty pleasant.

1667-11-08 11:50   I hear that the Duke of York is very ill; and by and by word brought us that we shall not need to attend today the Duke of York, for he is not well, which is bad news.

1667-11-07 17:12 r The most innocent play that ever I saw; and a curious piece of musique in an echo of half sentences, the echo repeating the former half, while the man goes on to the latter; which is mighty pretty. The play no great wit, but yet good, above ordinary plays.

1667-11-07 13:30   To see “The Tempest,” an old play of Shakespeare’s, acted, I hear, the first day. And so my wife, and girl, and W. Hewer by themselves, and Sir W. Pen and I afterwards by ourselves; and forced to sit in the side balcone over against the musique-room at the Duke’s house.

1667-11-06 17:20   With my wife to a play, and the girl, “Macbeth,” which we still like mightily, though mighty short of the content we used to have when Betterton acted, who is still sick.

1667-11-06 08:28   Sir G. Downing tells me that the thing the House is just now upon is that of taking away the charter from the Company of Woodmongers, whose frauds, it seems, have been mightily laid before them. He tells me that they are like to fly very high against my Lord Chancellor.

1667-11-05 12:04   Up, and all the morning at the office.

1667-11-04 11:48   I took a coach, and went to Turlington, the great spectacle-maker, for advice, who dissuades me from using old spectacles, but rather young ones, and do tell me that nothing can wrong my eyes more than for me to use reading-glasses, which do magnify much.

1667-11-04 10:55 r And this Sir H. Cholmly fears may be by divorcing the Queen and getting another, or declaring the Duke of Monmouth legitimate; which God forbid!

1667-11-04 10:52 r And that the Duke of York is troubled much, knowing that those that fling down the Chancellor cannot stop there, but will do something to him, to prevent his having it in his power hereafter to avenge himself and father-in-law upon them.

1667-11-04 10:40   Sir H. Cholmly tells me he do think really that they will cut off my Lord Chancellor’s head, the Chancellor at this day showing as much pride as is possible to those few that venture their fortunes by coming to see him.

1667-11-04 09:12 r But Sir W. Coventry do say that, if he can get out of these briars, he will never trouble himself with Princes nor Dukes again. He finds several things in their Narratives, which are both inconsistent and foolish, as well as untrue.

1667-11-04 09:04   Sir W. Coventry read over to me the Prince’s and the Duke of Albemarle’s Narratives; wherein they are severe against him and our Office. But he do contemn them; only that their persons and qualities are great, and so I do perceive is afeard of them, though he will not confess it.

1667-11-03 22:30   I to my chamber, and there busy all the evening, and then my wife and I to supper, and so to bed, with much discourse and pleasure one with another.

1667-11-03 14:10 r My cozen Roger did tell me of a bargain which I may now have in Norfolke, that Nan Pepys is going to sell, the title whereof is very good; but it is out of the way so of my life, that I shall never enjoy it, nor, it may be, see it, and so I shall have nothing to do with it.

1667-11-03 13:57   Home to dinner, whither comes by invitation Mr. Turner, the minister, and my cozen Roger brought with him Jeffrys, the apothecary at Westminster, who is our kinsman, and we had much discourse of Cottenhamshire, and other things with great pleasure.

1667-11-02 17:30 r It was observable how a gentleman of good habit, sitting just before us, eating of some fruit in the midst of the play, did drop down as dead, being choked; but with much ado Orange Moll did thrust her finger down his throat, and brought him to life again.

1667-11-02 17:27   My wife and Willett and I to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “Henry the Fourth:” and contrary to expectation, was pleased in nothing more than in Cartwright’s speaking of Falstaffe’s speech about “What is Honour?”

1667-11-01 17:40   I away home, and there took out my wife, and she and I alone to the King’s playhouse, and there saw a silly play and an old one, “The Taming of a Shrew.”

1667-11-01 11:49   I to chapel and heard a fine anthem, made by Pelham in France, of which there was great expectation, and indeed is a very good piece of musique, but still I cannot call the Anthem anything but instrumentall music with the voice, for nothing is made of the words at all.

1667-11-01 10:23 r I also visited my Lord Hinchingbroke, at his chamber at White Hall, where I found Mr. Turner, Moore, and Creed, talking of my Lord Sandwich, whose case I doubt is but bad, and, I fear, will not escape being worse, though some of the company did say otherwise.

1667-11-01 10:02   I visited Sir G. Carteret, who is vexed to see how things are likely to go, but cannot help it, and yet seems to think himself mighty safe.

1667-11-01 09:13   Sir W. Coventry’s gives me the full of the Duke of Albemarle’s and Prince’s narratives, wherein they fall foul of him and Sir G. Carteret in something about the dividing of the fleet, and the Prince particularly charging the Commissioners of the Navy with negligence.
