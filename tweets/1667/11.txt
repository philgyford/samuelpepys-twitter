1667-11-15 21:27   After supper, I got the girl to comb my head, and then to bed, my eyes bad.

1667-11-15 11:20 r Every body says he is able, but to hear how he laughs at the King’s music here, as Blagrave and others, that they cannot keep time nor tune; and that Grebus, the King’s master of the musique, how he understands nothing, nor can play on any instrument, and so cannot compose.

1667-11-15 11:15   Calling at my mercer’s and tailor’s, and there find, as I expected, Mr. Caesar and little Pelham Humphreys, lately returned from France, and is an absolute Monsieur, as full of form, and confidence, and vanity, and disparages everything, and everybody’s skill but his own.

1667-11-14 21:15   Home to supper, and to bed, my eyes being bad again; and by this means, the nights, now-a-days, do become very long to me, longer than I can sleep out.

1667-11-14 12:47   All my clerks with me to dinner, to a venison pasty; and there comes Creed, and dined with me, and he tells me how high the Lords were in the Lords’ House about the business of the Chancellor, and that they are not yet agreed to impeach him.

1667-11-13 21:17 r This I hope in God will bind me, for I do find myself mightily wronged in my reputation, and indeed in my purse and business, by my late following of my pleasure for so long time as I have done.

1667-11-13 21:15   To my chamber, and do begin anew to bind myself to keep my old vows, and among the rest not to see a play till Christmas but once in every other week, and have laid aside 10l., which is to be lost to the poor, if I do.

1667-11-13 17:27   My wife and Willet to the Duke of York’s house, and there saw the Tempest again, which is very pleasant, and full of so good variety that I cannot be more pleased almost in a comedy, only the seamen’s part a little too tedious.

1667-11-13 09:37   I met with Mr. Wren, who tells me that the Duke of York is in as good condition as is possible for a man, in his condition of the smallpox.

1667-11-12 16:58   To my office, and there saw every thing finished, so as my papers are all in order again and my office twice as pleasant as ever it was, having a noble window in my closet and another in my office, to my great content.

1667-11-12 10:50   I hear that my Lord Chancellor, to another of his Articles, that of betraying the King’s councils to his enemies, is voted to have matter against him for an impeachment of High Treason and that this day the impeachment is to be carried up to the House of Lords which is very high.

1667-11-11 21:28   This day I hear Kirton, my bookseller, poor man, is dead, I believe, of grief for his losses by the fire.

1667-11-11 19:47   We home, and there I to my office, and saw it made clean from top to bottom, till I feared I took cold in walking in a damp room while it is in washing.

1667-11-11 17:20   My wife, and I, and Willett, to the King’s play-house, and there saw “The Indian Emperour,” a good play, but not so good as people cry it up, I think, though above all things Nell’s ill speaking of a great part made me mad.

1667-11-11 13:30   I had a whole doe sent me by Mr. Hozier, which is a fine present, and I had the umbles of it for dinner.

1667-11-11 09:17 r He tells me that as soon as Secretary Morrice brought the Great Seale from my Lord Chancellor, Bab. May fell upon his knees, and catched the King about the legs and said that this was the first time that ever he could call him King of England: which was a most ridiculous saying.

1667-11-11 09:04   Sir G. Carteret and I toward the Temple in coach together; and there he did tell me how the King do all he can in the world to overthrow my Lord Chancellor, and that notice is taken of every man about the King that is not seen to promote the ruine of the Chancellor.

1667-11-10 22:00   To bed, my head running upon our businesses in Parliament and what examinations we are likely to go under before they have done with us, which troubles me more than it should a wise man and a man the best able to defend himself of our own whole office, I am apt to think.

1667-11-10 14:15   I to White Hall and there do hear that the Duke of York hath got, and is full of, the small-pox; and so we to his lodgings; and there find most of the family going to St. James’s, and the gallery doors locked up, that nobody might pass to nor fro and a sad house, I am sure.

1667-11-10 10:10   Mighty cold, and with my wife to church, where a lazy sermon. Here was my Lady Batten in her mourning at church, but I took no notice of her.

1667-11-09 20:14 r Home and to my letters by the post tonight, and there, by W. Pen, do hear that this article was overvoted in the House not to be a ground of impeachment of treason, at which I was glad, being willing to have no blood spilt, if I could help it.

1667-11-09 09:47 r He desirous to get back into the House, he having his notes in his hand, the lawyers being now speaking to the point of whether treason or not treason, the article of advising the King to break up the Parliament, and to govern by the sword.

1667-11-09 09:42 r I spoke with my cozen Roger Pepys, whose business was only to give me notice that Carcasse hath been before the Committee; and to warn me of it, which is a great courtesy in him to do, and I desire him to continue to do so.

1667-11-09 09:10   I to Westminster, and there find the House very busy, and like to be so all day, about my Lord Chancellor’s impeachment, whether treason or not, where every body is mighty busy.

1667-11-08 14:00   I to my workmen, who this day come to alter my office, by beating down the wall, and making me a fayre window both there, and increasing the window of my closet, which do give me some present trouble; but will be mighty pleasant.

1667-11-08 11:50   I hear that the Duke of York is very ill; and by and by word brought us that we shall not need to attend today the Duke of York, for he is not well, which is bad news.

1667-11-07 17:12 r The most innocent play that ever I saw; and a curious piece of musique in an echo of half sentences, the echo repeating the former half, while the man goes on to the latter; which is mighty pretty. The play no great wit, but yet good, above ordinary plays.

1667-11-07 13:30   To see “The Tempest,” an old play of Shakespeare’s, acted, I hear, the first day. And so my wife, and girl, and W. Hewer by themselves, and Sir W. Pen and I afterwards by ourselves; and forced to sit in the side balcone over against the musique-room at the Duke’s house.

1667-11-06 17:20   With my wife to a play, and the girl, “Macbeth,” which we still like mightily, though mighty short of the content we used to have when Betterton acted, who is still sick.

1667-11-06 08:28   Sir G. Downing tells me that the thing the House is just now upon is that of taking away the charter from the Company of Woodmongers, whose frauds, it seems, have been mightily laid before them. He tells me that they are like to fly very high against my Lord Chancellor.

1667-11-05 12:04   Up, and all the morning at the office.

1667-11-04 11:48   I took a coach, and went to Turlington, the great spectacle-maker, for advice, who dissuades me from using old spectacles, but rather young ones, and do tell me that nothing can wrong my eyes more than for me to use reading-glasses, which do magnify much.

1667-11-04 10:55 r And this Sir H. Cholmly fears may be by divorcing the Queen and getting another, or declaring the Duke of Monmouth legitimate; which God forbid!

1667-11-04 10:52 r And that the Duke of York is troubled much, knowing that those that fling down the Chancellor cannot stop there, but will do something to him, to prevent his having it in his power hereafter to avenge himself and father-in-law upon them.

1667-11-04 10:40   Sir H. Cholmly tells me he do think really that they will cut off my Lord Chancellor’s head, the Chancellor at this day showing as much pride as is possible to those few that venture their fortunes by coming to see him.

1667-11-04 09:12 r But Sir W. Coventry do say that, if he can get out of these briars, he will never trouble himself with Princes nor Dukes again. He finds several things in their Narratives, which are both inconsistent and foolish, as well as untrue.

1667-11-04 09:04   Sir W. Coventry read over to me the Prince’s and the Duke of Albemarle’s Narratives; wherein they are severe against him and our Office. But he do contemn them; only that their persons and qualities are great, and so I do perceive is afeard of them, though he will not confess it.

1667-11-03 22:30   I to my chamber, and there busy all the evening, and then my wife and I to supper, and so to bed, with much discourse and pleasure one with another.

1667-11-03 14:10 r My cozen Roger did tell me of a bargain which I may now have in Norfolke, that Nan Pepys is going to sell, the title whereof is very good; but it is out of the way so of my life, that I shall never enjoy it, nor, it may be, see it, and so I shall have nothing to do with it.

1667-11-03 13:57   Home to dinner, whither comes by invitation Mr. Turner, the minister, and my cozen Roger brought with him Jeffrys, the apothecary at Westminster, who is our kinsman, and we had much discourse of Cottenhamshire, and other things with great pleasure.

1667-11-02 17:30 r It was observable how a gentleman of good habit, sitting just before us, eating of some fruit in the midst of the play, did drop down as dead, being choked; but with much ado Orange Moll did thrust her finger down his throat, and brought him to life again.

1667-11-02 17:27   My wife and Willett and I to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “Henry the Fourth:” and contrary to expectation, was pleased in nothing more than in Cartwright’s speaking of Falstaffe’s speech about “What is Honour?”

1667-11-01 17:40   I away home, and there took out my wife, and she and I alone to the King’s playhouse, and there saw a silly play and an old one, “The Taming of a Shrew.”

1667-11-01 11:49   I to chapel and heard a fine anthem, made by Pelham in France, of which there was great expectation, and indeed is a very good piece of musique, but still I cannot call the Anthem anything but instrumentall music with the voice, for nothing is made of the words at all.

1667-11-01 10:23 r I also visited my Lord Hinchingbroke, at his chamber at White Hall, where I found Mr. Turner, Moore, and Creed, talking of my Lord Sandwich, whose case I doubt is but bad, and, I fear, will not escape being worse, though some of the company did say otherwise.

1667-11-01 10:02   I visited Sir G. Carteret, who is vexed to see how things are likely to go, but cannot help it, and yet seems to think himself mighty safe.

1667-11-01 09:13   Sir W. Coventry’s gives me the full of the Duke of Albemarle’s and Prince’s narratives, wherein they fall foul of him and Sir G. Carteret in something about the dividing of the fleet, and the Prince particularly charging the Commissioners of the Navy with negligence.
