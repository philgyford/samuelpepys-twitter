1667-03-08 22:23 r With one fidler we danced away the evening, but I was not well contented with the littleness of the room, and my wife’s want of preparing things ready, as they should be, for supper, and bed. So not very merry, though very well pleased.

1667-03-08 19:03   Home, and there found, as I expected, Mrs. Pierce and Mr. Batelier; he went for Mrs. Jones, but no Mrs. Knipp come, which vexed me, nor any other company.

1667-03-07 21:20   This day was reckoned by all people the coldest day that ever was remembered in England; and, God knows! coals at a very great price.

1667-03-07 17:51 r Only little Mis Davis did dance a jig after the end of the play, and there telling the next day’s play; so that it come in by force only to please the company to see her dance in boy’s clothes.

1667-03-07 17:48   To the Duke’s playhouse, and I in and find my wife and Mrs. Hewer, and sat by them and saw “The English Princesse, or Richard the Third;” a most sad, melancholy play, and pretty good; but nothing eminent in it, as some tragedys are.

1667-03-07 12:29   It is pretty to see how Commissioner Pett hugs this business, and how he favours my Lord Bruncker; who to my knowledge hates him, and has said more to his disadvantage, in my presence, to the King and Duke of York than any man in England.

1667-03-07 11:04   Commissioner Taylor come to me for advice, and would force me to take ten pieces in gold of him, which I had no mind to, he being become one of our number at the Board.

1667-03-07 09:37   Hearing that Knipp is at my house, I home, and it was about a ticket for a friend of hers. I do love the humour of the jade very well.

1667-03-06 16:58   To the ’Change, and there bought 32s. worth of things for Mrs. Knipp, my Valentine, which is pretty to see how my wife is come to convention with me, that, whatever I do give to anybody else, I shall give her as much, which I am not much displeased with.

1667-03-06 14:38   To Bagwell’s, where la moher was dentro sed would not have me demorer there parceque Mrs. Batters and one of my ancillas, I believe Jane (for she was gone abroad today), was in the town, and coming thither; so I away presently, esteeming it a great escape.

1667-03-06 11:10   To Westminster Hall. There bought some newsbooks, and, as every where else, hear every body complain of the dearness of coals, being at 4l. per chaldron, the weather, too, being become most bitter cold, the King saying today that it was the coldest day he ever knew in England.

1667-03-06 09:37 r Great preparations there are to fortify Sheernesse and the yard at Portsmouth, and forces are drawing down to both those places, and elsewhere by the seaside; so that we have some fear of an invasion.

1667-03-06 09:20 r We shall keep what fleet we have abroad in several squadrons: so that now all is come out; but we are to keep it as close as we can, without hindering the work that is to be done in preparation to this.

1667-03-06 09:03   With W. Pen to White Hall by coach. Here the Duke of York did acquaint us, and the King did the like also, afterwards coming in, with his resolution of altering the manner of the war this year.

1667-03-05 17:40 r But, Lord! to see to what a poor content any acquaintance among these people, or the people of the world, as they nowadays go, is worth; for my part I and my wife will keep to one another and let the world go hang, for there is nothing but falseness in it.

1667-03-05 17:33   To see Sir W. Batten, whose leg is all but better than it was, and like to do well. I by discourse do perceive he and his Lady are to their hearts out with my Lord Bruncker and Mrs. Williams, to which I added something, but, I think, did not venture too far with them.

1667-03-05 12:03   Up, and to the office, where met and sat all the morning, doing little for want of money, but only bear the countenance of an office.

1667-03-04 21:40   This day in the barge I took Berckenshaw’s translation of Alsted his Templum, but the most ridiculous book, as he has translated it, that ever I saw in my life, I declaring that I understood not three lines together from one end of the book to the other.

1667-03-04 20:15   I home to supper, and there mightily pleased with my wife’s beginning the flagellette, believing that she will come to very well thereon.

1667-03-04 15:27 r To Deptford, and to Bagwell’s, where I find his wife washing, and also I did hazer todo que jo voudrais con her, and then sent for her husband, and discoursed of his going to Harwich this week to his charge of the new ship building there, which I have got him.

1667-03-04 11:04 r To Woolwich, where our business was to look upon the ballast wharf there, which is offered us for the King’s use to hire, but we do not think it worth the laying out much money upon, unless we could buy the fee-simple of it, which cannot be sold us, so we wholly flung it off.

1667-03-04 09:32 r There being a hole formerly made for a drain for tarr to run into, wherein the barrel stood still, full of stinking water, Sir W. Batten did fall with one leg into it, which might have been very bad to him by breaking a leg or other hurt, but he only sprained his foot a little.

1667-03-04 08:50   Up, and with Sir J. Minnes and W. Batten by barge to Deptford, where to the King’s yard a little to look after business there, and then to a private storehouse to look upon some cordage of Sir W. Batten’s.

1667-03-03 21:30   After supper had much good discourse with W. Hewer, who supped with us, about the ticket office and the knaveries and extortions every day used there, and particularly of the business of Mr. Carcasse, whom I fear I shall find a very rogue.

1667-03-03 16:12 r Sir H. Cholmly tells me that this silly Lord hath provoked, by his ill-carriage, the Duke of York, my Lord Chancellor, and all the great persons; and therefore, most likely, will die.

1667-03-03 16:07 r And that he hath been endeavouring to have the King’s nativity calculated; which was done, and the fellow now in the Tower about it; which itself hath heretofore, as he says, been held treason, and people died for it.

1667-03-03 16:03 r Sir H. Cholmly tells me that the Duke of Buckingham his crimes, as far as he knows, are his being of a caball with some discontented persons of the late House of Commons, and opposing the desires of the King in all his matters in that House.

1667-03-03 15:28   I walked into the Park, it being a fine but very cold day; and there took two or three turns the length of the Pell Mell: and there I met Serjeant Barcroft, who was sent for the Duke of Buckingham, to have brought him prisoner to the Tower.

1667-03-03 14:46   News is this day come to the King, that the King of France is come with his army to the frontiers of Flanders, demanding leave to pass through their country towards Poland, but is denied, and thereupon that he is gone into the country.

1667-03-03 14:20   To White Hall where, walking in the galleries, I in the first place met Mr. Pierce, who tells me the story of Tom Woodall, the surgeon, killed in a drunken quarrel.

1667-03-02 22:20   To the office, where busy a while, and then home to read the lives of Henry 5th and 6th, very fine, in Speede, and to bed.

1667-03-02 17:39 r So great performance of a comical part was never, I believe, in the world before as Nell do this, both as a mad girle, then most and best of all when she comes in like a young gallant; and hath the notions and carriage of a spark the most that ever I saw any man have.

1667-03-02 17:35   To the King’s house to see “The Mayden Queene,” a new play of Dryden’s, mightily commended for the regularity of it, and the strain and wit; and there is a comical part done by Nell, which is Florimell, that I never can hope ever to see the like done again, by man or woman.

1667-03-02 10:17 r This I am glad of, not for his sake, but that it will give me a better ground, I believe, to ask something for myself of this kind, which I was fearful to begin. This do make Sir W. Pen the most kind to me that can be.

1667-03-02 10:15   Sir W. Pen did bring an order from the Duke of York for our receiving from him a small vessel for a fireship, and taking away a better of the King’s for it, it being expressed for his great service to the King.

1667-03-01 20:10   I hear today that Tom Woodall, the known chyrurgeon, is killed at Somerset House by a Frenchman, but the occasion Sir W. Batten could not tell me.

1667-03-01 12:55 r But, blessed be, it was no such thing, but a countryman come about ordinary business to me.

1667-03-01 12:50   Just before dinner one of my people come up to me, and told me a man come from Huntingdon would speak with me, how my heart come into my mouth doubting that my father, who has been long sicke, was dead.

1667-03-01 12:15   Before dinner making my wife to sing. Poor wretch! her ear is so bad that it made me angry, till the poor wretch cried to see me so vexed at her, that I think I shall not discourage her so much again, but will endeavour to make her understand sounds, and do her good that way.

1667-03-01 11:15   Being returned home, I find Greeting, the flageolet-master, come, and teaching my wife; and I do think my wife will take pleasure in it, and it will be easy for her, and pleasant. So I, as I am well content with the charge it will occasion me.

1667-03-01 10:27   In Mark Lane, I do observe, it being St. David’s day, the picture of a man dressed like a Welchman, hanging by the neck upon one of the poles that stand out at the top of one of the merchants’ houses, in full proportion, and very handsomely done.

1667-03-01 09:32   Sent for to Sir G. Carteret to discourse of the business of the Navy, and our wants, and the best way of bestowing the little money we have, which is about 30,000l, but, God knows, we have need of ten times as much, which do make my life uncomfortable on the King’s behalf.

1667-03-01 07:48   Up, it being very cold weather again after a good deal of warm summer weather, and to the office, where I settled to do much business today.
