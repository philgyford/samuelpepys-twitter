1667-03-31 22:10   The month shuts up only with great desires of peace in all of us, and a belief that we shall have a peace, in most people, if a peace can be had on any terms, for there is a necessity of it;

1667-03-31 22:08   I to supper and bed, having not had time to make up my accounts of this month at this very day, but will in a day or two, and pay my forfeit for not doing it, though business hath most hindered me.

1667-03-31 12:50   After church home to dinner, and there come Betty Michell and her husband. I do and shall love her, but, poor wretch, she is now almost ready to lie down.

1667-03-31 10:45   My tailor’s boy brings my mourning clothes home, and my wife hers and Barker’s, but they go not to church this morning. I to church, and with my mourning, very handsome, and new periwigg, make a great shew.

1667-03-30 17:45 r Here I spied Knipp and Betty, of the King’s house, and sent Knipp oranges, but, having little money about me, did not offer to carry them abroad, which otherwise I had, I fear, been tempted to.

1667-03-30 17:40   I did by coach go see the silly play of my Lady Newcastle’s, called “The Humourous Lovers;” the most silly thing that ever come upon a stage. I was sick to see it, but yet would not but have seen it, that I might the better understand her.

1667-03-30 07:20   The French periwigg maker of whom I bought two yesterday comes with them, and I am very well pleased with them.

1667-03-29 19:44   Balty tells me strange stories of his mother. Among others, how she, in his absence in Ireland, did pawne all the things that he had got in his service under Oliver, and run of her own accord, without her husband’s leave, into Flanders.

1667-03-29 18:24 r But for certain my French gun is not a thing to be used much with safety: and Truelocke do find that this very gun was never yet shot off: I was mighty satisfied with it and him, and the sight of so much curiosity of this kind.

1667-03-29 18:20   To the Bull-Head Taverne, whither Balty brought my French gun; and one Truelocke, the famous gunsmith, that is a mighty ingenious man, and he did take my gun in pieces, and made me understand the secrets thereof and upon the whole I do find it a very good piece of work.

1667-03-29 17:10   To a periwigg-maker’s of Balty’s acquaintance, and there bought two periwiggs, mighty fine; indeed, too fine, I thought, for me; but he persuaded me, and I did buy them for 4l. 10s. the two.

1667-03-29 16:45   To my shoemaker’s, cutler’s, tailor’s, and up and down about my mourning, and in my way do observe the great streets in the city are marked out with piles drove into the ground; and if ever it be built in that form with so fair streets, it will be a noble sight.

1667-03-29 15:40 r Balty do propose that it will be cheaper for him to put his wife to board at a place he is offered at Lee, and I, seeing that I am not like to be troubled with the finding a place, and having given him so much good advice, do leave them to stand and fall as they please.

1667-03-29 15:30   I home, and there find Balty and his wife got thither both by my wife for me to give them good advice, for her to be with his father and mother all this time of absence, for saving of money, and did plainly and like a friend tell them my mind of the necessity of saving money.

1667-03-28 18:40 r In going home had many good stories of Sir W. Batten and one of Sir W. Pen, the most tedious and silly and troublesome (he forcing us to hear him) that ever I heard in my life.

1667-03-28 17:05   To Blackwall and to Mr. Johnson’s, to see how some works upon our repaired ships go on, and at his house eat and drank and mighty extraordinary merry (too merry for me whose mother died so lately, but they know it not, so cannot reproach me therein, though I reproach myself).

1667-03-28 15:15 r It did grate my heart to see the poor master come on board, and look about into every corner, and find fault that she was not so clean as she used to be, though methought she was very clean; and to see his new masters come in, that had nothing to do with her, did trouble me.

1667-03-28 14:50   I down by water with Sir W. Batten, W. Pen, and R. Ford to our prize, part of whose goods were condemned yesterday — “The Lindeboome” — and there we did drink some of her wine, very good.

1667-03-28 12:35   Balty is mighty thoughtful how to dispose of his wife, and would fain have me provide a place for her, which the thoughts of what I should do with her if he should miscarry at sea makes me avoid the offering him that she should be at my house.

1667-03-27 17:22 r I found it necessary to go abroad with my wife to look after the providing mourning to send into the country for my family, being resolved to put myself and wife, and Barker and Jane, W. Hewer and Tom, in mourning, and my two under-maids, to give them hoods and scarfs and gloves.

1667-03-27 16:40 r The reading hereof did set me a-weeping heartily, and so weeping to myself awhile, and my wife also to herself, I then spoke to my wife respecting myself, and having some thoughts how much better both for her and us it is than it might have been had she outlived my father.

1667-03-27 16:32 r So I home, and there up to my wife in our chamber, and there received from my brother the news of my mother’s dying on Monday, and that the last time she spoke of her children was on Friday last, and her last words were, “God bless my poor Sam!”

1667-03-27 16:15   I to the office, where I find no letter from my father or brother, but by and by the boy tells me that his mistress sends me word that she hath opened my letter, and that she is loth to send me any more news.

1667-03-27 14:40 r The loss of so much troubles us, but we have got a pretty good part, thanks be to God! So we are not displeased nor yet have cause to triumph, as we did once expect.

1667-03-27 14:30   To the Court where Sir Ellis Layton did make a silly motion in our behalf. The judge did pronounce his sentence; for some part of the goods and ship, and the freight of the whole, to be free and returned and paid by us; and the remaining, which was the greater part, to be ours.

1667-03-27 12:05   I did go to the Swan, and there sent for Jervas, my old periwig maker, and he did bring me a periwig, but it was full of nits, so as I was troubled to see it (it being his old fault), and did send him to make it clean.

1667-03-27 11:03 r Balty is mighty glad of it, and earnest to fit himself for it, but I do find, poor man, that he is troubled how to dispose of his wife, and apparently it is out of fear of her, and his honour, and I believe he hath received some cause of this his jealousy and care.

1667-03-27 11:00   I to Westminster Hall and there met Balty, whom I had sent for, and there did break the business of my getting him the place of going again as Muster-Master with Harman this voyage to the West Indys, which indeed I do owe to Sir W. Pen.

1667-03-27 10:10 r I have heard from Sir John Bankes that it will be impossible to make the Exchequer a true bank, unless the Exchequer stood nearer the Exchange, where merchants might with ease, while they are going about their business, without trouble or loss of time, have their satisfaction.

1667-03-27 10:04   We met Sir G. Downing, and he would go with us to the Exchequer and showed us in his office his chests full and ground and shelves full of money, and says that there is 50,000l. at this day in his office of people’s money, who may demand it this day.

1667-03-26 16:05 r I am mightily pleased with the judge, who seems a very rational, learned, and uncorrupt man, and much good reading and reason there is heard in hearing of this law argued, so that the thing pleased me, though our success doth shake me.

1667-03-26 15:55 r Yet when Wiseman come to argue, yet he did so state the case, that the judge did not think fit to decide the cause tonight, but took to tomorrow, and did stagger us in our hopes, so as to make us despair of the success.

1667-03-26 15:15 r We back again to the Court, and there heard our cause pleaded; Sir Turner, Sir W. Walker, and Sir Ellis Layton being our counsel against only Sir Robert Wiseman on the other. The second of our three counsel was the best, and indeed did speak admirably, and is a very shrewd man.

1667-03-26 13:10 r Sir W. Pen and I to the Castle Tavern hard by and got a lobster, and he and I staid and eat it, and drank good wine; I only burnt wine, as my whole custom of late hath been, as an evasion, God knows, for my drinking of wine.

1667-03-26 12:03   I was called away by Sir W. Batten, and both of us in his coach (which I observe his coachman do always go now from hence towards White Hall through Tower Street, and it is the best way) to Exeter House, where the judge was sitting.

1667-03-26 11:04   St the office, where I had an opportunity to speak to Sir John Harman about my desire to have my brother Balty go again with him to sea as he did the last year, which he do seem not only contented but pleased with, which I was glad of.

1667-03-26 07:10 r But the condition I am in, in reference to my mother, makes it unfit for me to keep my usual feast. Unless it shall please God to send her well (which I despair wholly of), and then I will make amends for it by observing another day in its room.

1667-03-26 07:03 r But on my own behalf I have cause to be joyful this day, it being my usual feast day, for my being cut of the stone this day nine years, and through God’s blessing am at this day and have long been in as good condition of health as ever I was in my life or any man in England is.

1667-03-26 06:45   Much troubled in my sleep of my being crying by my mother’s bedside, laying my head over hers and crying, she almost dead and dying.

1667-03-25 21:50 r I was obliged to sup at Sir W. Pen’s, and my wife, and there counterfeited some little mirth, but my heart was sad, and so home after supper and to bed.

1667-03-25 18:05   I find letters from my brother, which tell me that yesterday when he wrote my mother did rattle in the throat so as they did expect every moment her death, which though I have a good while expected did much surprise me.

1667-03-25 17:35 r Sir W. Pen and I in the pit, and here saw “The Mayden Queene” again; which indeed the more I see the more I like, and is an excellent play, and so done by Nell, her merry part, as cannot be better done in nature, I think.

1667-03-25 14:15   To the King’s playhouse; and by and by comes Mr. Lowther and his wife and mine, and into a box, forsooth, neither of them being dressed, which I was almost ashamed of.

1667-03-25 10:10   W. Pen and I called at Mr. Lilly’s, who was working; and indeed his pictures are without doubt much beyond Mr. Hales’s, I think I may say I am convinced: but a mighty proud man he is, and full of state.

1667-03-25 09:04   W. Pen and I went over Mr. Povy’s house, which lies in the same good condition as ever, which is most extraordinary fine, and he was now at work with a cabinet-maker, making of a new inlaid table.

1667-03-25 06:50   Mightily troubled the most of the night with fears of fire, which I cannot get out of my head to this day since the last great fire.

1667-03-24 21:45   I did this night give the waterman who uses to carry me 10s. at his request, for the painting of his new boat, on which shall be my arms.

1667-03-24 16:47   I to Martin’s, where I find her within, and su hermano and la veuve Burroughs. Here I did demorar toda the afternoon bezando las and drank; and among other things, did by a trick arrive at tocando el poil de la thing de the veuve abovesaid.

1667-03-24 14:34   Balty and I did walk round the Park, I giving him my thoughts about the difficulty of getting employment for him this year, but advised him how to employ himself, and I would do what I could.

1667-03-24 10:55   Sir H. Cholmly tells me that he do believe the government of Tangier is bought by my Lord Allington for a sum of money to my Lord Arlington, and something to Lord Bellasses, who (he did tell me particularly how) is as very a false villain as ever was born.

1667-03-24 09:47 r All their care they now take is to fortify themselves, and are not ashamed of it: for when by and by my Lord Arlington come in with letters, he did move that we might do it as privately as we could, that it might not come into the Dutch Gazette presently.

1667-03-24 09:32   To the Duke of York, and there was the King also; and all our discourse was about fortifying of the Medway and Harwich, which is to be entrenched quite round, and Portsmouth: and here they advised with Sir Godfry Lloyd and Sir Bernard de Gum, the two great engineers.

1667-03-24 08:50   With Sir W. Batten to White Hall, and there I to Sir G. Carteret, who is mighty cheerful, which makes me think and by some discourse that there is expectation of a peace, but I did not ask.

1667-03-23 21:20   Vexed with our maid Luce, our cook-maid, who is a good drudging servant in everything else, and pleases us, but that she will be drunk, and hath been so last night and all this day, that she could not make clean the house. My fear is only fire.

1667-03-23 16:10   To the office again, where Mr. Moore come, who tells me that there is now no doubt made of a peace being agreed on, the King having declared this week in Council that they would treat at Bredagh.

1667-03-23 10:30   At the office, where Sir W. Pen come, returned from Chatham, from considering the means of fortifying the river Medway, by a chain at the stakes, and ships laid there with guns to keep the enemy from coming up; our care now being to fortify ourselves against their invading us.

1667-03-22 19:04   I met on Tower Hill with Captain Cocke and spent half an hour walking in the dusk of the evening with him, talking of the sorrowful condition we are in, that we must be ruined if the Parliament do not come and chastize us, that we are resolved to make a peace whatever it cost.

1667-03-22 12:12   My wife having dressed herself in a silly dress of a blue petticoat uppermost, and a white satin waistcoat and white hood, though I think she did it because her gown is gone to the tailor’s, did, together with my being hungry, which always makes me peevish, make me angry.

1667-03-22 11:04   To Westminster to Howlett’s, and there, he being not well, I sent for a quart of claret and burnt it and drank, and had a besado or three or four of Sarah, whom yo trouvais aqui.

1667-03-22 09:15   To Lovett’s and saw a few things of their doing which are pretty, but the quality of the people, living only by shifts, do not please me, that it makes me I do no more care for them, nor shall have more acquaintance with them after I have got my Lady Castlemayne’s picture home.

1667-03-21 22:30   Back to my office, and wrote an affectionate and sad letter to my father about his and my mother’s illness, and so home to supper and to bed late.

1667-03-21 20:22 r They told me they had sped, being cast and sentenced to make reparation for what we had embezzled, and they did it so well that I was much troubled at it, when Sir W. Batten asked me whether I was mortified enough, and told me we had got the day, which was mighty welcome news.

1667-03-21 19:55   Comes Sir W. Batten’s Mingo to me to pray me to come to his master and Sir Richard Ford, who have very ill news to tell me. I knew what it was, it was about our trial for a good prize today, “The Phoenix,” worth 2 or 3000l.

1667-03-21 16:43 r I confess I was well enough pleased with my seeing it: and the people did do better, without the great actors, than I did expect, but yet far short of what they do when they are there, which I was glad to find the difference of.

1667-03-21 16:40 r The play they did yesterday was so well-taken, that they thought fit to venture it publicly today; a play of my Lord Falkland’s called “The Wedding Night,” a kind of a tragedy, and some things very good in it, but the whole together, I thought, not so.

1667-03-21 14:20   To cheer myself, I alone out and to the Duke of York’s play-house, where unexpectedly I come to see only the young men and women of the house act; they having liberty to act for their own profit on Wednesdays and Fridays this Lent.

1667-03-20 21:38   To Sir W. Pen’s, where my wife was, and supped with a little, but yet little mirth, and a bad, nasty supper, which makes me not love the family, they do all things so meanly, to make a little bad show upon their backs.

1667-03-20 20:02   I met with a sad letter from my brother, who tells me my mother is declared by the doctors to be past recovery, and that my father is also very ill every hour: so that I fear we shall see a sudden change there. God fit them and us for it!

1667-03-20 17:30   Back and took up my wife; and to Polichinelli at Charing Cross, which is prettier and prettier, and so full of variety that it is extraordinary good entertainment.

1667-03-20 14:50   To the Temple, and it is strange how “Rycaut’s Discourse of Turky,” which before the fire I was asked but 8s. for, there being all but 22 or thereabouts burned, I did now offer 20s, and he demands 50s, and I think I shall give it him, though it be only as a monument of the fire.

1667-03-20 13:47   Home by water again, where I find my wife gone abroad, so I to Sir W. Batten to dinner, and had a good dinner of ling and herring pie, very good meat, best of the kind that ever I had.

1667-03-20 12:15   To Westminster Hall again, and there saw Betty Michell, and bought a pair of gloves of her, she being fain to keep shop there, her mother being sick, and her father gathering of the tax. I aime her de todo mi corazon.

1667-03-20 11:03   I had a great mind to have spoke with the King, about a business proper enough for me, but my linen was so dirty and my clothes mean, that I neither thought it fit to do that, nor go to other persons at the Court, with whom I had business, which did vex me, and I must remedy.

1667-03-20 09:38   To our church to the vestry, to be assessed by the late Poll Bill, where I am rated as an Esquire, and for my office, all will come to about 50l. But not more than I expected, nor so much by a great deal as I ought to be, for all my offices. So shall be glad to escape so.

1667-03-20 08:04   I drank at the Swan, and besado the petite moza; and so to Mrs. Martin’s who I find in opposante and su hermana rising. So here I had the opportunity para tocar tout sobra su body as I would, and did traher sus pernos out of the lecto and do hazer myself hazer.

1667-03-19 21:03   I remember to my shame how I was pleased yesterday to find the righteous maid of Magister Griffin sweeping of nostra office, ella con the Roman nariz and bon body which I did heretofore like, and do still refresh me to think que ella is come to us, that I may ver her a lo cuando.

1667-03-19 20:55   It comes in my mind this night to set down how a house was the other day in Bishopsgate Street blowed up with powder; a house that was untenanted, and between a flax shop and a        , both bad for fire; but, thanks be to God, it did no more hurt; and all do conclude it a plot.

1667-03-19 16:15   The match is concluded between the Duke of Richmond and Mrs Stewart, which I am well enough pleased with; it is pretty to consider how his quality will allay people’s talk; whereas, had a meaner person married her, he would for certain have been reckoned a cuckold at first-dash.

1667-03-19 13:50   Dined at home very pleasantly with my wife, and after dinner with a great deal of pleasure had her sing, which she begins to do with some pleasure to me, more than I expected.

1667-03-18 21:37   My father’s letter this day do tell me of his own continued illness, and that my mother grows so much worse, that he fears she cannot long continue, which troubles me very much.

1667-03-18 18:40   Sir W. Pen come and talked with me in the garden, and tells me that for certain the Duke of Richmond is to marry Mrs. Stewart, he having this day brought in an account of his estate and debts to the King on that account.

1667-03-18 16:03   Mr. Caesar told me a pretty experiment of his, of angling with a minikin, a gut-string varnished over, which keeps it from swelling, and is beyond any hair for strength and smallness. The secret I like mightily.

1667-03-18 14:13 r The truth is, if Mr. Richard Cumberland would accept of my sister’s fortune, I should give 100l. more with him than to a man able to settle her four times as much as, I fear, he is able to do; and I will think of it, and a way how to move it.

1667-03-18 14:10 r I could not spend much time with Mr. Richard Cumberland but prayed him come with his brother to dine with me; which he did do and I had a great deal of his good company; and a most excellent person he is and one that I am sorry should be lost and buried in a little country town.

1667-03-18 11:53   Comes my old good friend, Mr. Richard Cumberland, to see me, being newly come to town, whom I have not seen almost, if not quite, these seven years, in his plain country-parson’s dress.

1667-03-17 17:28   I walked into the Park and took two or three turns all alone, and then took coach and home, where I find Mercer, who I was glad to see, but durst not show so, my wife being displeased with her, and indeed I fear she is grown a very gossip.

1667-03-17 13:57   With my wife to Sir G. Carteret’s, where we dined and mightily made of, and most extraordinary people they are to continue friendship with for goodness, virtue, and nobleness and interest.

1667-03-17 11:30 r I down and took out my wife from the pew, where she was talking with a lady whom I knew not till I was gone. It was Mrs. Ashfield of Brampton, who had with much civility been, it seems, at our house to see her. I am sorry I did not show her any more respect.

1667-03-17 11:11 r I went back to White Hall, and spoke with several people till sermon was ended, which was preached by the Bishop of Hereford, that they say made an excellent sermon. He was by birth a Catholique, and a great gallant; was turned from his persuasion by the late Archbishop Laud.

1667-03-17 10:28 r I to walk in the Parke, where to the Queene’s Chapel, and there heard a fryer preach with his cord about his middle, in Portuguese, something I could understand, showing that God did respect the meek and humble, as well as the high and rich.

1667-03-17 09:57 r I put my wife into the pew below. So she being there, I to the Duke of York’s lodging, where in his dressing-chamber he talking of his journey tomorrow or next day to Harwich, to prepare some fortifications there; so that we are wholly upon the defensive part this year.

1667-03-17 09:22 r Here we took her before she was up, which I was sorry for, so only saw her, and away to chapel, leaving further visit till after sermon.

1667-03-17 09:03   To White Hall, there my wife and I the first time that ever we went to my Lady Jemimah’s chamber at Sir Edward Carteret’s lodgings. I confess I have been much to blame and much ashamed of our not visiting her sooner, but better now than never.

1667-03-16 19:20   My Lord Bruncker and I being become antagonistic, I do not think it safe for me to trust myself in the hands of one whom I know to be a knave, and using all means to become gracious there.

1667-03-16 15:15   The weather is now grown warm again, after much cold; and it is observable that within these eight days I did see smoke remaining, coming out of some cellars, from the late great fire, now above six months since.

1667-03-15 16:50   To Westminster Hall, and there spent an hour or two walking up and down, thinking para aver got out Doll Lane, sed yo no could do it, having no opportunity de hazer le, ainsi lost the todo afternoon.

1667-03-15 12:50 r The merchants do give themselves over for lost, no man knowing what to do, whether to sell or buy, not knowing whether peace or war to expect.

1667-03-15 12:30   To the ’Change, where I do hear that letters this day come to Court do tell us that we are likely not to agree, the Dutch demanding high terms, and the King of France the like, in a most braving manner.

1667-03-15 11:45   Come little Mis. Tooker, who is grown a little woman; ego had l’opportunity para besar her and tocar la abaxo con my hand. I sum certain that I should have been glad pata aver tempo and lugar to have hecho algo con her.

1667-03-14 20:04   Troubled a little at my fear that my Lord Bruncker should tell Sir W. Coventry of our neglecting the office this afternoon (which was intended) to look after our pleasures, but nothing will fall upon me alone about this.

1667-03-14 13:37 r Anon comes W. Pen with my wife and Lady Batten, and then Mr. Lowder with his mother and wife. They being come, we to oysters and so to talk, very pleasant I was all day, and anon to dinner, and I made very good company.

1667-03-14 11:04   It being a fine clear day, I did, en gayeté de cœur, propose going to Bow for ayre sake, and dine there, which they embraced, and so W. Batten and I straight to Bow, to the Queen’s Head, and there bespoke our dinner, carrying meat with us from London.

1667-03-14 10:50 r So we gone out, in went others; viz, one after another, Sir Stephen Fox for the army, Captain Cocke for sick and wounded, Mr. Ashburnham for the household.

1667-03-14 10:22 r I only did speak, laying down the state of our wants, which the King and Duke of York seemed pleased with, and we did get what we asked, 500,000l, assigned upon the eleven months’ tax: but that is not so much ready money, or what will raise 40,000l. per week, which we desired.

1667-03-14 09:40 r We fell into talk with Sir Stephen Fox, and, among other things, of the Spanish manner of walking, when three together, and shewed me how, which was pretty, to prevent differences.

1667-03-14 08:55   With Sir W. Batten and W. Pen to my Lord Treasurer’s, where we met with my Lord Bruncker an hour before the King come, and had time to talk a little of our business.

1667-03-13 20:29   To Sir W. Batten’s, where I am told that it is intended by Mr. Carcasse to pray me to be godfather with Lord Bruncker tomorrow to his child, which I suppose they tell me in mirth, but if he should ask me I know not whether I should refuse it or no.

1667-03-13 18:03 r To the Hall again, and there met Doll Lane coming out, and per contract did hazer bargain para andar to the cabaretto de vin called the Rose, and ibi I staid two hours, sed she did not venir, lequel troubled me, and so away by coach and took up my wife, and away home.

1667-03-13 17:18   To Westminster Hall, and to Martin’s, where he and she both within, and with them the widow that was once there with her when I was there, that dissembled so well to be grieved at hearing a tune that her late husband liked, but there being so much company I had no pleasure here.

1667-03-13 15:17   Mr. Holliard advises me to have my father come up to town, for he doubts else in the country he will never find ease, for, poor man, his grief is now grown so great upon him that he is never at ease, so I will have him up at Easter.

1667-03-13 13:58   To Sir G. Carteret’s, where I dined with the ladies, he not at home, and very well used I am among them, so that I am heartily ashamed that my wife hath not been there to see them; but she shall very shortly.

1667-03-13 09:14 r Mr. D. Gawden tells me a Privy-Councillor did tell him that it was said in Council that a fleet could not be set out this year, for want of victuals, which gives him and me a great alarme, but me especially for had it been so, I ought to have represented it.

1667-03-13 09:10   Meeting Mr. D. Gawden in the presence-chamber, he and I to talk; and among other things he tells me, and I do find every where else, also, that our masters do begin not to like of their councils in fitting out no fleet, but only squadrons, and are finding out excuses for it.

1667-03-12 21:47   This day a poor seaman, almost starved for want of food, lay in our yard a-dying. I sent him half-a-crown, and we ordered his ticket to be paid.

1667-03-12 11:50   Home and there find Mr. Goodgroome, whose teaching of my wife only by singing over and over again to her, and letting her sing with him, not by herself, to correct her faults, I do not like at all, but was angry at it. But I do think she will come to sing well, which pleases me.

1667-03-11 22:03   This night Mr. Carcasse did come to me again to desire favour, and that I would mediate that he might be restored, but I did give him no kind answer at all, but was very angry.

1667-03-11 14:10   To discourse of the business of the day, that is, to see Commissioner Taylor’s accounts for his ship he built, The Loyall London, and it is pretty to see how dully this old fellow makes his demands, and yet plaguy wise sayings will come from the man sometimes.

1667-03-11 13:32   Sir R. Ford did tell me that he do verily believe that the city will in few years be built again in all the greatest streets, and answered the objections I did give to it.

1667-03-11 11:15   The King of France hath advised the States of Holland, on good grounds, to refuse to treat with us at the Hague, because of having opportunity of spies, by reason of our interest in the House of Orange.

1667-03-11 09:30   Sir W. Warren come to me, to whom of late I have been very strange, partly from my finding that he is become great with my Lord Bruncker, and so I dare not trust him as I used to do, for I will not be inward with him that is open to another.

1667-03-10 22:20   Yesterday and to-day I have been troubled with a hoarseness through cold that I could not almost speak.

1667-03-10 21:40   Sir W. Pen tells me that our Mr. Turner has seen the proclamation against the Duke of Buckingham, and that therefore it is true what we heard last night.

1667-03-10 18:15   Comes Mr. Spong to see me, whose discourse about several things I proposed to him was very good, better than I have had with any body a good while.

1667-03-10 13:02   Having my cold still grown more upon me, so as I am not able to speak, I lay in bed till noon, and then up and to my chamber with a good fire, and there spent an hour on Morly’s Introduction to Music, a very good but unmethodical book.

1667-03-09 22:15   This cold did certainly come by my staying too long bare-legged yesterday morning when I rose while I looked out fresh socks and stockings, yesterday’s having in the night, lying near the window, been covered with snow within the window, which made me I durst not put them on.

1667-03-09 21:48   Captain Cocke, who was here tonight, did tell us that he is certain that yesterday a proclamation was voted at the Council, touching the proclaiming of my Lord Duke of Buckingham a traytor, and that it will be out on Monday.

1667-03-09 17:24 r And so back again straight home and there to do business, and then to Sir W. Batten’s, where W. Pen and others, and mighty merry, only I have got a great cold, and the scolding this day at the office with my Lord Bruncker hath made it worse, that I am not able to speak.

1667-03-09 16:02 r Breaking up here somewhat brokenly I home, and carried Mrs. Pierce and wife to the New Exchange, and there did give her and myself a pair of gloves, and then set her down at home.

1667-03-09 14:40   My Lord Bruncker’s did speak many severe words to me, and I returned as many to him, so that I do think there cannot for a great while, be any right peace between us, and I care not a fart for it; but however, I must look about me and mind my business.

1667-03-09 12:50   Home to dinner, where Mrs. Pierce with us and her boy (who I still find every day more and more witty beyond his age), and did dine with us, and by and by comes in her husband and a brother-in-law of his, a parson, one of the tallest biggest men that ever I saw in my life.

1667-03-08 22:23 r With one fidler we danced away the evening, but I was not well contented with the littleness of the room, and my wife’s want of preparing things ready, as they should be, for supper, and bed. So not very merry, though very well pleased.

1667-03-08 19:03   Home, and there found, as I expected, Mrs. Pierce and Mr. Batelier; he went for Mrs. Jones, but no Mrs. Knipp come, which vexed me, nor any other company.

1667-03-07 21:20   This day was reckoned by all people the coldest day that ever was remembered in England; and, God knows! coals at a very great price.

1667-03-07 17:51 r Only little Mis Davis did dance a jig after the end of the play, and there telling the next day’s play; so that it come in by force only to please the company to see her dance in boy’s clothes.

1667-03-07 17:48   To the Duke’s playhouse, and I in and find my wife and Mrs. Hewer, and sat by them and saw “The English Princesse, or Richard the Third;” a most sad, melancholy play, and pretty good; but nothing eminent in it, as some tragedys are.

1667-03-07 12:29   It is pretty to see how Commissioner Pett hugs this business, and how he favours my Lord Bruncker; who to my knowledge hates him, and has said more to his disadvantage, in my presence, to the King and Duke of York than any man in England.

1667-03-07 11:04   Commissioner Taylor come to me for advice, and would force me to take ten pieces in gold of him, which I had no mind to, he being become one of our number at the Board.

1667-03-07 09:37   Hearing that Knipp is at my house, I home, and it was about a ticket for a friend of hers. I do love the humour of the jade very well.

1667-03-06 16:58   To the ’Change, and there bought 32s. worth of things for Mrs. Knipp, my Valentine, which is pretty to see how my wife is come to convention with me, that, whatever I do give to anybody else, I shall give her as much, which I am not much displeased with.

1667-03-06 14:38   To Bagwell’s, where la moher was dentro sed would not have me demorer there parceque Mrs. Batters and one of my ancillas, I believe Jane (for she was gone abroad today), was in the town, and coming thither; so I away presently, esteeming it a great escape.

1667-03-06 11:10   To Westminster Hall. There bought some newsbooks, and, as every where else, hear every body complain of the dearness of coals, being at 4l. per chaldron, the weather, too, being become most bitter cold, the King saying today that it was the coldest day he ever knew in England.

1667-03-06 09:37 r Great preparations there are to fortify Sheernesse and the yard at Portsmouth, and forces are drawing down to both those places, and elsewhere by the seaside; so that we have some fear of an invasion.

1667-03-06 09:20 r We shall keep what fleet we have abroad in several squadrons: so that now all is come out; but we are to keep it as close as we can, without hindering the work that is to be done in preparation to this.

1667-03-06 09:03   With W. Pen to White Hall by coach. Here the Duke of York did acquaint us, and the King did the like also, afterwards coming in, with his resolution of altering the manner of the war this year.

1667-03-05 17:40 r But, Lord! to see to what a poor content any acquaintance among these people, or the people of the world, as they nowadays go, is worth; for my part I and my wife will keep to one another and let the world go hang, for there is nothing but falseness in it.

1667-03-05 17:33   To see Sir W. Batten, whose leg is all but better than it was, and like to do well. I by discourse do perceive he and his Lady are to their hearts out with my Lord Bruncker and Mrs. Williams, to which I added something, but, I think, did not venture too far with them.

1667-03-05 12:03   Up, and to the office, where met and sat all the morning, doing little for want of money, but only bear the countenance of an office.

1667-03-04 21:40   This day in the barge I took Berckenshaw’s translation of Alsted his Templum, but the most ridiculous book, as he has translated it, that ever I saw in my life, I declaring that I understood not three lines together from one end of the book to the other.

1667-03-04 20:15   I home to supper, and there mightily pleased with my wife’s beginning the flagellette, believing that she will come to very well thereon.

1667-03-04 15:27 r To Deptford, and to Bagwell’s, where I find his wife washing, and also I did hazer todo que jo voudrais con her, and then sent for her husband, and discoursed of his going to Harwich this week to his charge of the new ship building there, which I have got him.

1667-03-04 11:04 r To Woolwich, where our business was to look upon the ballast wharf there, which is offered us for the King’s use to hire, but we do not think it worth the laying out much money upon, unless we could buy the fee-simple of it, which cannot be sold us, so we wholly flung it off.

1667-03-04 09:32 r There being a hole formerly made for a drain for tarr to run into, wherein the barrel stood still, full of stinking water, Sir W. Batten did fall with one leg into it, which might have been very bad to him by breaking a leg or other hurt, but he only sprained his foot a little.

1667-03-04 08:50   Up, and with Sir J. Minnes and W. Batten by barge to Deptford, where to the King’s yard a little to look after business there, and then to a private storehouse to look upon some cordage of Sir W. Batten’s.

1667-03-03 21:30   After supper had much good discourse with W. Hewer, who supped with us, about the ticket office and the knaveries and extortions every day used there, and particularly of the business of Mr. Carcasse, whom I fear I shall find a very rogue.

1667-03-03 16:12 r Sir H. Cholmly tells me that this silly Lord hath provoked, by his ill-carriage, the Duke of York, my Lord Chancellor, and all the great persons; and therefore, most likely, will die.

1667-03-03 16:07 r And that he hath been endeavouring to have the King’s nativity calculated; which was done, and the fellow now in the Tower about it; which itself hath heretofore, as he says, been held treason, and people died for it.

1667-03-03 16:03 r Sir H. Cholmly tells me that the Duke of Buckingham his crimes, as far as he knows, are his being of a caball with some discontented persons of the late House of Commons, and opposing the desires of the King in all his matters in that House.

1667-03-03 15:28   I walked into the Park, it being a fine but very cold day; and there took two or three turns the length of the Pell Mell: and there I met Serjeant Barcroft, who was sent for the Duke of Buckingham, to have brought him prisoner to the Tower.

1667-03-03 14:46   News is this day come to the King, that the King of France is come with his army to the frontiers of Flanders, demanding leave to pass through their country towards Poland, but is denied, and thereupon that he is gone into the country.

1667-03-03 14:20   To White Hall where, walking in the galleries, I in the first place met Mr. Pierce, who tells me the story of Tom Woodall, the surgeon, killed in a drunken quarrel.

1667-03-02 22:20   To the office, where busy a while, and then home to read the lives of Henry 5th and 6th, very fine, in Speede, and to bed.

1667-03-02 17:39 r So great performance of a comical part was never, I believe, in the world before as Nell do this, both as a mad girle, then most and best of all when she comes in like a young gallant; and hath the notions and carriage of a spark the most that ever I saw any man have.

1667-03-02 17:35   To the King’s house to see “The Mayden Queene,” a new play of Dryden’s, mightily commended for the regularity of it, and the strain and wit; and there is a comical part done by Nell, which is Florimell, that I never can hope ever to see the like done again, by man or woman.

1667-03-02 10:17 r This I am glad of, not for his sake, but that it will give me a better ground, I believe, to ask something for myself of this kind, which I was fearful to begin. This do make Sir W. Pen the most kind to me that can be.

1667-03-02 10:15   Sir W. Pen did bring an order from the Duke of York for our receiving from him a small vessel for a fireship, and taking away a better of the King’s for it, it being expressed for his great service to the King.

1667-03-01 20:10   I hear today that Tom Woodall, the known chyrurgeon, is killed at Somerset House by a Frenchman, but the occasion Sir W. Batten could not tell me.

1667-03-01 12:55 r But, blessed be, it was no such thing, but a countryman come about ordinary business to me.

1667-03-01 12:50   Just before dinner one of my people come up to me, and told me a man come from Huntingdon would speak with me, how my heart come into my mouth doubting that my father, who has been long sicke, was dead.

1667-03-01 12:15   Before dinner making my wife to sing. Poor wretch! her ear is so bad that it made me angry, till the poor wretch cried to see me so vexed at her, that I think I shall not discourage her so much again, but will endeavour to make her understand sounds, and do her good that way.

1667-03-01 11:15   Being returned home, I find Greeting, the flageolet-master, come, and teaching my wife; and I do think my wife will take pleasure in it, and it will be easy for her, and pleasant. So I, as I am well content with the charge it will occasion me.

1667-03-01 10:27   In Mark Lane, I do observe, it being St. David’s day, the picture of a man dressed like a Welchman, hanging by the neck upon one of the poles that stand out at the top of one of the merchants’ houses, in full proportion, and very handsomely done.

1667-03-01 09:32   Sent for to Sir G. Carteret to discourse of the business of the Navy, and our wants, and the best way of bestowing the little money we have, which is about 30,000l, but, God knows, we have need of ten times as much, which do make my life uncomfortable on the King’s behalf.

1667-03-01 07:48   Up, it being very cold weather again after a good deal of warm summer weather, and to the office, where I settled to do much business today.
