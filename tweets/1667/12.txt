1667-12-08 21:30   Captain Cocke tells me, to my great satisfaction, that Sir Robert Brookes did dine with him today; and that he told him, speaking of me, that he would make me the darling of the House of Commons, so much he is satisfied concerning me.

1667-12-08 19:08 r That we that have taken the most pains are called upon to answer for all crimes while those that, like Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes, did sit and do nothing, do lie still without any trouble; that the commanders, that undid all, are now the men that find fault and abuse others.

1667-12-08 19:04   Sir W. Coventry and I walking in the Matted Gallery. Our discourse was upon everything: the unhappiness of having our matters examined by people that understand them not; that it was better for us in the Navy to have men that do understand the whole, and that are not passionate.

1667-12-07 16:55 r She tells us that Catelin is likely to be soon acted, which I am glad to hear, but it is at the King’s House. But the King’s House is at present and hath for some days been silenced upon some difference between Hart and Moone.

1667-12-07 16:44 r She understanding all the things of note touching plays and fashions and Court and everything, and seems to love her niece very well, and was so glad (which was pretty odde) that since she came hither her breasts begin to swell, she being afeard before that she would have none.

1667-12-07 16:40   While we were at dinner comes Willet’s aunt to see her and my wife; she is a very fine widow and pretty handsome, but extraordinary well carriaged and speaks very handsomely and with extraordinary understanding, so as I spent the whole afternoon in her company with my wife.

1667-12-06 10:45 r He told me a story of my Lord Cottington who, wanting a son, intended to make his nephew his heir but did alter his mind upon the boy’s being persuaded by another young heir, in roguery, to crow like a cock at my Lord’s table. My Lord bade them take away that fool from the table.

1667-12-06 10:34   Sir J. Minnes told me a pretty story of Sir Lewes Dives, that having escaped once out of prison in woman’s apparel and leaping over a broad canal, a soldier put his hand towards her belly, and swore, "This is a strong Jade, but I never felt a cunt with a handle to it before."

1667-12-06 10:10   Home with Sir J. Minnes, who tells me that my Lord Chancellor did go away in a Custom-house boat, and is now at Callis: and, I confess, nothing seems to hang more heavy than his leaving of this unfortunate paper behind him, that hath angered both Houses.

1667-12-06 08:50   With Sir J. Minnes to the Duke of York, the first time that I have seen him, or we waited on him, since his sickness; and, blessed be God! he is not at all the worse for the smallpox, but is only a little weak yet.

1667-12-05 20:30   This day, not for want, but for good husbandry, I sent my father, by his desire, six pair of my old shoes, which fit him, and are good; yet, methought, it was a thing against my mind to have him wear my old things.

1667-12-04 21:58   So home, my wife to read to me in Sir R. Cotton’s book of warr, which is excellent reading, and particularly I was mightily pleased this night in what we read about the little profit or honour this kingdom ever gained by the greatest of its conquests abroad in France.

1667-12-04 15:10 r Upon the stairs there met her coming up again, and there kissed her twice, and her business was to enquire for Sir Edward Bishop, one of the sergeants at armes. I believe she was a woman of pleasure, but was shy enough to me, and so I saw her go out afterwards.

1667-12-04 15:01   Into the House, and there spied a pretty woman with spots on her face, well clad, who was enquiring for the guard chamber; I followed her, and there she went up, and turned into the turning towards the chapel, and I after her.

1667-12-04 14:10   I hear that the House of Lords did send down the paper which my Lord Chancellor left behind him, directed to the Lords, to be seditious and scandalous; and the Commons have voted that it be burned by the hands of the hangman, and that the King be desired to agree to it.

1667-12-03 21:20 r He tells me that the common standard now reckoned on between man and man, in places where there is no alteration of circumstances, but only the houses burnt, there the ground, which, with a house on it, did yield 100l. a-year, is now reputed worth 33l. 6s. 8d.

1667-12-03 21:04 r He tells me, also, speaking of the new street that is to be made from Guild Hall down to Cheapside, that the ground is already, most of it, bought.

1667-12-03 20:50   Sir Rd. Ford told us of the basenesse of the late Lord Mayor, Sir W. Bolton, in cheating the poor of the City out of the collections made for the people that were burned, of 1800l; of which he can give no account, which is the greatest piece of roguery ever found in a Lord Mayor.

1667-12-03 19:10 r To Sir W. Pen’s. Here I hear the whole that my Lord Chancellor is gone, and left a paper behind him for the House of Lords, telling them the reason of him retiring, complaining of a design for his ruin.

1667-12-03 18:03   At night home, and there met W. Batelier, who tells me the first great news that my Lord Chancellor is fled this day.

1667-12-02 22:20   This night our poor little dogg Fancy was in a strange fit, through age, of which she has had five or six.

1667-12-02 21:00   I bought some Scotch cakes at Wilkinson’s in King Street, and called my wife, and home, and there to supper, talk, and to bed. Supped upon these cakes, of which I have eat none since we lived at Westminster.

1667-12-02 14:43 r I shall take the boy to task about it, though I am contented to save my money if the boy knows not what is good for himself. So thanked him, and indeed he is a very honest man I believe.

1667-12-02 14:40   Mr. Caesar followed me and told me that my boy Tom hath this day declared to him that he cared not for the French lute and would learn no more, which Caesar out of faithfulness tells me that I might not spend any more money on him in vain.

1667-12-02 11:15   All the business is that the Lords’ answer is come down to the Commons, that they are not satisfied in the Commons’ Reasons: and so the Commons are hot, and like to sit all day upon the business what to do herein, most thinking that they will remonstrate against the Lords.

1667-12-02 09:50   To the Excise Office, where I find Mr. Ball out of humour in expectation of being put out of his office by the change of the farm of the excise.

1667-12-01 21:46   Comes Mr. Pelling and the two men that were with him formerly, the little man that sings so good a base (Wallington) and another that understands well, one Pigott, and Betty Turner, and we spent the evening mighty well in good music.

1667-12-01 17:40   Home, where W. Hewer dined with us, and after dinner he and I all the afternoon to read over our office letters to see what matters can be got for our advantage or disadvantage therein.

1667-12-01 09:15   I to church, where Mr. Mills, a dull sermon: and in our pew there sat a great lady, which I afterwards understood to be my Lady Carlisle, that made her husband a cuckold in Scotland, a very fine woman indeed in person.

1667-12-01 01:10   To bed, where frighted a good while and my wife again with noises, and my wife did rise twice, but I think it was Sir John Minnes’s people again late cleaning their house, for it was past 1 o’clock in the morning before we could fall to sleep.
