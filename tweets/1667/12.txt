1667-12-31 22:28 r And the King led into unsettled councils by some about him, and divisions growing between the King and Duke of York or else by foreign invasion, to which we must submit if any, at this bad point of time, should come upon us, which the King of France is well able to do.

1667-12-31 22:24 r Only with great trouble to my mind in reference to the public, there being little hopes left but that the whole nation must in a very little time be lost, either by troubles at home, the Parliament being dissatisfied.

1667-12-31 22:20   Thus ends the year, with great happiness to myself and family as to health and good condition in the world, blessed be God for it!

1667-12-31 16:24 r I did advise with him about my little vessel, “The Maybolt,” which he says will be best for me to sell, though my employing her to Newcastle this winter, and the next spring, for coles, will be a gainful trade, but yet make me great trouble, but I will think of it.

1667-12-31 16:10 r He says that it is known that there are Irish in the town, up and down, that do labour to entice the seamen out of the nation by giving them 3l. in hand, and promise of 40s. per month, to go into the King of France’s service, which is a mighty shame, but yet I believe is true.

1667-12-31 16:01   To the office, where Captain Perryman did give me an account how the seamen of England are discouraged by want of money (or otherwise by being, as he says, but I think without cause, by their being underrated) so far as that he thinks the greatest part are gone abroad or going.

1667-12-31 14:57   I to Westminster, and there to Mrs. Martin’s, and did hazer con ella what I desired, and there did drink with her, and find fault with her husband’s wearing of too fine clothes, by which I perceive he will be a beggar.

1667-12-31 09:10   I perceive all people’s expectation is, what will be the issue of this great business of putting these great Lords out of the council and power, the quarrel, I perceive, being only their standing against the will of the King in the business of the Chancellor.

1667-12-30 22:15   This day I got a little rent in my new fine camlett cloak with the latch of Sir G. Carteret’s door; but it is darned up at my tailor’s, that it will be no great blemish to it; but it troubled me.

1667-12-30 22:04 r At last it ended in few words and my silence (which for fear of growing higher between us I did forbear), and so to supper and to bed without one word one to another.

1667-12-30 21:15 r Home, where I told my wife where I had been. But she was as mad as a devil, and nothing but ill words between us all the evening, which I was troubled for, but do see that I must use policy to keep her spirit down, and to give her no offence by my being with Knepp and Pierce.

1667-12-30 18:59 r I am not delighted so much with it, as to admire it: for, not understanding the words, I lose the benefit of the vocalitys of the music, and it proves only instrumental; and therefore was more pleased to hear Knepp sing two or three little English things that I understood.

1667-12-30 18:56 r With Mrs. Knepp to Mrs. Manuel’s, where Mrs. Pierce was, and her boy and girl; and here I did hear Mrs. Manuel and one of the Italians, her gallant, sing well.

1667-12-30 17:03 r By coach home, and they were just gone away so, after a very little stay with my wife, I took coach again, and to the King’s playhouse again, and come in the fourth act; and it proves to me a very silly play, and to everybody else, as far as I could judge.

1667-12-30 14:46 r In the first act Orange Moll come to me, with one of our porters by my house, to tell me that Mrs. Pierce and Knepp did dine at my house today, and that I was desired to come home.

1667-12-30 14:12   With Sir Philip Carteret to the King’s playhouse, there to see “Love’s Cruelty.” When he come to the door, he had no money to pay for himself, and I perceive he is known there, and do run upon the score for plays, which is a shame; but I perceive always he is in want of money.

1667-12-30 13:20   I did understand from my Lady Jemimah that her brother Hinchingbroke’s business was to be ended this day, as she thinks, towards his match, and they do talk here of their intent to buy themselves some new clothes against the wedding, which I am very glad of.

1667-12-30 10:10 r They do now all they can to vilify the clergy, and do accuse Rochester (Dolben), of his being given to boys and of putting his hand into a gentleman his codpiece while they were at table together, and so do raise scandals.

1667-12-30 10:03   Sir G. Carteret and I did talk of the ruinous condition we are in, the King being going to put out of the Council so many able men; such as my Lord Anglesey, Ashly, Hollis, Secretary Morrice (to bring in Mr. Trevor), and the Archbishop of Canterbury, and my Lord Bridgewater.

1667-12-29 22:30   I to my very great content do find my accounts to come very even and naturally, and so to supper and to bed.

1667-12-29 20:00   Mr. William Pen, who is lately come over from Ireland, is a Quaker again, or some very melancholy thing; he cares for no company, nor comes into any which is a pleasant thing, after his being abroad so long, and his father such a hypocritical rogue, and at this time an Atheist.

1667-12-29 17:33 r Here I do see the folly of letting things go long unevened, it being very hard for me and dangerous to state after things are gone out of memory, and much more would be so should I have died in this time and my accounts come to other hands, to understand which would never be.

1667-12-29 17:22   At my chamber all the day, both morning and afternoon (only a little at dinner with my wife alone), upon the settling of my Tangier accounts towards the evening of all reckonings now against the new year.

1667-12-28 21:03   I am told today, which troubles me, that great complaint is made upon the ’Change, that the very Ostend little pickaroon men-of-war do offer violence to our merchant-men, and search them, beat our masters, and plunder them, upon pretence of carrying Frenchmen’s goods.

1667-12-28 17:45 r It pleased us mightily to see the natural affection of a poor woman, the mother of one of the children brought on the stage: the child crying, she by force got upon the stage, and took up her child and carried it away off of the stage from Hart.

1667-12-28 17:40   With my wife and girl to the King’s house, and there saw “The Mad Couple,” which is but an ordinary play; but only Nell’s and Hart’s mad parts are most excellently done, but especially hers: which makes it a miracle to me to think how ill she do any serious part.

1667-12-28 13:20   Up, and to the office, where busy all the morning, at noon home, and there to dinner with my clerks and Mr. Pelling, and had a very good dinner, among others a haunch of venison boiled, and merry we were.

1667-12-27 22:10   Home and to cards with my wife, W. Hewer, Mercer, and the girl, and mighty pleasant all the evening, and so to bed with my wife, which I have not done since her being ill for three weeks or thereabouts.

1667-12-27 13:15   I wrote a letter to the Duke of York from myself about my clerks extraordinary, which I have employed this war, to prevent my being obliged to answer for what others do without any reason demand allowance for, and so by this means I will be accountable for none but my own.

1667-12-27 11:58   Sir H. Cholmly tells me that the business of getting the Duchess of Richmond to Court is broke off, the Duke not suffering it; and thereby great trouble is brought among the people that endeavoured it, and thought they had compassed it.

1667-12-27 10:55 r Every body becoming an enemy to them in their retrenchments, and the King unstable, the debts great and the King’s present occasions for money great and many and pressing, the bankers broke and every body keeping in their money, while the times are doubtful what will stand.

1667-12-27 10:50   I and Sir W. Coventry walked an hour in the gallery, talking over many businesses, and he tells me that there are so many things concur to make him and his Fellow Commissioners unable to go through the King’s work that he do despair of it.

1667-12-27 09:30   The Duke of Albemarle takes the part of the Guards against us in our supplies of money, which is an odd consideration for a dull, heavy blockhead as he is, understanding no more of either than a goose.

1667-12-26 20:10   Mrs. Stewart do keep a court at Somerset House, with her husband the Duke of Richmond, she being visited for her beauty’s sake by people. They say that she is likely to go to Court again, and put my Lady Castlemayne’s nose out of joynt. God knows that would make a great turn.

1667-12-26 17:10   With my wife to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Surprizall;” which did not please me today, the actors not pleasing me; and especially Nell’s acting of a serious part, which she spoils.

1667-12-25 22:00 r Comes Mr. Pelling, and he sat and supped with us; and very good company, he reciting to us many copies of good verses of Dr. Wilde, who writ “Iter Boreale,” and so to bed, my boy being gone with W. Hewer and Mr. Hater to Mr. Gibson’s in the country to dinner.

1667-12-25 17:03 r Wife and girl and I alone at dinner — a good Christmas dinner, and all the afternoon at home, my wife reading to me “The History of the Drummer of Mr. Mompesson,” which is a strange story of spies, and worth reading indeed.

1667-12-25 10:30 r I slept well, and rose about nine, and to church, and there heard a dull sermon of Mr. Mills, but a great many fine people at church; and so home.

1667-12-25 04:15 r And so home round the city, and stopped and dropped money at five or six places, which I was the willinger to do, it being Christmas-day, and so home, and there find my wife in bed, and Jane and the maids making pyes, and so I to bed.

1667-12-25 03:25 r I stopped, having set them down and drank some burnt wine at the Rose Tavern door, while the constables come, and two or three Bellmen went by it being a fine, light, moonshine morning.

1667-12-25 02:47 r I left people receiving the Sacrament: and the Queen gone, and ladies; and so took my coach and away through Covent Garden, to set down two gentlemen and a lady, who come thither to see also, and did make mighty mirth in their talk of the folly of this religion.

1667-12-25 02:15 r But all things very rich and beautiful; and I see the papists have the wit, most of them, to bring cushions to kneel on, which I wanted, and was mightily troubled to kneel.

1667-12-25 02:10 r Their music very good, but their service I confess too frivolous, that there can be no zeal go along with it, and I do find by them themselves that they do run over their beads with one hand, and point and play and talk and make signs with the other in the midst of their masse.

1667-12-25 02:06 r I was afeard of my pocket being picked very much. But here I did make myself to do la cosa by mere imagination, mirando a jolie mosa and with my eyes open, which I never did before – and God forgive me for it, it being in the chapel.

1667-12-25 02:03 r The Queen was there, and some ladies. But, Lord! what an odde thing it was for me to be in a crowd of people, here a footman, there a beggar, here a fine lady, there a zealous poor papist, and here a Protestant, two or three together, come to see the show.

1667-12-25 02:00 r So to White Hall, and I through the Park to chapel, where I got in up almost to the rail, and with a great deal of patience staid from nine at night to two in the morning, in a great crowd; and there expected, but found nothing extraordinary there being nothing but a high masse.

1667-12-24 18:35   Busy at the office till six at night, and then by coach to St. James’s, this night being the eve of Christmas, at the Queen’s chapel. But it being not begun I to Westminster Hall, and there walked, and then to the Swan, and there drank and talked, and did besar a little Frank.

1667-12-23 21:03   My wife being pretty well all this day by reason of her imposthume being broke in her cheek into her mouth.

1667-12-23 12:50 r I bought a sermon of Dr. Floyd’s, which Creed read a great part of to me and Mr. Hollier, who dined with me, but as well writ and as good, against the Church of Rome, as ever I read; but, Lord! how Hollier, poor man, was taken with it.

1667-12-23 11:37 r I hear by Creed that the Bishops of Winchester and of Rochester, and the Dean of the Chapel, and some other great prelates, are suspended: and a cloud upon the Archbishop ever since the late business in the House of Lords; and I believe it will be a heavy blow to the Clergy.

1667-12-23 11:20 r Creed shewed me Mr. Coleman, of whom my wife hath so good an opinion, and says that he is as very a rogue for women as any in the world; which did disquiet me, like a fool, and run in my mind a great while.

1667-12-23 11:01   Creed and I to the Exchange, and there I saw Carr stand in the pillory for the business of my Lord Gerard, which is supposed will make a hot business in the House of Commons, when they shall come to sit again, the Lords having ordered this with great injustice.

1667-12-23 09:20   To the Commissioners of the Treasury. I had a dispute with Sir Stephen Fox about our orders for money, who is very angry, but I value it not. But, Lord! to see with what folly my Lord Albemarle do speak in this business would make a man wonder at the good fortune of such a fool.

1667-12-22 22:12   Up to my wife again, who is in great pain still with her tooth, and there, they gone, I spent the most of the afternoon and night reading and talking to bear her company, and so to supper and to bed.

1667-12-22 14:20   Cozen Kate Joyce come to see us and to tell me that her husband is going to build his house again, and would borrow of me 300l., which I shall upon good security be willing to do, and so told her, being willing to have some money out of my hands upon good security.

1667-12-22 12:58   I offering occasion to Mr. Holliard to discourse of the Church of Rome, Lord! how he run on to discourse with the greatest vehemence in the world, as the only thing in the world that he is full of, and it was good sport to me to see him so earnest on so little occasion.

1667-12-22 09:12   Up, and my wife, poor wretch, still in pain, and then to dress myself and down to my chamber, and thither come to me Willet with an errand from her mistress. This time I first did give her a little kiss, she being a very pretty humoured girl, and so one that I do love mightily.

1667-12-21 21:32   Home to sit with my wife, who is a little better, and her cheek asswaged. I read to her out of “The History of Algiers,” and did discourse about my sister Pall’s match, which is now on foot with one Jackson, another nephew of Mr. Phillips’s, to whom he hath left his estate.

1667-12-21 14:44   Creed tells me that the Nonconformists are mighty high, and their meetings frequented and connived at; and they do expect to have their day now soon; for my Lord of Buckingham is a declared friend to them, and even to the Quakers, who had very good words from the King himself.

1667-12-20 22:34   Home to my poor wife, who is in mighty pain, and her face miserably swelled: so as I was frighted to see it, and I was forced to lie below in the great chamber, where I have not lain many a day, and having sat up with her, talking and reading and pitying her, I to bed.

1667-12-20 20:47   The present sort of government is looked upon as a sort that we never had yet — a King and House of Commons against the House of Lords; though neither of the two first care a fig for one another, nor the third for them both, only the Bishops are afeard of losing ground.

1667-12-20 13:12   Home where my poor wife in bed in mighty pain, her left cheek so swelled as that we feared it would break, and so were fain to send for Mr. Hollier who seems doubtful of the defluxions of humours that may spoil her face, if not timely cured. He laid a poultice to it and so away.

1667-12-19 22:15   I away again home, and there to supper and to bed, my wife exceeding ill in her face with the tooth ake, and now her face has become mightily swelled that I am mightily troubled for it.

1667-12-19 20:12 r I hear how the House of Lords, with great severity if not tyranny, have ordered Carr, who only erred in the manner of the presenting his petition against my Lord Gerard: the poor man is ordered to stand in the pillory two or three times, and his eares cut, and be imprisoned.

1667-12-19 19:48   To Westminster, to the Hall, and do find that this evening the King by message (which he never did before) hath passed several bills, among others that for the Accounts, and for banishing my Lord Chancellor, and hath adjourned the House to February; at which I am glad.

1667-12-19 14:10   To the ’Change, where I stayed very little, and so home to dinner, and there find my wife mightily out of order with her teeth.

1667-12-19 12:55 r I did here look up and down this place, where I have not been before since the fire; and I see that the city are got a pace on in the rebuilding of Guildhall.

1667-12-19 12:32   To avoid being forced to invite him to dinner, it being his first day, and nobody inviting him, I did go to the ’Change with Sir W. Pen in his coach, who first went to Guildhall, whither I went with him, he to speak with Sheriff Gawden.

1667-12-19 09:20   To the Office, where Commissioner Middleton first took place at the Board as Surveyor of the Navy; and indeed I think will be an excellent officer; I am sure much beyond what his predecessor was.

1667-12-18 22:22   Home to my wife, who is troubled with the tooth ake, and there however I got her to read to me the History of Algiers, which I find a very pretty book, and so to supper with much pleasure talking, and to bed.

1667-12-18 10:20 r And this, which I do do, I hope to secure out of the plate, which was delivered into my custody of my Lord’s the other day by Mr. Cooke, and which I did get Mr. Stokes, the goldsmith, last night to weigh at my house, and there is enough to secure 100l.

1667-12-18 10:13   To my goldsmith’s, to look after the providing of 60l. for Mr. Moore, towards the answering of my Lord Sandwich’s bill of exchange, he being come to be contented with my lending him 60l. in part of it, which pleases me, I expecting to have been forced to answer the whole bill.

1667-12-17 20:20   This day I do hear at White Hall that the Duke of Monmouth is sick, and in danger of the smallpox.

1667-12-16 11:10   To Westminster, where I find the House mighty busy upon a petition against my Lord Gerard, which lays heavy things to his charge, of his abusing the King in his Guards; and very hot the House is upon it.

1667-12-16 09:00   Up, and to several places, to pay what I owed. Among others, to my mercer, to pay for my fine camlott cloak, which costs me, the very stuff, almost 6l.; and also a velvet coat — the outside cost me above 8l.

1667-12-15 20:57 r Most of our talk was of the great discourse the world hath against my Lady Batten, for getting her husband to give her all, and disinherit his eldest son; though the truth is, the son, as they say, did play the knave with his father when time was.

1667-12-15 20:27   Comes Mrs. Turner to visit us, and she sat and supped with us, and her son Francke being there, now upon the point of his going to the East Indys, I did give him “Lex Mercatoria,” and my wife my old pair of tweezers, which are pretty, and my book an excellent one for him.

1667-12-15 16:58   I busy at my chamber all the afternoon, and looking over my plate, which indeed is a very fine quantity, God knows, more than ever I expected to see of my own, and more than is fit for a man of no better quality than I am.

1667-12-15 09:02   Up, and to church, where I heard a German preach, in a tone hard to be understood, but yet an extraordinary good sermon, and wholly to my great content.

1667-12-14 17:03   To the office again till night, when Mr. Moore come to me to discourse about the 200l. I must supply my Lord Hinchingbroke, and I promised him to do it, though much against my will.

1667-12-13 22:10   To supper and to bed, troubled with my parting with the 200l., which I must lend my Lord Sandwich to answer his bill of exchange.

1667-12-13 19:20   Sir W. Warren and I walked upon Tower Hill by moonlight a great while, consulting business of the office and our present condition, which is but bad, it being most likely that the Parliament will change all hands, and so let them, so I may keep but what I have.

1667-12-13 16:40   To Sir William Turner, about the business of my bargain with my Lady Batten; and he do give me good advice, and that I am safe, but that there is a great many pretty considerations in it that makes it necessary for me to be silent for a while till we see whether the ship be safe.

1667-12-13 15:05   Comes Mr. Moore, and he and I alone a while, he telling me my Lord Sandwich’s credit is like to be undone, if the bill of 200l. my Lord Hinchingbroke wrote to me about be not paid tomorrow, and that, if I do not help him about it, they have no way but to let it be protested.

1667-12-13 12:58   Among other pieces of news, it is now fresh that the King of Portugall is deposed, and his brother made King; and that my Lord Sandwich is gone from Madrid with great honour to Lisbon, to make up a peace to the advantage, as the Spaniard would have it, of Spain.

1667-12-13 09:50   I hear that the Lords’ Bill for banishing and disabling my Lord Chancellor from bearing any office, or being in the King’s dominions, and its being made felony for any to correspond with him but his own children, is brought to the Commons: but they will not agree to it.

1667-12-13 08:00   To the office, being in some doubt of having my cozen Roger and Lord Hinchinbroke and Sir Thos. Crew by my cozens invitation at dinner today, and we wholly unprovided.

1667-12-12 17:20 r Here only I saw a French lady in the pit, with a tunique, just like one of ours, only a handkercher about her neck; but this fashion for a woman did not look decent.

1667-12-12 17:14   I all alone to the Duke of York’s house, and saw “The Tempest,” which, as often as I have seen it, I do like very well, and the house very full. But I could take little pleasure more than the play, for not being able to look about, for fear of being seen.

1667-12-12 09:10   Sir Stephen Fox and I to Sir Robert Longs to discourse the business of our orders for money, he for the guards, and I for Tangier, and were a little angry in our concerns, one against the other, but yet parted good friends, and I think I got ground by it.

1667-12-11 18:47   Comes Sir W. Warren. We fell to discourse of my little vessel, “The Maybolt,” and he thinks that it will be best for me to employ her for a voyage to Newcastle for coles, they being now dear, and the voyage not long, nor dangerous yet; and I think I shall go near to do so.

1667-12-11 11:14 r And Burt acts Cicero, which they all conclude he will not be able to do well. The King gives them 500l. for robes, there being, as they say, to be sixteen scarlett robes.

1667-12-11 11:10   I met Rolt and Sir John Chichly, and Harris, the player, and there we talked of many things, and particularly of “Catiline,” which is to be suddenly acted at the King’s house; and there all agree that it cannot be well done at that house, there not being good actors enow.

1667-12-10 19:58 r Here met Mr. Hinxton, the organist, walking, and I walked with him; and, asking him many questions, I do find that he can no more give an intelligible answer to a man that is not a great master in his art, than another man.

1667-12-10 19:25   To Westminster Hall, and there hear that the King did send a message to the House today that he would adjourne them on the 17th instant to February; by which time, at least, I shall have more respite to prepare things on my own behalf, and the Office, against their return.

1667-12-10 17:20   To my office again, where did much business till night, that my eyes begun to be sore, and then forced to leave off.

1667-12-09 19:49   I did draw up my answer to Sir Rob. Brookes’s letter, and went down to my clerks at the office for their opinion which at this time serves me to very good purpose, they having many things in their heads which I had not in the businesses of the office now in dispute.

1667-12-09 12:20   I was troubled with my Lord Hinchingbroke’s sending to borrow 200l. of me; but I did answer that I had none, nor could borrow any; for I am resolved I will not be undone for any body, though I would do much for my Lord Sandwich — for it is to answer a bill of exchange of his.

1667-12-09 10:47   Sir G. Carteret tells me that the King himself did the other day very particularly tell the whole story of my Lord Sandwich’s not following the Dutch ships, with which he is charged; and shews the reasons of it to be the only good course he could have taken.

1667-12-08 21:30   Captain Cocke tells me, to my great satisfaction, that Sir Robert Brookes did dine with him today; and that he told him, speaking of me, that he would make me the darling of the House of Commons, so much he is satisfied concerning me.

1667-12-08 19:08 r That we that have taken the most pains are called upon to answer for all crimes while those that, like Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes, did sit and do nothing, do lie still without any trouble; that the commanders, that undid all, are now the men that find fault and abuse others.

1667-12-08 19:04   Sir W. Coventry and I walking in the Matted Gallery. Our discourse was upon everything: the unhappiness of having our matters examined by people that understand them not; that it was better for us in the Navy to have men that do understand the whole, and that are not passionate.

1667-12-07 16:55 r She tells us that Catelin is likely to be soon acted, which I am glad to hear, but it is at the King’s House. But the King’s House is at present and hath for some days been silenced upon some difference between Hart and Moone.

1667-12-07 16:44 r She understanding all the things of note touching plays and fashions and Court and everything, and seems to love her niece very well, and was so glad (which was pretty odde) that since she came hither her breasts begin to swell, she being afeard before that she would have none.

1667-12-07 16:40   While we were at dinner comes Willet’s aunt to see her and my wife; she is a very fine widow and pretty handsome, but extraordinary well carriaged and speaks very handsomely and with extraordinary understanding, so as I spent the whole afternoon in her company with my wife.

1667-12-06 10:45 r He told me a story of my Lord Cottington who, wanting a son, intended to make his nephew his heir but did alter his mind upon the boy’s being persuaded by another young heir, in roguery, to crow like a cock at my Lord’s table. My Lord bade them take away that fool from the table.

1667-12-06 10:34   Sir J. Minnes told me a pretty story of Sir Lewes Dives, that having escaped once out of prison in woman’s apparel and leaping over a broad canal, a soldier put his hand towards her belly, and swore, "This is a strong Jade, but I never felt a cunt with a handle to it before."

1667-12-06 10:10   Home with Sir J. Minnes, who tells me that my Lord Chancellor did go away in a Custom-house boat, and is now at Callis: and, I confess, nothing seems to hang more heavy than his leaving of this unfortunate paper behind him, that hath angered both Houses.

1667-12-06 08:50   With Sir J. Minnes to the Duke of York, the first time that I have seen him, or we waited on him, since his sickness; and, blessed be God! he is not at all the worse for the smallpox, but is only a little weak yet.

1667-12-05 20:30   This day, not for want, but for good husbandry, I sent my father, by his desire, six pair of my old shoes, which fit him, and are good; yet, methought, it was a thing against my mind to have him wear my old things.

1667-12-04 21:58   So home, my wife to read to me in Sir R. Cotton’s book of warr, which is excellent reading, and particularly I was mightily pleased this night in what we read about the little profit or honour this kingdom ever gained by the greatest of its conquests abroad in France.

1667-12-04 15:10 r Upon the stairs there met her coming up again, and there kissed her twice, and her business was to enquire for Sir Edward Bishop, one of the sergeants at armes. I believe she was a woman of pleasure, but was shy enough to me, and so I saw her go out afterwards.

1667-12-04 15:01   Into the House, and there spied a pretty woman with spots on her face, well clad, who was enquiring for the guard chamber; I followed her, and there she went up, and turned into the turning towards the chapel, and I after her.

1667-12-04 14:10   I hear that the House of Lords did send down the paper which my Lord Chancellor left behind him, directed to the Lords, to be seditious and scandalous; and the Commons have voted that it be burned by the hands of the hangman, and that the King be desired to agree to it.

1667-12-03 21:20 r He tells me that the common standard now reckoned on between man and man, in places where there is no alteration of circumstances, but only the houses burnt, there the ground, which, with a house on it, did yield 100l. a-year, is now reputed worth 33l. 6s. 8d.

1667-12-03 21:04 r He tells me, also, speaking of the new street that is to be made from Guild Hall down to Cheapside, that the ground is already, most of it, bought.

1667-12-03 20:50   Sir Rd. Ford told us of the basenesse of the late Lord Mayor, Sir W. Bolton, in cheating the poor of the City out of the collections made for the people that were burned, of 1800l; of which he can give no account, which is the greatest piece of roguery ever found in a Lord Mayor.

1667-12-03 19:10 r To Sir W. Pen’s. Here I hear the whole that my Lord Chancellor is gone, and left a paper behind him for the House of Lords, telling them the reason of him retiring, complaining of a design for his ruin.

1667-12-03 18:03   At night home, and there met W. Batelier, who tells me the first great news that my Lord Chancellor is fled this day.

1667-12-02 22:20   This night our poor little dogg Fancy was in a strange fit, through age, of which she has had five or six.

1667-12-02 21:00   I bought some Scotch cakes at Wilkinson’s in King Street, and called my wife, and home, and there to supper, talk, and to bed. Supped upon these cakes, of which I have eat none since we lived at Westminster.

1667-12-02 14:43 r I shall take the boy to task about it, though I am contented to save my money if the boy knows not what is good for himself. So thanked him, and indeed he is a very honest man I believe.

1667-12-02 14:40   Mr. Caesar followed me and told me that my boy Tom hath this day declared to him that he cared not for the French lute and would learn no more, which Caesar out of faithfulness tells me that I might not spend any more money on him in vain.

1667-12-02 11:15   All the business is that the Lords’ answer is come down to the Commons, that they are not satisfied in the Commons’ Reasons: and so the Commons are hot, and like to sit all day upon the business what to do herein, most thinking that they will remonstrate against the Lords.

1667-12-02 09:50   To the Excise Office, where I find Mr. Ball out of humour in expectation of being put out of his office by the change of the farm of the excise.

1667-12-01 21:46   Comes Mr. Pelling and the two men that were with him formerly, the little man that sings so good a base (Wallington) and another that understands well, one Pigott, and Betty Turner, and we spent the evening mighty well in good music.

1667-12-01 17:40   Home, where W. Hewer dined with us, and after dinner he and I all the afternoon to read over our office letters to see what matters can be got for our advantage or disadvantage therein.

1667-12-01 09:15   I to church, where Mr. Mills, a dull sermon: and in our pew there sat a great lady, which I afterwards understood to be my Lady Carlisle, that made her husband a cuckold in Scotland, a very fine woman indeed in person.

1667-12-01 01:10   To bed, where frighted a good while and my wife again with noises, and my wife did rise twice, but I think it was Sir John Minnes’s people again late cleaning their house, for it was past 1 o’clock in the morning before we could fall to sleep.
