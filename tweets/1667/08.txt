1667-08-08 16:42   I met Mr. Evelyn, and talked of several things, but particularly of the times: he tells me that wise men do prepare to remove abroad what they have, for that we must be ruined, our case being past relief, the kingdom so much in debt, and the King minding nothing but his lust.

1667-08-08 12:32   Creed tells me that Sir Henry Bellasses is dead of the duell he fought about ten days ago, with Tom Porter; and it is pretty to see how the world talk of them as a couple of fools, that killed one another out of love.

1667-08-07 17:30   My wife abroad with her maid Jane and Tom all the afternoon, being gone forth to eat some pasties at “The Bottle of Hay,” in St. John’s Street, as you go to Islington, of which she is mighty fond.

1667-08-07 15:13 r And Mr. Pierce says my Lady Castlemayne made the King ask her forgiveness upon his knees, and promised to offend her no more so that, indeed, she did threaten to bring all his bastards to his closet-door, and hath nearly hectored him out of his wits.

1667-08-07 15:10   Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, tells me that though the King and my Lady Castlemayne are friends again, she is not at White Hall, but at Sir D. Harvy’s, whither the King goes to her.

1667-08-06 22:32   My wife, as she said last night, hath put away Nell today, for her gossiping abroad and telling of stories.

1667-08-06 22:20 r Sir W. Batten did tell me tonight that the Council have ordered a hearing before them of Carcasses business, which do vex me mightily, that we should be troubled so much by an idle rogue, a servant of our own, and all my thoughts tonight have been how to manage the matter.

1667-08-06 22:15   Into the garden with my wife, and to Sir W. Batten’s with W. Pen and J. Minnes, and there eat a melon and talked, and so home to supper and to bed.

1667-08-06 14:02   I to the Office, only met at the door with Mrs. Martin and Mrs. Burroughs, who I took in and drank with, but was afraid my wife should see them, they being, especially the first, a prattling gossip, and so after drinking with them parted, and I to the Office.

1667-08-06 13:10   Home to dinner, where I find Mrs. Wood, formerly Bab. Shelden, and our Mercer, who is dressed today in a paysan dress, that looks mighty pretty. We dined and sang and laughed mighty merry.

1667-08-06 10:40   My Lord Anglesey did tell us that the Dutch do make a further bogle with us about two or three things, which they will be satisfied in, he says, by us easily.

1667-08-05 20:47   My wife mighty angry with Nell, who is turned a very gossip, and gads abroad as soon as our backs are turned, and will put her away tomorrow, which I am not sorry for.

1667-08-05 17:28   Sir W. Pen and my wife and I to the Duke of York’s house, and there saw “Love Trickes, or the School of Compliments;” a silly play, only Mis’s dancing in a shepherd’s clothes did please us mightily.

1667-08-05 11:50   To the Exchange, where I hear the ill news of our loss lately of four rich ships, two from Guinea, one from Gallipoly, all with rich oyles; and the other from Barbadoes, worth, as is guessed, 80,000l.

1667-08-05 10:28   I spied Signor Francisco tuning his gittar, and Monsieur de Puy with him, who did make him play to me, which he did most admirably — so well as I was mightily troubled that all that pains should have been taken upon so bad an instrument.

1667-08-04 22:47   Busy at my office from morning till night, in writing with my own hand fair our large general account of the expence and debt of the Navy, which lasted me till night to do, that I was almost blind.

1667-08-03 23:14   Hard to work till very late and my eyes began to fail me, which now upon very little overworking them they do, which grieves me much.

1667-08-03 15:38   To the office again, there to enable myself, by finishing our great account, to give it to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury; which I did, and there was called in to them, to tell them only the total of our debt of the Navy on the 25th of May last, which is above 950,000l.

1667-08-02 23:58   Home to supper and to bed, my wife being gone in an ill humour to bed before me.

1667-08-02 21:48   To the office, where and with my Lord Bruncker at his lodgings all the afternoon and evening making up our great account for the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, but not so as pleased me yet.

1667-08-02 12:10 r I do think by something too my wife said to-day, that she took notice that I had not lain with her this half-year, that she thinks that I have some doubt that she might be with child by somebody else.

1667-08-02 12:03   My wife comes to me alone, and tells me she had those upon her and bid me remember it. I asked her why, and she said she had a reason.

1667-08-02 07:05 r So my wife up and come to me and added more, and spoke basely of my father, who I perceive did do something in the country, at her last being there, that did not like her, but I would not enquire into anything, but let her talk.

1667-08-02 06:50   Before I rose my wife fell into angry discourse of my kindness yesterday to Mrs. Knipp, and leading her, and sitting in the coach hand in hand, and my arm about her middle, and in some bad words reproached me with it.

1667-08-01 22:10 r We home, and at Newgate we find them in trouble, some thieves having this night broke open prison. And our coachman was fain to drive hard from two or three fellows, which he said were rogues, that he met at the end of Blow-bladder Street, next Cheapside.

1667-08-01 19:50 r After the play, we into the house, and spoke with Knipp, who went abroad with us by coach to the Neat Houses in the way to Chelsy; and there, in a box in a tree, we sat and sang, and talked and eat; my wife out of humour, as she always is, when this woman is by.

1667-08-01 17:04 r To the King’s house, to see “The Custome of the Country.” The house mighty empty — more than ever I saw it — and an ill play.

1667-08-01 13:35 r Mrs. Markham was here, with her great belly. I was very merry, and after dinner, upon a motion of the women, I was got to go to the play with them — the first I have seen since before the Dutch coming upon our coast.

1667-08-01 13:20   My wife and I dined at Sir W. Pen’s, only with Mrs. Turner and her husband, on a damned venison pasty, that stunk like a devil. However, I did not know it till dinner was done.
