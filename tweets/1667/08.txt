1667-08-31 21:48   This day, being dissatisfied with my wife’s learning so few songs of Goodgroome, I did come to a new bargain with him to teach her songs at so much, viz; 10s. a song, which he accepts of, and will teach her.

1667-08-31 19:42   I to White Hall to see how matters go, and there I met with Mr. Ball, and he tells me that the Seal is delivered to Sir Orlando Bridgeman; the man of the whole nation that is the best spoken of, and will please most people; and therefore I am mighty glad of it.

1667-08-31 09:52   By Sir W. Pen, I do hear that the Seal was fetched away to the King yesterday from the Lord Chancellor by Secretary Morrice; which puts me into a great horror, to have it done after so much debate and confidence that it would not be done at last.

1667-08-30 19:15 r I confess I did wonder at her courage to come abroad, thinking the people would abuse her; but they, silly people! do not know her work she makes, and therefore suffered her with great respect to take coach, and she away, without any trouble at all, which I wondered at.

1667-08-30 19:04   I to Bartholomew fair, to walk up and down; and there, among other things, find my Lady Castlemayne at a puppet-play, “Patient Grizill,” and the street full of people expecting her coming out.

1667-08-30 14:20 r After dinner into the garden and wilderness, which is like the rest of the house, nothing in order, nor looked after.

1667-08-30 13:42 r I was sick to see it, but was merry at some ridiculous humours of my Lady Batten, who, as being an ill-bred woman, would take exceptions at anything any body said, and I made good sport at it.

1667-08-30 13:40   I took coach and with my wife to Walthamstow; to Sir W. Pen’s, by invitation, the first time I have been there, and there find him and all their guests at dinner, which was a very bad dinner. I never knew people in my life that make their flutter, that do things so meanly.

1667-08-30 10:16 r They are able and most ready to discharge the debt of theirs, but we are neither able nor willing to do that for ours, the debt of those in Zealand only, amounting to above 5000l. for men taken in the King’s own ships, besides others taken in merchantmen.

1667-08-30 10:14   It seems the Dutch have got us to agree in the treaty, as they fool us in anything, that the dyet of the prisoners on both sides shall be paid for, before they be released; which they have done, knowing ours to run high, they having more prisoners of ours than we have of theirs.

1667-08-30 09:10   Captain Cocke tells me that there is yet expectation that the Chancellor will lose the Seal, and that he is sure that the King hath said it to him who told it him, and he fears we shall be soon broke in pieces.

1667-08-29 16:00   I find at Sir G. Carteret’s that they do mightily joy themselves in the hopes of my Lord Chancellor’s getting over this trouble; and I make them believe, and so, indeed, I do believe he will, that my Lord Chancellor is become popular by it.

1667-08-28 19:10   My wife and I took coach and went twice round Bartholomew fayre; which I was glad to see again, after two years missing it by the plague.

1667-08-28 15:32   With my Lady Batten, Pen, and her daughter, and my wife, to Mrs. Poole’s, where I mighty merry among the women, and christened the child, a girl, Elizabeth, which, though a girl, yet my Lady Batten would have me to give the name.

1667-08-28 10:15   To White Hall, to attend the Council, by their order, with an answer to their demands touching our advice for the paying off of the seamen, when the ships shall come in, which answer is worth seeing, showing the badness of our condition.

1667-08-27 18:03 r And she stood joying herself at the old man’s going away; and several of the gallants of White Hall, of which there were many staying to see the Chancellor return, did talk to her in her birdcage; among others, Blancford, telling her she was the bird of paradise.

1667-08-27 18:00   Mr. Pierce tells me how this business of my Lord Chancellor’s was designed in my Lady Castlemayne’s chamber; and that, when he went from the King on Monday morning, she was in bed, and ran out in her smock into her aviary looking into White Hall garden.

1667-08-27 16:15 r Here Sir J. Minnes and I looking upon the pictures; and Mr. Chevins, being by, did take us, of his own accord, into the King’s closet, to shew us some pictures, which, indeed, is a very noble place, and exceeding great variety of brave pictures, and the best hands.

1667-08-27 15:33   I to White Hall, and there hear how it is like to go well enough with my Lord Chancellor; that he is like to keep his Seal, desiring that he may stand his trial in Parliament, if they will accuse him of any thing.

1667-08-27 07:04   Up, and am invited betimes to be godfather tomorrow to Captain Poole’s child with my Lady Pen and Lady Batten, which I accepted out of complaisance to them.

1667-08-26 17:14   I walked to the King’s playhouse, there to meet Sir W. Pen, and saw “The Surprizall,” a very mean play, I thought: or else it was because I was out of humour, and but very little company in the house.

1667-08-26 14:32 r Sir J. Minnes and I to White Hall, where we could be informed in no more than we were told before, nobody knowing the result of the meeting, but that the matter is suspended.

1667-08-26 13:39 r It is said also that my Lord Chancellor answers, that he desires he may be brought to his trial, if he have done any thing to lose his office; and that he will be willing, and is most desirous, to lose that, and his head both together.

1667-08-26 13:30 r I dined at Sir W. Batten’s, where Mr. Boreman was, who come from White Hall; who tells us that he saw my Lord Chancellor come with some of his men, without his Seal, to White Hall to his chamber; and thither the King and Duke of York come and staid together, an hour or more.

1667-08-26 10:15 r The King did yesterday send the Duke of Albemarle, the only man fit for those works, to him for his purse: to which the Chancellor answered, that he received it from the King, and would deliver it to the King’s own hand, and so civilly returned the Duke of Albemarle without it.

1667-08-26 10:03   To the Office, and my Lord Anglesey with us, who, and my Lord Bruncker, do bring us news how my Lord Chancellor’s seal is to be taken away from him today. The thing is so great and sudden to me, that it put me into a very great admiration what should be the meaning of it.

1667-08-26 08:40   Up, and Greeting come, and I reckoned with him for his teaching of my wife and me upon the flageolet to this day, and so paid him for having as much as he can teach us.

1667-08-25 17:17   I up to Putney, and there stepped into the church, to look upon the fine people there, whereof there is great store, and the young ladies; and so walked to Barne-Elmes, whither I sent Russel, reading of Boyle’s Hydrostatickes, which are of infinite delight.

1667-08-25 15:09   To Westminster, and to the parish church, thinking to see Betty Michell; and did stay an hour in the crowd, thinking, by the end of a nose that I saw, that it had been her; but at last the head turned towards me, and it was her mother, which vexed me.

1667-08-24 22:15   This morning was proclaimed the peace between us and the States of the United Provinces, and also of the King of France and Denmarke; and in the afternoon the Proclamations were printed and come out; and at night the bells rung, but no bonfires that I hear of any where.

1667-08-24 20:40   So with my wife to Mile End, and there drank of Bides ale, and so home. Most of our discourse is about our keeping a coach the next year, which pleases my wife mightily; and if I continue as able as now, it will save us money.

1667-08-24 17:33 r My belly now full with plays, that I do intend to bind myself to see no more till Michaelmas.

1667-08-24 17:17 r But it is pretty to observe how I look up and down for, and did spy Knipp; but durst not own it to my wife that I see her, for fear of angering her, who do not like my kindness to her, and so I was forced not to take notice of her.

1667-08-24 17:15   Dined, and Creed with me, at home. After dinner we to a play, and there saw “The Cardinall” at the King’s house, wherewith I am mightily pleased; but, above all, with Becke Marshall.

1667-08-23 20:33   Called my wife, and to the King’s house, and saw “The Mayden Queene,” which pleases us mightily; and then away, and took up Mrs. Turner at her door, and so to Mile End, and there drank, and so back to her house, it being a fine evening, and there supped.

1667-08-23 14:22 r Their business with me was to consider how to assigne such of our commanders as will take assignements upon the Act for their wages; and the consideration thereof was referred to me to give them an answer the next sitting: which is a horrid poor thing.

1667-08-23 14:07   I to the Treasury-chamber, where I waited, talking with Sir G. Downing, till the Lords met. By and by the Lords come; and I perceive Sir W. Coventry is the man, and nothing done till he comes.

1667-08-23 10:04   To White Hall in a hackney-coach with Sir W Pen, and in our way, in the narrow street near Paul’s, going the backway by Tower Street, and the coach being forced to put back, he was turning himself into a cellar, which made people cry out to us, and so we were forced to leap out.

1667-08-23 09:04   Greeting comes, who brings me a tune for two flageolets, which we played, and is a tune played at the King’s playhouse which goes so well that I will have more of them, and it will be a mighty pleasure for me to have my wife able to play a part with me, which she will easily do.

1667-08-22 22:04   My wife very fine today, in her new suit of laced cuffs and perquisites.

1667-08-22 20:45   Pelling comes to me, and tells me that the Dutch letters are come, and that the peace was proclaimed there the 19th inst., and that all is finished; which I know not whether to be glad or sorry for, a peace being so necessary, and yet the peace is so bad in its terms.

1667-08-22 17:30 r The rest of the play, though pretty good, was not well acted by most of them, methought; so that I took no great content in it.

1667-08-22 17:27   With my Lord Bruncker and his mistress to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Indian Emperour,” where I find Nell come again; but was most infinitely displeased with her being put to act the Emperour’s daughter; which is a great and serious part, which she do most basely.

1667-08-22 09:30 r Two men leapt overboard, among others, into the Thames, out of the vessel into which they were pressed, and were shot by the soldiers placed there to keep them, two days since; so much people do avoid the King’s service!

1667-08-22 09:26   We do plainly see that the desperate condition that we put men into for want of their pay, makes them mad, they being as good men as ever were in the world, and would as readily serve the King again, were they but paid.

1667-08-21 17:20 r Here sat and talked, and it is a strange thing to see the impudence of the woman, that desires by all means to have her marido come home, only that she might be at liberty to have me para tocar her, which is a thing I do not so much desire.

1667-08-21 16:57   To Westminster Hall and there staid a while, and thence to Mrs. Martin’s, and there did take a little pleasure both with her and her sister.

1667-08-21 09:50   Come two of Captain Cooke’s boys, whose voices are broke, but have extraordinary skill; and they and my boy, with his broken voice, did sing; but to hear them sing with their broken voices, which they could not command to keep in tune, would make a man mad — so bad it was.

1667-08-21 07:20 r However, by-and-by a way was found that she had them, and I well satisfied, being unwilling to let our difference grow higher upon so small an occasion and frowardness of mine.

1667-08-21 07:10 r Up, and my wife and I fell out about the pair of cuffs, which she hath a mind to have to go to see the ladies dancing tomorrow at Betty Turner’s school; and do vex me so that I am resolved to deny them her.

1667-08-20 21:58   To the office, where my eyes would not suffer me to do any thing by candlelight, and so called my wife and walked in the garden. She mighty pressing for a new pair of cuffs, which I am against the laying out of money upon yet, which makes her angry.

1667-08-20 17:30   With my Lord Bruncker to the Duke’s Playhouse, and there saw “Sir Martin Marr-all” again, which I have now seen three times, and it hath been acted but four times, and still find it a very ingenious play, and full of variety.

1667-08-20 14:03   Sir W. Batten told me that he heard how Carcasse do now give out that he will hang me, among the rest of his threats of him and Pen, which is the first word I ever heard of the kind from him concerning me.

1667-08-19 22:20   I home to supper and to read a little (which I cannot refrain, though I have all the reason in the world to favour my eyes, which every day grow worse and worse by over-using them), and then to bed.

1667-08-19 21:15 r He says every body do think that there is something extraordinary that keeps us so long from the news of the peace being ratified, which the King and the Duke of York have expected these six days.

1667-08-19 21:10   Mr. Moore do agree with most people that I meet with, that we shall fall into a commonwealth in a few years; for the charge of a monarchy is such as the kingdom cannot be brought to bear willingly, nor are things managed so well nowadays under it, as heretofore.

1667-08-19 17:25   Out and took coach and to the Duke of York’s house, all alone, and there saw “Sir Martin Marr-all” again, though I saw him but two days since, and do find it the most comical play that ever I saw in my life.

1667-08-18 19:55 r Then the coachman blew some tobacco in his nose, upon which the horse sneezed, and, by and by, grows well, and draws us the rest of our way, as well as ever he did; which was one of the strangest things of a horse I ever observed, but he says it is usual. It is the staggers.

1667-08-18 19:52 r One of our coach-horses fell sick of the staggers, so as he was ready to fall down. The coachman was fain to ’light, and hold him up, and cut his tongue to make him bleed, and his tail.

1667-08-18 19:48   Home, and there took up my wife, and to Islington with her, our old road, but before we got to Islington, between that and Kingsland, there happened an odd adventure:

1667-08-18 15:57 r And then I fell to gaze upon another pretty maid in a pew close to me, and she on me; and I did go about to take her by the hand, which she suffered a little and then withdrew. So the sermon ended, and the church broke up, and my amours ended also.

1667-08-18 15:48 r But she would not, but got further and further from me; and, at last, I could perceive her to take pins out of her pocket to prick me if I should touch her again — which seeing I did forbear, and was glad I did spy her design.

1667-08-18 15:45   I walked towards White Hall, but, being wearied, turned into St. Dunstan’s Church, where I heard an able sermon of the minister of the place; and stood by a pretty, modest maid, whom I did labour to take by the hand and the body.

1667-08-18 13:10   To our church, where a dull sermon and our church empty of the best sort of people, they being at their country houses. Home, and there dined with me Mr. Turner and his daughter Betty, who is grown a fine lady as to carriage and discourse. I and my wife are pleased with her.

1667-08-17 20:55 r Home and went as far as Mile End with Sir W. Pen, whose coach took him up there for his country-house; and after having drunk there, at the Rose and Crowne, a good house for Alderman Bides ale, we parted, and we home.

1667-08-17 17:18 r Only I was pleased to see Knipp dance among the milkmaids, and to hear her sing a song to Queen Elizabeth; and to see her come out in her night-gowne with no locks on, but her bare face and hair only tied up in a knot behind; which is the comeliest dress that ever I saw her in.

1667-08-17 17:15 r I confess I have sucked in so much of the sad story of Queen Elizabeth, from my cradle, that I was ready to weep for her; but the play is the most ridiculous that sure ever come upon the stage. The play is merely a puppet play, acted by living puppets.

1667-08-17 14:21   My wife and I and Sir W. Pen to the King’s playhouse, where the house extraordinary full; and there was the King and Duke of York to see the new play, “Queen Elizabeth’s Troubles and the History of Eighty Eight.”

1667-08-17 10:56   Carcasse hath a hearing this morning before the Council and hath summonsed at least thirty persons, and which is wondrous, a great many of them, I hear, do declare more against him than for him, and yet he summonses people without distinction.

1667-08-16 21:47   Every body wonders that we have no news from Bredah of the ratification of the peace; and do suspect that there is some stop in it. So to bed.

1667-08-16 20:33   To supper in pain by the sudden change of the weather cold and my drinking of cold drink, which I must begin to leave off, though I shall try it as long as I can without much pain. But I find myself to be full of wind, and my anus to be knit together as it is always with cold.

1667-08-16 19:42   Home, and I to the office a little, and so to my chamber, and read the history of 88 in Speede, in order to my seeing the play thereof acted to-morrow at the King’s house.

1667-08-16 18:10   To the New Exchange with my wife, where, at my bookseller’s, I saw “The History of the Royall Society,” which, I believe, is a fine book, and have bespoke one in quires.

1667-08-16 17:24 r It is the most entire piece of mirth, a complete farce from one end to the other, that certainly was ever writ. I never laughed so in all my life. I laughed till my head ached with the laughing; and at very good wit therein, not fooling.

1667-08-16 17:20   My wife and I to the Duke’s playhouse, where we saw the new play acted yesterday, “The Feign Innocence, or Sir Martin Marr-all;” a play made by my Lord Duke of Newcastle, but, as every body says, corrected by Dryden.

1667-08-15 17:35   Sir W. Pen and I to the Duke’s house, where a new play. The King and Court there, the house full, and an act begun. And so went to the King’s, and there saw “The Merry Wives of Windsor,” which did not please me at all, in no part of it.

1667-08-15 10:15   To the office, and to our discourse about Carcasse, and how much we are troubled that we should be brought, as they say we shall, to defend our report before the Council-board with him, and to have a clerk imposed on us.

1667-08-14 22:22   No news yet come of the ratification of the peace which we have expected now every hour since yesterday.

1667-08-14 17:40   I took coach and to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Country Captain,” which is a very ordinary play. Methinks I had no pleasure therein at all.

1667-08-14 13:57   My wife being gone to the whitster’s again to her clothes, I to dinner to Sir W. Batten’s, where much of our discourse concerning Carcasse, who it seems do find success before the Council, and do everywhere threaten us with what he will prove against us, which do vex us.

1667-08-14 11:57   Up, and to the office, where we held a meeting extraordinary upon some particular business, and there sat all the morning.

1667-08-13 21:03   I to the office to finish my letters, and then home to my chamber to sing and pipe till my wife comes home from her washing, which was nine at night, and a dark and rainy night, that I was troubled at her staying out so long.

1667-08-13 17:26   Sir W. Pen and I to the King’s house, and there saw “The Committee,” which I went to with some prejudice, not liking it before, but I do now find it a very good play, and a great deal of good invention in it; but Lacy’s part is so well performed that it would set off anything.

1667-08-13 12:10   Home to dinner all alone, my wife being again at the whitster’s.

1667-08-13 10:20   With Sir W. Pen to St. James’s, where the rest come and attended the Duke of York, with our usual business; who, upon occasion, told us that he did expect this night or tomorrow to hear from Breda of the consummation of the peace.

1667-08-12 17:44 r Here Sir Philip Frowde, who sat next to me, did tell me how Sir H. Belasses is dead, and that the quarrel between him and Tom Porter, who is fled, did arise in the ridiculous fashion that I was first told it, which is a strange thing between two so good friends.

1667-08-12 17:40 r  Here was many fine ladies – among others, the German Baron, with his lady, who is envoyé from the Emperour, and their fine daughter, which hath travelled all Europe over with them, it seems; and is accordingly accomplished, and indeed, is a wonderful pretty woman.

1667-08-12 17:32   Alone to the King’s playhouse and there did sit just before Mrs. Pierce and Mrs. Knepp, who pulled me by the hair; and so I addressed myself to them, and talked to them all the intervals of the play, and did give them fruit. The play is “Brenoralt” which I do find but little in.

1667-08-12 13:50   Home, and my wife and maids being gone over the water to the whitster’s with their clothes, this being the first time of her trying this way of washing her linen, I dined at Sir W. Batten’s.

1667-08-12 10:45   To my bookseller’s, and did buy Scott’s Discourse of Witches; and do hear Mr. Cowley mightily lamented his death, by Dr. Ward, the Bishop of Winchester, and Dr. Bates, who were standing there, as the best poet of our nation, and as good a man.

1667-08-12 05:17 r And then I did la otra cosa con her, which I had not done con ella for these tres meses past, which I do believe is a great matter towards the making her of late so indifferent towards me, and with good reason; but now she had much pleasure, and so to sleep again.

1667-08-12 05:15   My wife waked betimes to call up her maids to washing, and so to bed again, whom I then hugged, it being cold now in the mornings.

1667-08-11 22:04 r Took coach again, and got home with great content, just at day shutting in, and so as soon as home eat a little and then to bed, with exceeding great content at our day’s work.

1667-08-11 18:32 r We took coach again, and back to Barnett, where W. Hewer took us into his lodging, and there did treat us very highly with cheesecakes, cream, tarts, and other good things; and then walked into the garden, and there filled my pockets full of filberts, and so with much pleasure.

1667-08-11 16:15 r Being come back, and weary with the walk, for as I made it, it was pretty long, being come back to our inne, there the women had pleasure in putting on some straw hats, which are much worn in this country, and did become them mightily, but especially my wife.

1667-08-11 15:22 r We walked out into the Park through the fine walk of trees and to the Vineyard, and there showed them that, a place of great delight; which, together with our fine walk through the Park, was of as much pleasure as could be desired in the world for country pleasure and good ayre.

1667-08-11 11:50 r To church, it being just church-time, and there we find my Lord and my Lady Sands and several fine ladies of the family, and a great many handsome faces and genteel persons more in the church, and did hear a most excellent good sermon, which pleased me mightily, and very devout.

1667-08-11 10:45 r Took coach again, and W. Hewer on horseback with us, and so to Hatfield, to the inn, next my Lord Salisbury’s house, and there rested ourselves, and drank, and bespoke dinner.

1667-08-11 08:55 r Here was W. Hewer, so, after drinking three glasses and the women nothing, we back by coach to Barnett, where to the Red Lyon, where we ’light, and went up into the great Room, and there drank, and eat some of the best cheese-cakes that ever I eat in my life.

1667-08-11 07:02 r We got to the Wells at Barnett by seven o’clock, and there found many people a-drinking; but the morning is a very cold morning, so as we were very cold all the way in the coach.

1667-08-11 05:10   Up by four o’clock, and ready with Mrs. Turner to take coach before five; which we did, and set on our journey.

1667-08-10 21:02   To finish my letters by the post, and so home, and betimes to bed with my wife because of rising betimes tomorrow.

1667-08-10 17:38   To the New Exchange, to the bookseller’s there, where I hear of several new books coming out — Mr. Spratt’s History of the Royal Society, and Mrs. Phillips’s poems. Sir John Denham’s poems are going to be all printed together.

1667-08-10 13:37   Home to dinner, where I sang and piped with my wife with great pleasure, and did hire a coach to carry us to Barnett tomorrow.

1667-08-09 23:40   So home and to supper, and bed, my head most full of an answer I have drawn this noon to the Committee of the Council to whom Carcasses business is referred to be examined again.

1667-08-09 22:27   With Sir W. Coventry very late, till I could hardly get a coach or link willing to go through the ruines; but I do, but will not do it again, being, indeed, very dangerous.

1667-08-09 14:40   When I come home, and find Mr. Goodgroome, my wife’s singing-master, there I did soundly rattle him for neglecting her so much as he hath done — she not having learned three songs these three months and more.

1667-08-09 10:28   Sir H. Cholmly and I talked, and he do really declare that he expects that of necessity this kingdom will fall back again to a commonwealth, and other wise men are of the same mind.

1667-08-08 16:42   I met Mr. Evelyn, and talked of several things, but particularly of the times: he tells me that wise men do prepare to remove abroad what they have, for that we must be ruined, our case being past relief, the kingdom so much in debt, and the King minding nothing but his lust.

1667-08-08 12:32   Creed tells me that Sir Henry Bellasses is dead of the duell he fought about ten days ago, with Tom Porter; and it is pretty to see how the world talk of them as a couple of fools, that killed one another out of love.

1667-08-07 17:30   My wife abroad with her maid Jane and Tom all the afternoon, being gone forth to eat some pasties at “The Bottle of Hay,” in St. John’s Street, as you go to Islington, of which she is mighty fond.

1667-08-07 15:13 r And Mr. Pierce says my Lady Castlemayne made the King ask her forgiveness upon his knees, and promised to offend her no more so that, indeed, she did threaten to bring all his bastards to his closet-door, and hath nearly hectored him out of his wits.

1667-08-07 15:10   Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, tells me that though the King and my Lady Castlemayne are friends again, she is not at White Hall, but at Sir D. Harvy’s, whither the King goes to her.

1667-08-06 22:32   My wife, as she said last night, hath put away Nell today, for her gossiping abroad and telling of stories.

1667-08-06 22:20 r Sir W. Batten did tell me tonight that the Council have ordered a hearing before them of Carcasses business, which do vex me mightily, that we should be troubled so much by an idle rogue, a servant of our own, and all my thoughts tonight have been how to manage the matter.

1667-08-06 22:15   Into the garden with my wife, and to Sir W. Batten’s with W. Pen and J. Minnes, and there eat a melon and talked, and so home to supper and to bed.

1667-08-06 14:02   I to the Office, only met at the door with Mrs. Martin and Mrs. Burroughs, who I took in and drank with, but was afraid my wife should see them, they being, especially the first, a prattling gossip, and so after drinking with them parted, and I to the Office.

1667-08-06 13:10   Home to dinner, where I find Mrs. Wood, formerly Bab. Shelden, and our Mercer, who is dressed today in a paysan dress, that looks mighty pretty. We dined and sang and laughed mighty merry.

1667-08-06 10:40   My Lord Anglesey did tell us that the Dutch do make a further bogle with us about two or three things, which they will be satisfied in, he says, by us easily.

1667-08-05 20:47   My wife mighty angry with Nell, who is turned a very gossip, and gads abroad as soon as our backs are turned, and will put her away tomorrow, which I am not sorry for.

1667-08-05 17:28   Sir W. Pen and my wife and I to the Duke of York’s house, and there saw “Love Trickes, or the School of Compliments;” a silly play, only Mis’s dancing in a shepherd’s clothes did please us mightily.

1667-08-05 11:50   To the Exchange, where I hear the ill news of our loss lately of four rich ships, two from Guinea, one from Gallipoly, all with rich oyles; and the other from Barbadoes, worth, as is guessed, 80,000l.

1667-08-05 10:28   I spied Signor Francisco tuning his gittar, and Monsieur de Puy with him, who did make him play to me, which he did most admirably — so well as I was mightily troubled that all that pains should have been taken upon so bad an instrument.

1667-08-04 22:47   Busy at my office from morning till night, in writing with my own hand fair our large general account of the expence and debt of the Navy, which lasted me till night to do, that I was almost blind.

1667-08-03 23:14   Hard to work till very late and my eyes began to fail me, which now upon very little overworking them they do, which grieves me much.

1667-08-03 15:38   To the office again, there to enable myself, by finishing our great account, to give it to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury; which I did, and there was called in to them, to tell them only the total of our debt of the Navy on the 25th of May last, which is above 950,000l.

1667-08-02 23:58   Home to supper and to bed, my wife being gone in an ill humour to bed before me.

1667-08-02 21:48   To the office, where and with my Lord Bruncker at his lodgings all the afternoon and evening making up our great account for the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, but not so as pleased me yet.

1667-08-02 12:10 r I do think by something too my wife said to-day, that she took notice that I had not lain with her this half-year, that she thinks that I have some doubt that she might be with child by somebody else.

1667-08-02 12:03   My wife comes to me alone, and tells me she had those upon her and bid me remember it. I asked her why, and she said she had a reason.

1667-08-02 07:05 r So my wife up and come to me and added more, and spoke basely of my father, who I perceive did do something in the country, at her last being there, that did not like her, but I would not enquire into anything, but let her talk.

1667-08-02 06:50   Before I rose my wife fell into angry discourse of my kindness yesterday to Mrs. Knipp, and leading her, and sitting in the coach hand in hand, and my arm about her middle, and in some bad words reproached me with it.

1667-08-01 22:10 r We home, and at Newgate we find them in trouble, some thieves having this night broke open prison. And our coachman was fain to drive hard from two or three fellows, which he said were rogues, that he met at the end of Blow-bladder Street, next Cheapside.

1667-08-01 19:50 r After the play, we into the house, and spoke with Knipp, who went abroad with us by coach to the Neat Houses in the way to Chelsy; and there, in a box in a tree, we sat and sang, and talked and eat; my wife out of humour, as she always is, when this woman is by.

1667-08-01 17:04 r To the King’s house, to see “The Custome of the Country.” The house mighty empty — more than ever I saw it — and an ill play.

1667-08-01 13:35 r Mrs. Markham was here, with her great belly. I was very merry, and after dinner, upon a motion of the women, I was got to go to the play with them — the first I have seen since before the Dutch coming upon our coast.

1667-08-01 13:20   My wife and I dined at Sir W. Pen’s, only with Mrs. Turner and her husband, on a damned venison pasty, that stunk like a devil. However, I did not know it till dinner was done.
