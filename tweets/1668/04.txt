1668-04-24 22:10   home, and there to Sir W. Pen’s and supped and sat talking there late, having no where else to go, and my eyes too bad to read right, and so home to bed.

1668-04-24 14:11   Down to the Old Swan, and by the way called at Michell’s, and there did see Betty, and that was all, for either she is shy or foolish, and su marido hath no mind para laisser me see su moher.

1668-04-24 10:23 r Here did I endeavour to see my pretty woman that I did besar in las tenebras a little while despues. And did find her sola in the boutique, but had not la confidence para hablar a ella. So lost my pains.

1668-04-24 10:04   To Ducke Lane, and there did overlook a great many of Monsieur Fouquet’s library, that a bookseller hath bought, and I did buy one Spanish, “Los Illustres Varones.”

1668-04-24 08:50   By water to White Hall, to the Duke of York, and there hear that this day Hollis and Temple purpose to bring in the petition against Sir W. Coventry, which I am sorry for, but hope he will get out of it.

1668-04-23 22:48 r Walking towards home, just at my entrance into the ruines at St. Dunstan’s, I was met by two rogues with clubs, who come towards us. So I went back, and walked home quite round by the wall, and got well home, and to bed weary

1668-04-23 22:00 r And there Knepp and I drank; and yo did tocar her corps all over and besar sans fin her, but did not offer algo mas; and so back, and led her home.

1668-04-23 20:47 r I carried Mrs. Pierce home, and then Knepp and I to the Temple again, and took boat, it being darkish, and to Fox Hall, it being now night, and a bonfire burning at Lambeth for the King’s coronation-day.

1668-04-23 17:32 r Thence by water to the Temple, and there to the Cocke alehouse, and drank, and eat a lobster, and sang, and mighty merry.

1668-04-23 14:15 r I carried them to the Tower, and shewed them all to be seen there, and, among other things, the Crown and Scepters and rich plate, which I myself never saw before, and indeed is noble, and I mightily pleased with it.

1668-04-23 12:50   Up, and to the office, where all the morning, and at noon comes Knepp and Mrs. Pierce, and her daughter, and one Mrs. Foster, and dined with me, and mighty merry.

1668-04-22 23:10 r And then I away, and got a coach, and so home, where I find Balty and his wife come to town, and did sup with them, and so they to bed.

1668-04-22 22:04 r And there with music and good company, Manuel and his wife, and one Swaddle, a clerk of Lord Arlington’s, who dances, and speaks French well, but got drunk, and was then troublesome, and here mighty merry.

1668-04-22 17:28   So to the fishmonger’s, and bought a couple of lobsters, and over to the ’sparagus garden, thinking to have met Mr. Pierce, and his wife and Knepp; but met their servant coming to bring me to Chatelin’s, the French house, in Covent Garden.

1668-04-22 15:04 r I from the Privy-stairs and, taking water, the Duke of York called to me whither I was going? and I answered, “To wait on our maisters at Westminster;” at which he and all the company laughed; but I was sorry for it afterwards, for fear any Parliament-man should have been there.

1668-04-22 14:20 r Here was today a proposition made to the Duke of York by Captain Von Hemskirke for 20,000l., to discover an art how to make a ship go two foot for one what any ship do now, which the King inclines to try, it costing him nothing to try.

1668-04-22 14:04   To White Hall, and there we attended the Duke of York as usual; and I did present Mrs. Pett, the widow, and her petition to the Duke of York, for some relief from the King.

1668-04-22 13:30   I toward White Hall, and stopped and dined all alone at Hercules Pillars, where I was mighty pleased to overhear a woman talk to her counsel how she had troubled her neighbours with law, and did it very roguishly and wittily.

1668-04-21 21:15   Sir W. Pen’s impeachment was agreed to in the House, and ordered to be engrossed; and he suspended the House – Harman set at liberty – and Brouncker put out of the House, and a writ for a new election, and an impeachment ordered to be brought in against him, he being fled!

1668-04-21 20:30 r Had the opportunity the first time to be bold with Knepp by putting my hand abaxo de her coats and tocar su thights and venter – and a little of the other thing, ella but a little opposing me; su skin very douce and I mightily pleased with this; and so left her at home.

1668-04-21 19:42   To the King’s house, and saw “The Indian Emperour;” and after that done, took Knepp out, and to Kensington; and there walked in the garden, and then supped, and mighty merry, there being also in the house Sir Philip Howard, and some company, and had a dear reckoning, but merry.

1668-04-20 22:20   Home, and there to W. Pen’s and sat and talked there with his wife and children a good while, he being busy in his closet, I believe preparing his defence in Parliament.

1668-04-20 21:15   Took coach and I all alone to Hyde Park (passing through Duck Lane among the booksellers, only to get a sight of the pretty little woman I did salute the other night, and did in passing), and so all the evening in the Park, being a little unwilling to be seen there.

1668-04-20 11:10   To Committee of Accounts, and delivered my paper, and had little discourse, and was unwilling to stay long with them to enter into much, but away and glad to be from them, though very civil to me, but cunning and close I see they are.

1668-04-20 09:04   I to White Hall, and hear how Henry Brouncker is fled, which, I think, will undo him: but what good it will do Harman I know not, he hath so befooled himself; but it will be good sport to my Lord Chancellor to hear how his great enemy is fain to take the same course that he is.

1668-04-20 07:00   Up betimes and to the getting ready my answer to the Committee of Accounts to several questions, which makes me trouble, though I know of no blame due to me from any, let them enquire what they can out.

1668-04-19 17:30   To walk in the Abbey with Sir John Talbot, who would fain have pumped me about the prizes, but I would not let him, and so to walk towards Michell’s to see her, but could not, and so to Martin’s, and her husband was at home, and so took coach and to the Park.

1668-04-19 13:05   Roger Pepys did tell me the whole story of Harman, how he prevaricated, and hath undoubtedly been imposed on, and wheedled; and he is called the miller’s man that, in Richard the Third’s time, was hanged for his master.

1668-04-18 22:22   So home by coach, calling in Duck Lane, and did get Des Cartes’ Musique in English, and so home and wrote my letters, and then to my chamber to save my eyes, and to bed.

1668-04-18 10:03   Do hear that Harman is committed by the Parliament last night, the day he come up, which is hard; but he took all upon himself first, and then when a witness come in to say otherwise, he would have retracted; and the House took it so ill, they would commit him.

1668-04-17 22:41 r Mighty merry, and sang all the way to the town, a most pleasant evening, moonshine, and set them at her house in Covent Garden, and I home and to bed.

1668-04-17 20:01 r After the play, Knepp, and I, and Rolt, by coach, to Kensington, and there to the Grotto, and had admirable pleasure with their singing, and fine ladies listening to us: with infinite pleasure, I enjoyed myself.

1668-04-17 17:32   With Brouncker, to the King’s house, and saw “The Surprizall,” where base singing, only Knepp, who come, after her song in the clouds, to me in the pit.

1668-04-17 14:04   Did little business with the Duke of York. Hear that the House is upon the business of Harman, who, they say, takes all on himself.

1668-04-17 13:20   By coach to White Hall: the coachman on Ludgate Hill ‘lighted, and beat a fellow with a sword.

1668-04-17 06:40   Called up by Balty’s coming, who gives me a good account of his voyage, and pleases me well, and I hope hath got something.

1668-04-16 22:12   Begun this day to learn the Recorder.

1668-04-16 22:10   Wrote my letters to my Lady Sandwich, and so home, where displeased to have my maid bring her brother, a countryman, to lye there, and so to bed.

1668-04-16 15:50   Went with G. Montagu to his house, where he told how W. Pen hath been severe to Lord Sandwich; but the Coventrys both labouring to save him, by laying it on Lord Sandwich, which our friends cry out upon, and I am silent, but do believe they did it as the only way to save him.

1668-04-16 14:35   To Westminster Hall, where I hear W. Pen is ordered to be impeached.

1668-04-16 13:27   Dined with my clerks: and merry at Sir W. Pen’s crying yesterday, as they say, to the King, that he was his martyr.

1668-04-15 21:37   An ill discourse in the morning of my Lord’s being killed, but this evening Godolphin tells us here that my Lord is well.

1668-04-15 17:10   To the King’s playhouse, into a corner of the 18d. box, and there saw “The Maid’s Tragedy,” a good play.

1668-04-15 14:30   To White Hall by water, and there with the Duke of York a little, but stayed not, but saw him and his lady at his little pretty chapel, where I never was before: but silly devotion, God knows!

1668-04-15 13:08   By water to White Hall, and there to the Chapel, expecting wind musick and to the Harp-and-Ball, and drank all alone, Back, and to the fiddling concert, and heard a practice mighty good of Grebus.

1668-04-15 11:15   After playing a little upon my new little flageolet, that is so soft that pleases me mightily, betimes to my office, where most of the morning.

1668-04-14 22:15   To a play, “Love’s Cruelty,” and so to my Lord Crew’s, who glad of this day’s time got, and so home, and there office, and then home to supper and to bed, my eyes being the better upon leaving drinking at night.

1668-04-14 14:00   With Godage and G. Montagu to G. Carteret’s, and there sat their dinner-time: and hear myself, by many Parliament-men, mightily commended.

1668-04-14 11:18   To Commissioners of Accounts and there examined, and so back to Westminster Hall, where all the talk of committing all to the Tower, and Creed and I to the Quaker’s, dined together.

1668-04-13 22:10   Come home, met with order of Commissioners of Accounts, which put together with the rest vexed me, and so home to supper and to bed.

1668-04-13 17:58   So with Creed to a play. Little laugh, thence towards the Park by coach.

1668-04-13 13:01   With G. Montagu and Roger Pepys, and spoke with Birch and Vaughan, all in trouble about the prize business. So to Lord Crew’s (calling for a low pipe by the way), where Creed and G. M. and G. C. come.

1668-04-12 21:00   Dined at Brouncker’s, and saw the new book. Peace. Cutting away sails.

1668-04-11 21:00   News of Peace. Conning my gamut.

1668-04-10 16:22   So to piper and Duck Lane, and there kissed bookseller’s wife, and bought Legend. So home, coach. Sailor. Mrs. Hannam dead.

1668-04-10 12:50   All the morning at Office. At noon with W. Pen to Duke of York, and attended Council.

1668-04-09 22:10   And so home, and there to the perfecting my getting the scale of music without book, which I have done to perfection backward and forward, and so to supper and to bed.

1668-04-09 18:38   To my office, where come a packet from the Downes from my brother Balty, who, with Harman, is arrived there, of which this day come the first news. Balty is very well, and I hope hath performed his work well, that I may get him into future employment.

1668-04-09 16:40   To the New Exchange, there to meet Mrs Burroughs and did tomar her in a carosse and carry ella towards the Park, kissing her and tocando su breast, so as to make myself do; and did give her wrapt in paper for my Valentine’s gift for the last year before this, twelve half-crowns.

1668-04-09 15:20   To the Duke of York’s playhouse, there to see, which I did, Sir W. Davenant’s corpse carried out towards Westminster, there to be buried. Here were many coaches and six horses, and many hacknies, that made it look, methought, as if it were the buriall of a poor poet.

1668-04-08 20:44 r I know I shall be able hereafter to show the world a simpler way; but, like the old hypotheses in philosophy, it must be learned, though a man knows a better.

1668-04-08 20:41   Home to my chamber, to be fingering of my Recorder, and getting of the scale of musique without book, which I at last see is necessary for a man that would understand music as it is now taught to understand, though it be a ridiculous and troublesome way.

1668-04-08 19:24 r But the sport is, Sir Robert Holmes do seem to be mad too with his brother, and will disinherit him, saying that he hath ruined himself, marrying below himself, and to his disadvantage.

1668-04-08 19:20   Mrs. Turner did tell me of young Captain Holmes’s marrying of Pegg Lowther last Saturday by stealth, which I was sorry for, he being an idle rascal, and proud, and worth little, I doubt; and she a mighty pretty, well-disposed lady, and good fortune.

1668-04-08 18:04   I to Drumbleby’s, and there did talk a great deal about pipes; and did buy a recorder, which I do intend to learn to play on, the sound of it being, of all sounds in the world, most pleasing to me.

1668-04-08 17:10   With Lord Brouncker to the Duke of York’s playhouse, where we saw “The Unfortunate Lovers,” no extraordinary play, methinks.

1668-04-07 19:14 r Knipp tells me mighty news, that my Lady Castlemayne is mightily in love with Hart of their house: and he is much with her in private, and she goes to him, and do give him many presents.

1668-04-07 18:50 r I took Knipp to the Lodge, and there treated her and had a deal of good talk, and now and then did besar la, and that was all, and that as much or more than I had much mind to because of her paint.

1668-04-07 18:10 r Here I hear Sir W. Davenant is just now dead; and so who will succeed him in the mastership of the house is not yet known. The eldest Davenport is, it seems, gone from this house to be kept by somebody; which I am glad of, she being a very bad actor.

1668-04-07 17:38 r Here I saw a wonderful pretty maid of her own, that come to undress her, and one so pretty that she says she intends not to keep her, for fear of her being undone in her service, by coming to the playhouse.

1668-04-07 17:32 r I down to Knipp, and did stay her undressing herself; and there saw the several players, men and women go by; and pretty to see how strange they are all, one to another, after the play is done.

1668-04-07 17:04   I by coach to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The English Monsieur;” sitting for privacy sake in an upper box: the play hath much mirth in it as to that particular humour.

1668-04-06 21:21   I home and to my chamber, and there about my music notions again, wherein I take delight and find great satisfaction in them.

1668-04-06 16:50 r …and himself went to the foulest whore he could find, that he might get the pox; and did, and did give his wife it on purpose, that she might give it the Duke of York, which she did, and he did give it the Duchesse; and since all her children are thus sickly and infirm.

1668-04-06 16:48   Creed tells me more of Lady Kerneagy; how her Lord, finding her and the Duke of York at the King’s first coming in too kind, did get it out of her that he did dishonour him, and so bid her continue to let him…

1668-04-06 15:14   Creed and I to the new Cocke-pitt by the King’s gate, and there saw two battles of cocks, wherein is no great sport, but only to consider how these creatures do fight and kill one another, and aim only at one another’s heads, and will not leave till one of them be killed.

1668-04-06 13:58 r I do hear that my Lady Castlemayne is horribly vexed at the late libell, the petition of the poor whores about the town, whose houses were pulled down the other day. I have got one of them, but it is not very witty, but devilish severe against her and the King.

1668-04-06 13:40 r Here I do hear, as a great secret, that the King, and Duke of York and Duchesse, and my Lady Castlemayne, are now all agreed in a strict league, and all things like to go very current, and that it is not impossible to have my Lord Clarendon, in time, here again.

1668-04-06 13:27 r Here Mr. Montagu did tell me how Mr. Vaughan, in that very room, did say that I was a great man, and had great understanding, and I know not what, which, I confess, I was a little proud of, if I may believe him.

1668-04-06 12:55 r He is a fine gentleman and among many sons there was a little daughter that is pretty, of which he is infinite fond, and did make her play on the gittar and sing, which she did mighty prettily, and seems to have a mighty musical soul, keeping time with most excellent spirit.

1668-04-06 12:10   With Sir Herbert Price to Mr. George Montagu’s to dinner, being invited by him in the hall, and there mightily made of, even to great trouble to me to be so commended before my face, with that flattery and importunity, that I was quite troubled with it.

1668-04-06 09:40   Contrary to what could be believed, the King and Duke of York themselves, in my absence, did call for some of the Commissioners of the Treasury, and give them directions about the business, which I, not thinking that they would think of it themselves, did rest satisfied.

1668-04-05 21:00   I hear that eight of the ringleaders in the late tumults of the ’prentices at Easter are condemned to die.

1668-04-05 13:45 r The best way to have it well done, were to have the whole trust in one, as myself, to set whom I pleased to work in the several businesses of the Office, and me to be accountable for the whole, and that would do it, as I would find instruments: but this is not to be compassed.

1668-04-05 13:37   W. Hewer and I a great deal of good talk touching this Office, how it is spoiled by having so many persons in it, and so much work that is not made the work of any one man, but of all, and so is never done.

1668-04-04 22:10   After having done a few letters at the office, I home to a little supper and so to bed, my eyes being every day more and more weak and apt to be tired.

1668-04-04 16:45   My Lord Brouncker and I into the Park in his coach, and there took a great deal of ayre, saving that it was mighty dusty, and so a little unpleasant.

1668-04-04 15:15   The King did easily agree to what we moved, and would have the Commissioners of the Navy to meet us: and then to talk of other things; about the Quakers not swearing, and how they do swear in the business of a late election of a Knight of the Shire of Hartfordshire.

1668-04-04 14:35   The Duke of York did tell us what rules he had of knowing the weather, and did tell us we should have rain before tomorrow, it having been a dry season for some time; and pretty rules he hath, and told Brouncker and me some of them.

1668-04-04 10:50   After long waiting did get a small running Committee of Tangier, and little done but the correcting egregious faults in the Charter for Tangier after it had so long lain before the Council and been passed there by the Atturny General, so slightly are all things in this age done.

1668-04-04 09:10   I called upon one Hayward, that makes virginalls, and did there like of a little espinette, and will have him finish it for me; for I had a mind to a small harpsichon, but this takes up less room.

1668-04-03 22:04   This day I hear that Prince Rupert and Holmes do go to sea: and by this there is a seeming friendship and peace among our great seamen; but the devil a bit is there any love among them, or can be.

1668-04-03 20:40   Home, and there to read a little, and eat a little, though I find that my having so little taste do make me so far neglect eating that, unless company invite, I do not love to spend time upon eating, and so bring emptiness and the Cholique.

1668-04-03 17:30   My Lord Brouncker and I to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there saw part of “The Master and the Man,” and thence to Duck Lane, to look out for Marsanne, in French, a man that has wrote well of music, but it is not to be had, but I have given order for its being sent for over.

1668-04-03 13:55 r I was unwilling to enter into a contest with them; but took advantage of two or three words last spoke, and brought it to a short issue in good words, that if we had the King’s order to hold our hands, we would, which did end the matter.

1668-04-03 13:40   I did hear Mr. Sollicitor make his Report to the Council; which he did in a most excellent manner of words, but most cruelly severe against us, and so were some of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, as men guilty of a practice with the tradesmen, to the King’s prejudice.

1668-04-03 09:03   Captain Perryman tells me how Tatnell told him that one How is to charge me before the Commissioners of Prizes to the value of 8000l. in prizes, which I was troubled to hear, so fearful I am, though I know that there is not a penny to be laid to my charge that I dare not own.

1668-04-02 18:40 r With Lord Brouncker and several of them to the King’s Head Taverne by Chancery Lane, and there did drink and eat and talk, and I did hear of Mr. Hooke and my Lord an account of the reason of concords and discords in music, which they say is from the equality of vibrations.

1668-04-02 17:10 r Here, to my great content, I did try the use of the Otacousticon, which was only a great glass bottle broke at the bottom, putting the neck to my eare, and there I did plainly hear the dashing of the oares of the boats in the Thames to Arundell gallery window.

1668-04-02 16:04   With Lord Brouncker to the Royall Society, where I was forced to subscribe to the building of a College, and did give 40l; and several others did subscribe, some greater and some less sums; but several I saw hang off: and I doubt it will spoil the Society for it breeds ill-will.

1668-04-02 08:10 r And so in two coaches set out towards the carrier, there for to take coach for my father’s. I meeting my Lord Anglesey going to the Office, was forced to ’light in Cheapside, and there took my leave of them (not baisado Deb., which je had a great mind to).

1668-04-02 07:40 r My wife and I up, and she got her ready to be gone, and by and by comes Betty Turner and her mother, and W. Batelier, and they and Deb., to whom I did give 10s. this morning, to oblige her to please her mistress (and ego did baiser her mouche), and also Jane.

1668-04-02 06:50   Up, after much pleasant talk with my wife, and upon some alterations I will make in my house in her absence, and I do intend to lay out some money thereon.

1668-04-01 20:50 r Mrs. Turner afterwards did take me into my closet, and give me a cellar of waters of her own distilling for my father, to be carried down with my wife and her daughter tomorrow, which was very handsome.

1668-04-01 20:20 r To talk with Mr Turner about the Office and his place, which, by Sir J Minnes’s age and inability, is uncomfortable to him as well as without profit, or certainty what he shall do, when Sir J. Minnes dies, which is a sad condition for a man that hath lived so long in the Office.

1668-04-01 19:38   Home, and there to my chamber till anon comes Mr. Turner and his wife and daughter, and Pelling, to sup with us and talk of my wife’s journey tomorrow, her daughter going with my wife.

1668-04-01 17:15 r It was pretty to see how coming after dinner and with no company with me to talk to, and at a play that I had seen, and went to now not for curiosity but only idleness, I did fall asleep the former part of the play, but afterward did mind it and like it very well.

1668-04-01 17:10   All alone to the King’s house, and there sat in an upper box, to hide myself, and saw “The Black Prince,” a very good play; but only the fancy, most of it, the same as in the rest of my Lord Orrery’s plays; but the dance very stately.

1668-04-01 12:49   Out to bespeak some things against my wife’s going into the country tomorrow, and so home to dinner, my wife and I alone, she being mighty busy getting her things ready for her journey.

1668-04-01 07:15   Up, and to dress myself, and called Deb. to brush and dress me and there I did again as I did the last night con mi mano, but would have tocado su thing; but ella endeavoured to prevent me con much modesty by putting su hand there about, which I was well pleased with.
