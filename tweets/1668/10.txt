1668-10-31 22:19 r I have reason to be sorry and ashamed of it, and more to be troubled for the poor girl’s sake, whom I fear I shall by this means prove the ruin of, though I shall think myself concerned both to love and be a friend to her.

1668-10-31 22:17   So ends this month with some quiet to my mind, though not perfect, after the greatest falling out with my poor wife, and through my folly with the girl, that ever I had.

1668-10-31 22:15   To my chamber with Gibson to do more about my great answer for the Duke of York, and so at night after supper to bed well pleased with my advance thereon.

1668-10-31 06:32   Slept heartily, my wife and I at good peace, but my heart troubled and her mind not at ease, I perceive, she against and I for the girl, to whom I have not said anything these three days, but resolve to be mighty strange in appearance to her.

1668-10-30 10:55 r And so I do resolve to have a coach of Mr. Povy’s build, and with his advice, both in coach and horses, he being the fittest man in the world for it, and so he carried me home, and said the same to my wife.

1668-10-30 10:20 r Mr. Povy and I to talk of my coach, and I got him to go see it, where he finds most infinite fault with it, both as to being out of fashion and heavy, with so good reason that I am mightily glad of his having corrected me in it.

1668-10-30 09:25 r He tells that the Duke of York, in all things but in his cod-piece, is led by the nose by his wife. That W. Coventry is now, by the Duke of York, made friends with the Duchess; and that he is often there, and waits on her.

1668-10-30 09:15   Mr. Povy tells how the King is made a child of, by Buckingham and Arlington, to the lessening of the Duke of York, whom they cannot suffer to be great, for fear of my Lord Chancellor’s return, which, therefore, they make the King violent against.

1668-10-29 22:02   Home all the afternoon to do business towards my drawing up an account for the Duke of York of the answers of this office to his late great letter, and late at it, and so to bed, with great peace from my wife and quiet, I bless God.

1668-10-29 10:36 r But Mr. Wren do own that the Duke of York is the most wounded in this, for it is done and concluded without his privity, after his appearing for Lord Anglesey, and that it is plain that they do ayme to bring the Admiralty into Commission too, and lessen the Duke of York.

1668-10-29 10:32   Mr. Wren tells us of the order from the King to the Duke of York, for signifying his pleasure to the Sollicitor-General for drawing up a Commission for suspending of my Lord Anglesey, and putting in Sir Thomas Littleton and Sir Thomas Osborne, during the suspension.

1668-10-28 22:05   This evening Mr. Spong come, and sat late with me, and first told me of the instrument called parallelogram, which I must have one of, shewing me his practice thereon, by a map of England.

1668-10-28 22:00   So after dinner with Mr. Gibson all the afternoon in my closet, and at night to supper and to bed, my wife and I at good peace, but yet with some little grudgings of trouble in her and more in me about the poor girl.

1668-10-28 10:55   Home, calling at one or two places; and there about our workmen, who are at work upon my wife’s closet, and other parts of my house, that we are all in dirt.

1668-10-28 09:30   To White Hall, where, by and by, a Committee met, my Lord Sandwich there, but his report was not received, it being late; but only a little business done, about the supplying the place with victuals.

1668-10-28 08:00 r So up with mighty kindness from my wife and a thorough peace, and being up did by a note advise the girl what I had done and owned, which note I was in pain for till she told me she had burned it.

1668-10-28 07:15 r Being heartily afflicted for this folly of mine that did occasion it was forced to be silent about the girl, which I have no mind to part with, but much less that the poor girl should be undone by my folly.

1668-10-28 07:03 r While the knowing myself to have given some grounds for it, did make it my business to appease her all I could possibly, and by good words and fair promises did make her very quiet, and so rested all night and rose with perfect good peace.

1668-10-27 23:58 r When I offered to rise would have rose too, and caused a candle to be light to burn by her all night in the chimney while she ranted.

1668-10-27 23:55 r My wife did towards bedtime begin to be in a mighty rage from some new matter that she had got in her head, and did most part of the night in bed rant at me in most high terms of threats of publishing my shame.

1668-10-27 21:00 r To the office, my mind mighty full of sorrow for her, where all the morning, and to dinner with my people, and to the office all the afternoon, and so at night home, and there busy to get some things ready against tomorrow’s meeting of Tangier.

1668-10-27 07:03 r She at last upon these promises was quiet, and very kind we were, and so to sleep, and in the morning up, but my mind troubled for the poor girle, with whom I could not get opportunity to speak.

1668-10-26 23:58 r The latter I denied, and truly, the other I confessed and no more, and did give her under my hand that I would never see Mrs. Pierce nor Knepp, but did promise her demonstrations of my true love to her, owning some indiscretions in what I did, but that there was no harm in it.

1668-10-26 23:55 r I all the evening busy, and my wife full of trouble in her looks, and anon to bed, where about midnight she wakes me, and there falls foul of me again, affirming that she saw me hug and kiss the girl.

1668-10-26 13:40   By coach home and to dinner, finding my wife mightily discontented, and the girl sad, and no words from my wife to her. So after dinner they out with me about two or three things, and so home again.

1668-10-26 11:20   To my Lord Sandwich’s, where I to him; and there he, taking physic and keeping his chamber, I had an hour’s talk with him about the ill posture of things at this time, while the King gives countenance to Sir Charles Sidly and Lord Buckhurst.

1668-10-26 08:30   I was obliged to attend the Duke of York, thinking to have had a meeting of Tangier today; but he did press me to prepare what I had to say upon the answers of my fellow-officers to his great letter, which I promised to do against his coming to town again, the next week.

1668-10-26 08:00 r Toward morning a little sleep, and so I with some little repose and rest, rose, and up and by water to White Hall, but with my mind mightily troubled for the poor girl, whom I fear I have undone by this, my wife telling me that she would turn her out of doors.

1668-10-26 02:30 r But after her much crying and reproaching me with inconstancy and preferring a sorry girl before her, I did give her no provocation, but did promise all fair usage to her and love, and foreswore any hurt that I did with her, till at last she seemed to be at ease again.

1668-10-26 02:15 r But she went on from one thing to another till at last it appeared plainly her trouble was at what she saw, but yet I did not know how much she saw, and therefore said nothing to her.

1668-10-26 02:05 r But to bed, and my wife said little also, but could not sleep, but about two in the morning waked me and cried, and fell to tell me as a great secret that she was a Roman Catholique and had received the Holy Sacrament, which troubled me, but I took no notice of it.

1668-10-25 21:42 r I was at a wonderful loss upon it, and the girl also, and I endeavoured to put it off, but my wife was struck mute and grew angry, and so her voice come to her, grew quite out of order, and I to say little.

1668-10-25 21:40   To have my head combed by Deb., which occasioned the greatest sorrow to me that ever I knew in this world, for my wife, coming up suddenly, did find me embracing the girl con my hand sub su coats; and endeed, I was with my main her cunny.

1668-10-24 09:45   There comes also to me Mr. Shotgrave, the operator of our Royal Society, to show me his method of making the Tubes for the eyes, which are clouterly done, so that mine are better, but I have well informed myself in several things from him, and so am glad of speaking with him.

1668-10-24 09:10   Comes to me the coachmaker, and agreed with me for 53l., and stand to the courtesy of what more I should give him upon the finishing of the coach: he is likely also to fit me with a coachman.

1668-10-23 11:45   To my coachmaker’s, and there did come a little nearer agreement for the coach, and so to Duck Lane, and there my bookseller’s, and saw his moher, but ella is so big-bellied that ella is not worth seeing.

1668-10-23 10:12 r And how the King takes their parts; and my Lord Chief Justice Keeling hath laid the constable by the heels to answer it next Sessions: which is a horrid shame.

1668-10-23 10:10 r Pierce do tell me the late frolic and debauchery of Sir Charles Sidly and Buckhurst, running up and down all the night with their arses bare, through the streets; and at last fighting, and being beat by the watch and clapped up all night.

1668-10-23 10:00   With Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, towards Tyburne, to see the people executed; but come too late, it being done; two men and a woman hanged.

1668-10-22 21:20 r Mrs. Turner staid, who was there also to talk of her husband’s business; and the truth is, I was the less pleased to talk with her, for that she hath not yet owned my late and principal service to her husband about his place, which I alone ought to have the thanks for.

1668-10-22 20:58   My Lord and others and I to the Devil tavern, and there eat and drank, and so late, with Mr. Colwell, home by coach; and at home took him with me, and there found my uncle Wight and aunt, and Woolly and his wife, and there supped, and mighty merry.

1668-10-22 14:22   With wife and Deb. to Crow’s, and there did see some more beds; and we shall, I think, pitch upon a camlott one, when all is done.

1668-10-22 08:00   Up, and W. Batelier’s Frenchman, a perriwigg maker, comes and brings me a new one, which I liked and paid him for: a mighty genteel fellow.

1668-10-21 17:32 r But here I hear that Sir Gilbert Pickering is lately dead, about three days since, which makes some sorrow there, though not much, because of his being long expected to die, having been in a lethargy long.

1668-10-21 17:12   I to my Lord Sandwich’s lodgings, who come to town the last night: and met with him within: and among others my new cozen Creed, who looks mighty soberly; and he and I saluted one another with mighty gravity, till we come to a little more freedom of talk about it.

1668-10-21 15:55   To the New Exchange, and there staid for my wife, and she come, we to Cow Lane, and there I showed her the coach which I pitch on, and she is out of herself for joy almost. But the man not within, so did nothing more towards an agreement.

1668-10-21 14:10   To my Lord Brouncker’s, where to meet several gentlemen of the Royal Society, to go and make a visit to the French Embassador Colbert, at Leicester House, he having endeavoured to make one or two to my Lord Brouncker, as our President.

1668-10-21 12:50   To dinner to Mr. Batelier’s, his mother coming this day a-housewarming to him, and several friends of his, to which he invited us. Here mighty merry, and his mother the same; I heretofore took her for a gentlewoman, and understanding.

1668-10-20 23:28   So to my tailor’s, and the New Exchange, and so by coach home, and there, having this day bought “The Queene of Arragon” play, I did get my wife and W. Batelier to read it over this night by 11 o’clock, and so to bed.

1668-10-20 15:00   My wife and Harman and girl abroad to buy things, and I walked out to several places to pay debts, and among other things to look out for a coach, and saw many; and did light on one for which I bid 50l., which do please me mightily, and I believe I shall have it.

1668-10-20 12:10   At this time my wife and I mighty busy laying out money in dressing up our best chamber, and thinking of a coach and coachman and horses, &c.; and the more because of Creed’s being now married to Mrs. Pickering; a thing I could never have expected.

1668-10-20 11:50   Home to dinner, having this day a new girl come to us in the room of Nell, who is lately, about four days since, gone away, being grown lazy and proud. This girl to stay only till we have a boy, which I intend to keep when I have a coach, which I am now about.

1668-10-19 17:57 r Here met W. Batelier and Mrs. Hunt, Deb.’s aunt; and saw her home — a very witty woman, and one that knows this play, and understands a play mighty well.

1668-10-19 17:20   My wife and I to the Duke of York’s playhouse; and saw, the first time acted, “The Queene of Arragon,” an old Blackfriars play, but an admirable one, so good that I am astonished at it, and wonder where it hath lain asleep all this while, that I have never heard of it before.

1668-10-19 13:03   Out by coach with my wife and Deb. and Mr. Harman, the upholster, and carried them to take measure of Mr. Wren’s bed at St. James’s, I being resolved to have just such another made me.

1668-10-18 16:10   With Brouncker to Lincolne’s Inn, and Mr. Ball, to visit Dr. Wilkins, now newly Bishop of Chester: and he received us mighty kindly; and had most excellent discourse from him about his Book of Reall Character.

1668-10-18 11:55   Up, and with my boy Tom all the morning altering the places of my pictures with great pleasure.

1668-10-17 23:55   Late home, and there with much pleasure getting Mr. Gibbs to write the name upon my new draught of “The Resolution;” and so set it up and altered the situation of some of my pictures in my closet, to my extraordinary content, and at it with much pleasure till almost 12 at night.

1668-10-17 15:48 r Mr. Moore tells me the sad condition my Lord is in, in his estate and debts; and the way he now lives in, so high, and so many vain servants about him, that he must be ruined, if he do not take up, which, by the grace of God, I will put him upon, when I come to see him.

1668-10-17 15:30   Mr. Moore and Seymour tell me that my Lord Sandwich was received mighty kindly by the King, and is in exceeding great esteem with him, and the rest about him; but I doubt it will be hard for him to please both the King and the Duke of York, which I shall be sorry for.

1668-10-16 20:10 r And there mighty kindly used, and had a barrel of oysters, and so to look up and down their house, they having hung a room since I was there, but with hangings not fit to be seen with mine, which I find all come home tonight.

1668-10-16 18:30   I with J. Minnes home, and there finding my wife gone to my aunt Wight’s, to see her the first time after her coming to town, and indeed the first time, I think, these two years (we having been great strangers one to the other for a great while), I to them.

1668-10-16 12:28 r And so by Mr. Crow’s, home, about his hangings, and do pitch upon buying his second suit of Apostles — the whole suit, which comes to 83l.; and this we think the best for us, having now the whole suit, to answer any other rooms or service.

1668-10-16 11:40   I took my wife by coach, and Deb., and shewed her Mr. Wren’s hangings and bed, at St. James’s, and Sir W. Coventry’s in the Pell Mell, for our satisfaction in what we are going to buy.

1668-10-15 17:15 r At last I think we shall pitch upon the best suit of Apostles, where three pieces for my room will come to almost 80l.

1668-10-15 17:02   My wife and I and Deb. out by coach to the upholsters in Long Lane, Alderman Reeve’s, and then to Alderman Crow’s, to see variety of hangings, and were mightily pleased therewith, and spent the whole afternoon thereupon.

1668-10-14 17:15 r Went all of us to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Faythful Shepherdess” again, that we might hear the French Eunuch sing, which we did, to our great content; though I do admire his action as much as his singing, being both beyond all I ever saw or heard.

1668-10-14 14:00   I home, and after dinner to St. James’s, and there met my brethren; but the Duke of York being gone out, and tonight being a play there; and a great festival, we would not stay.

1668-10-14 11:15   Sir H. Cholmly and I to walk, and to my Lord Barkeley’s new house; there to see a new experiment of a cart, which, by having two little wheeles fastened to the axle-tree, is said to make it go with half the ease and more, than another cart but we did not see the trial made.

1668-10-14 10:03   To White Hall, and there walked to St. James’s, where I find the Court mighty full, it being the Duke of York’s birthday; and he mighty fine, and all the music, one after another, to my great content.

1668-10-13 22:22   Home and did get my wife to read to me, and then Deb. to comb my head; and here I had the pleasure para touch the cosa of her and all about, with a little opposition; and so to bed.

1668-10-13 17:35 r He did discourse about the business of the Dutch war, which, he says, he was always an enemy to; and did discourse very well of it; and to see how some men may by age come to know much, and yet by their drinking and other pleasures render themselves not very considerable.

1668-10-13 17:09   At my Lord Middleton’s, to give him an account of what I had done this day, with his man, at Alderman Backewell’s, about the getting of his 1000l. paid.

1668-10-13 09:05   When we come to sit down at the Board, comes to us Mr. Wren this day to town, and tells me that James Southern do petition the Duke of York for the Storekeeper’s place of Deptford, which did trouble me much, and also the Board.

1668-10-12 21:00 r So to supper, and after supper to read a ridiculous nonsensical book set out by Will. Pen, for the Quakers; but so full of nothing but nonsense, that I was ashamed to read in it.

1668-10-12 19:15 r My bookseller Shrewsbury comes, and brings my books of Martyrs, and I did pay him for them, and did this night make the young women before supper to open all the volumes for me.

1668-10-12 18:40   Here we met with Mr. Batelier and his sister, and so they home with us in two coaches, and there at my house staid and supped.

1668-10-12 16:30   My wife and Mercer, and W. Hewer and Deb., to the King’s playhouse, and there we did hear the Eunuch (who, it seems, is a Frenchman, but long bred in Italy) sing; but such action and singing I could never have imagined to have heard.

1668-10-12 11:50   Home, where I find Sir H. Cholmly come to town; and is come hither to see me: and he is a man that I love mightily, as being, of a gentleman, the most industrious that ever I saw.

1668-10-12 10:45   Meeting a gentleman of my Lord Middleton’s looking for me, I did go to his Lord’s lodgings, and there spoke the first time with him, and find him a shrewd man, but a drinking man, I think, as the world says; but a man that hath seen much of the world, and is a Scot.

1668-10-12 09:20   Up, and with Mr. Turner by water to White Hall, there to think to enquire when the Duke of York will be in town, in order to Mr. Turner’s going down to Audley End about his place.

1668-10-11 22:10 r They and their daughter, and a kinswoman that come along with them, did sup with me, and pretty merry, and then, they gone, and my wife to read to me, and to bed.

1668-10-11 20:27   At night comes Mr. Turner and his wife, and there they tell me that Mr. Harper is dead at Deptford, and so now all his and my care is, how to secure his being Storekeeper in his stead.

1668-10-11 09:20   Up and to church, where I find Parson Mills come to town and preached, and the church full, most people being now come home to town, though the season of year is as good as summer in all respects.
