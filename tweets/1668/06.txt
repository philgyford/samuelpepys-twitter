1668-06-08 21:32 r To Newport Pagnell; and there a good pleasant country-town, but few people in it. A very fair — and like a Cathedral — Church; and I saw the leads, and a vault that goes far under ground.

1668-06-08 15:00 r So to Buckingham, a good old town. Here I to see the Church, which very good, and the leads, and a school in it. A fair bridge here, with many arches: vexed at my people’s making me lose so much time.

1668-06-03 19:38   By coach to Westminster to the Hall, and thence to the Park, where much good company, and many fine ladies; and in so handsome a hackney I was, that I believe Sir W. Coventry and others, who looked on me, did take me to be in one of my own, which I was a little troubled for.

1668-06-02 23:50 r Got there by twelve o’clock, taking into my boat, for company, a man that desired a passage — a certain western bargeman, with whom I had good sport, talking of the old woman of Woolwich, and telling him the whole story.

1668-06-02 22:04 r By water down to Deptford and there it being dark I did by agreement andar a la house de Bagwell; and, after a little playing and besando, we did go up in the dark a su cama and there fasero la grand cosa upon the bed; and that being hecho, did go away and to my boat again.

1668-06-01 11:48   Home, and did walk an hour in the garden with Sir W. Warren, who do tell me of the great difficulty he is under in the business of his accounts with the Commissioners of Parliament, and I fear some inconveniences and troubles may be occasioned thereby to me.

1668-06-01 08:10   Up and with Sir J. Minnes to Westminster, and in the Hall there I met with Harris and Rolt, and carried them to the Rhenish wine-house, where I have not been in a morning — nor any tavern, I think, these seven years and more.
