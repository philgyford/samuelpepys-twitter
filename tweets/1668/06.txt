1668-06-15 21:40 r My wife pleased with all, this evening reading of “Mustapha” to me till supper, and then to supper, and had music whose innocence pleased me, and I did give them 3s.

1668-06-15 20:33 r Come to Marlborough, and lay at the Hart; a good house, and a pretty fair town for a street or two; and what is most singular is, their houses on one side having their pent-houses supported with pillars, which makes it a good walk.

1668-06-15 17:50 r About a mile off, it was prodigious to see how full the Downes are of great stones; and all along the vallies, stones of considerable bigness, most of them growing certainly out of the ground so thick as to cover the ground which makes me think the less of the wonder of Stonage.

1668-06-15 17:40 r So took coach again, seeing one place with great high stones pitched round, which, I believe, was once some particular building, in some measure like that of Stonage.

1668-06-15 17:00 r Come to Abebury, where, seeing great stones like those of Stonage standing up, I stopped and took a countryman of that town, and he carried me and showed me a place trenched in, with great stones pitched in it, some bigger than those at Stonage in figure, to my great admiration.

1668-06-15 16:20 r Took coach, and away, without any of the company of the other stage-coaches, that go out of this town to-day; and rode all day with some trouble, for fear of being out of our way, over the Downes, where the life of the shepherds is, in fair weather only, pretty.

1668-06-15 06:30   Up, and with Mr. Butts to look into the baths, and find the King and Queen’s full of a mixed sort, of good and bad, and the Cross only almost for the gentry.

1668-06-14 21:03 r To supper, and then comes my landlord to me, a sober understanding man, and did give me a good account of the antiquity of this town and Wells; and of two Heads, on two pillars, in Wells church. But he a Catholick.

1668-06-14 16:45 r Took my wife out and the girls, and come to this church again, to see it, and look over the monuments, where, among others, Dr. Venner and Pelling, and a lady of Sir W. Waller’s; he lying with his face broken.

1668-06-14 14:56 r So home to dinner, and after dinner comes Mr. Butts again to see me, and he and I to church, where the same idle fellow preached; and I slept most of the sermon.

1668-06-14 10:22 r Here a good organ; but a vain, pragmatical fellow preached a ridiculous, affected sermon, that made me angry, and some gentlemen that sat next me, and sang well.

1668-06-14 09:30 r And so to the great Church, and there saw Bishop Montagu’s tomb; and, when placed, did there see many brave people come, and, among others, two men brought in, in litters, and set down in the chancel to hear: but I did not know one face.

1668-06-14 08:20   Up, and walked up and down the town, and saw a pretty good market-place, and many good streets, and very fair stone-houses.

1668-06-13 22:10 r We back, and by moonshine to the Bath again, about ten-o’clock: bad way; and giving the coachman 1s. went all of us to bed.

1668-06-13 18:22 r Comes in another poor woman, who, hearing that Deb. was here, did come running hither, and with her eyes so full of tears, and heart so full of joy, that she could not speak when she come in, that it made me weep too.

1668-06-13 17:40 r And so brought us a back way by surprize to his house, where a substantial good house, and well furnished; and did give us good entertainment of strawberries, a whole venison-pasty, cold, and plenty of brave wine, and above all Bristoll milk.

1668-06-13 16:20 r He shewed me the Custom-house, and led us through Marsh Street, where our girl was born. But, Lord! the joy that was among the old poor people of the place, to see Mrs. Willet’s daughter, it seems her mother being a brave woman and mightily beloved!

1668-06-13 15:30 r Walked back to the Sun, where I find Deb. come back, and with her, her uncle, a sober merchant, very good company, and so like one of our sober, wealthy, London merchants, as pleased me mightily.

1668-06-13 15:05 r And so went to the Sun; and there Deb. going with W. Hewer and Betty Turner to see her uncle, and leaving my wife with the mistress of the house, I to see the quay, which is a most large and noble place; and to see the new ship building by Baily. It will be a fine ship.

1668-06-13 14:50 r No carts, it standing generally on vaults, only dog-carts. So to the Three Crowns Tavern I was directed; but, when I come in, the master told me that he had newly given over the selling of wine; it seems, grown rich.

1668-06-13 14:45 r Set out towards Bristoll, and come thither, where set down at the Horseshoe, and there, being trimmed by a very handsome fellow, walked with my wife and people through the city, which is in every respect another London, that one can hardly know it.

1668-06-13 08:20 r Carried away, wrapped in a sheet, and in a chair, home; and there one after another thus carried, I staying above two hours in the water, home to bed, sweating for an hour; and by and by, comes music to play to me, extraordinary good as ever I heard at London almost.

1668-06-13 06:15 r But strange to see, when women and men herein, that live all the season in these waters, that cannot but be parboiled, and look like the creatures of the bath!

1668-06-13 06:10 r Good conversation among them that are acquainted here, and stay together. Strange to see how hot the water is; and in some places, though this is the most temperate bath, the springs so hot as the feet not able to endure.

1668-06-13 05:40 r And by and by, though we designed to have done before company come, much company come; very fine ladies; and the manner pretty enough, only methinks it cannot be clean to go so many bodies together in the same water.

1668-06-13 04:34   Up at four o’clock, being by appointment called up to the Cross Bath, where we were carried one after one another, myself, and wife, and Betty Turner, Willet, and W. Hewer.

1668-06-12 19:04 r We come before night to the Bath; where I presently stepped out with my landlord, and saw the baths, with people in them. They are not so large as I expected, but yet pleasant; and the town most of stone, and clean, though the streets generally narrow.

1668-06-12 12:10 r At Philips-Norton I walked to the Church, and saw a very ancient tomb of some Knight Templar; and saw the tombstone whereon there were only two heads cut, which were two sisters, called the Fair Maids of Foscott, that had two bodies upward and one belly, and there lie buried.

1668-06-12 10:15 r The first town we came to was Brekington, where, we stopping for something for the horses, we called two or three little boys to us, and pleased ourselves with their manner of speech, and did make one of them kiss Deb, and another say the Lord’s Prayer.

1668-06-12 10:00 r So rode a very good way, led to my great content by our landlord to Philips-Norton, with great pleasure, being now come into Somersetshire; where my wife and Deb. mightily joyed thereat, I commending the country, as indeed it deserves.

1668-06-12 07:20   Up, finding our beds good, but lousy; which made us merry. We set out, the reckoning and servants coming to 9s. 6d.

1668-06-11 23:20 r This day from Salisbury I wrote by the post my excuse for not coming home, which I hope will do, for I am resolved to see the Bath, and, it may be, Bristol.

1668-06-11 23:15 r We were fain to go into a room where a pedlar was in bed, and made him rise; and there wife and I lay, and in a truckle-bed Betty Turner and Willett.

1668-06-11 22:50 r And there with great difficulty come about ten at night to a little inn. The master of the house a sober, understanding man, and I had good discourse with him about this country’s matters, as wool, and corne, and other things.

1668-06-11 21:20 r With a guide went over the smooth Plain indeed till night; and then by a happy mistake, and that looked like an adventure, we were carried out of our way to a town where we would lie, since we could not go so far as we would.

1668-06-11 13:32 r So back home; and there being ’light, we to the Church, and there find them at prayers again, so could not see the Quire; but I sent the women home, and I did go in, and saw very many fine tombs, and among the rest some very ancient, of the Montagus.

1668-06-11 11:40 r The three women behind W. Hewer, Murford, and our guide, and I single to Stonage; over the Plain and some great hills, even to fright us. Come thither, and find them as prodigious as any tales I heard of them, and worth going this journey to see. God knows what their use was!

1668-06-11 10:02 r Thence to the inne; and there not being able to hire coach-horses, and not willing to use our own, we got saddle-horses, very dear.

1668-06-11 09:27 r So to my lodging back, and took out my wife and people to shew them the town and Church; but they being at prayers, we could not be shown the Quire. A very good organ; and I looked in, and saw the Bishop, my friend Dr. Ward.

1668-06-11 08:30 r But the Minster most admirable; as big, I think, and handsomer than Westminster: and a most large Close about it, and houses for the Officers thereof, and a fine palace for the Bishop.

1668-06-11 08:10 r Up, and W. Hewer and I up and down the town, and find it a very brave place. The river goes through every street; and a most capacious market-place. The city great, I think greater than Hereford.

1668-06-10 23:43 r Come to the George Inne, where lay in a silk bed; and very good diet. To supper; then to bed.

1668-06-10 22:03 r So all over the Plain by the sight of the steeple, the Plain high and low, to Salisbury; but before I come to the town, I saw a great fortification, and there ’light, and find it prodigious, so as to frighten me to be in it all alone, it being dark.

1668-06-10 14:12 r So come to Hungerford, where very good trouts, eels, and crayfish. A mean town.

1668-06-10 10:10 r So forth towards Hungerford, led this good way by our landlord, one Heart, an old but very civil and well-spoken man, more than I ever heard, of his quality. He gone, we forward; and I vexed at my people’s not minding the way.

1668-06-10 09:40 r So did give the poor, which they would not take but in their box, 2s. 6d. So to the inn, and paid the reckoning and what not, 13s.

1668-06-10 08:10   Up, and walked to the Hospitall: very large and fine; and pictures of founders, and the History of the Hospitall; and is said to be worth; 700l. per annum.

1668-06-09 21:20 r At night come to Abingdon, where had been a fair of custard; and met many people and scholars going home; and there did get some pretty good musick, and sang and danced till supper.

1668-06-09 19:04 r Oxford mighty fine place; and well seated, and cheap entertainment.

1668-06-09 18:12 r Thence with coach and people to Physic-garden. So to Friar Bacon’s study: I up and saw it, and give the man 1s. Bottle of sack for landlord.

1668-06-09 16:28 r After come home from the schools, I out with the landlord to Brazen-nose College; — to the butteries, and in the cellar find the hand of the Child of Hales.

1668-06-09 14:37   To Oxford, a very sweet place. To dinner; and then out with my wife and people, and landlord. And to him that showed us the schools and library, 10s. To him that showed us All Souls’ College, and Chichly’s picture, 5s.

1668-06-08 21:32 r To Newport Pagnell; and there a good pleasant country-town, but few people in it. A very fair — and like a Cathedral — Church; and I saw the leads, and a vault that goes far under ground.

1668-06-08 15:00 r So to Buckingham, a good old town. Here I to see the Church, which very good, and the leads, and a school in it. A fair bridge here, with many arches: vexed at my people’s making me lose so much time.

1668-06-08 11:30   Pleasant country to Bedford, where, while they stay, I rode through the town; and a good country-town.

1668-06-07 22:23   My father, for money lent, and horse-hire, 1l. 11s.

1668-06-06 22:20   Spent at Huntingdon with Bowles, and Appleyard, and Shepley, 2s.

1668-06-05 22:30   At Barnet, for milk, 6d. On the highway, to menders of the highway, 6d. Dinner at Stevenage, 5s. 6d.

1668-06-04 22:23   All the evening to set matters in order against my going to Brampton tomorrow, being resolved upon my journey, and having the Duke of York’s leave again today; though I do plainly see that I can very ill be spared now, there being much business.

1668-06-04 14:10   I carried and set Mr. Clerke, the solicitor, down at the Temple, he observing to me how St. Sepulchre’s church steeple is repaired already a good deal, and the Fleet Bridge is contracted for by the City to begin to be built this summer, which do please me mightily.

1668-06-03 22:10   So to the lodge, and drank a cup of new milk, and so home, and there to Mrs. Turner’s, and sat and talked with her, and then home to bed, having laid my business with W. Hewer to go out of town, with hopes of a great deal of pleasure.

1668-06-03 19:38   By coach to Westminster to the Hall, and thence to the Park, where much good company, and many fine ladies; and in so handsome a hackney I was, that I believe Sir W. Coventry and others, who looked on me, did take me to be in one of my own, which I was a little troubled for.

1668-06-03 18:14   I by coach to the King’s house, and there saw good, part of “The Scornfull Lady,” and that done, would have taken out Knepp, but she was engaged, and so to my Lord Crew’s to visit him.

1668-06-03 10:27   I did ask the Duke of York’s leave for my going out of town five or six days, which he did give me, saying, that my diligence in the King’s business was such, that I ought not to be denied when my own business called me any whither.

1668-06-02 23:50 r Got there by twelve o’clock, taking into my boat, for company, a man that desired a passage — a certain western bargeman, with whom I had good sport, talking of the old woman of Woolwich, and telling him the whole story.

1668-06-02 22:04 r By water down to Deptford and there it being dark I did by agreement andar a la house de Bagwell; and, after a little playing and besando, we did go up in the dark a su cama and there fasero la grand cosa upon the bed; and that being hecho, did go away and to my boat again.

1668-06-02 19:52 r I to my little mercer’s Finch, that lives now in the Minories, where I have left my cloak, and did here besar su moher, a belle femme, and there took my cloak which I had left there.

1668-06-02 17:56 r And so back again, and stopped and drank at the Gun, at Mile End, and so to the Old Exchange door, and did buy them a pound of cherries, cost me 2s, and so set them down again.

1668-06-02 14:47   I took a coach, and called Mercer at their back-door, and she brought with her Mrs. Knightly, a little pretty sober girl, and I carried them to Old Ford, a town by Bow, where I never was before, and there walked in the fields very pleasant, and sang.

1668-06-02 01:28   To Mr. Mills’s, and here find, whom I saw go in, and that did make me go thither, Mrs. Hallworthy and Mrs. Andrews, and here supped, and extraordinary merry till one in the morning, Mr. Andrews coming to us: and mightily pleased with this night’s company and mirth I home to bed.

1668-06-01 19:15 r All alone to Fox Hall, and walked and saw young Newport, and two more rogues of the town, seize on two ladies, who walked with them an hour with their masks on; perhaps civil ladies; and there I left them, and so home.

1668-06-01 16:20   To White Hall, and there attended the Lords of the Treasury and a committee of Council with the Duke of York about the charge of this year’s fleet, and thence I to Westminster and to Mrs. Martin’s, and did hazer what yo would con her, and did aussi tocar la thigh de su landlady.

1668-06-01 11:48   Home, and did walk an hour in the garden with Sir W. Warren, who do tell me of the great difficulty he is under in the business of his accounts with the Commissioners of Parliament, and I fear some inconveniences and troubles may be occasioned thereby to me.

1668-06-01 08:10   Up and with Sir J. Minnes to Westminster, and in the Hall there I met with Harris and Rolt, and carried them to the Rhenish wine-house, where I have not been in a morning — nor any tavern, I think, these seven years and more.
