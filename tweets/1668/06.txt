1668-06-30 21:54   I very melancholy under the fear of my eyes being spoiled, and not to be recovered; for I am come that I am not able to read out a small letter, and yet my sight good for the little while I can read, as ever they were, I think.

1668-06-30 13:24   At the Office all the morning: then home to dinner, where a stinking leg of mutton, the weather being very wet and hot to keep meat in.

1668-06-29 22:10   With my wife to the King’s playhouse — “The Mulberry Garden,” which she had not seen. So by coach to Islington, and round by Hackney home with much pleasure, and to supper and bed.

1668-06-29 11:25   To the Chapel, it being St. Peter’s day, and did hear an anthem of Silas Taylor’s making; a dull, old-fashioned thing, that nobody could understand: and the Duke of York, when he come out, told me that he was a better store-keeper than anthem-maker, and that was bad enough, too.

1668-06-29 10:15   I find the Duke of York in the Council-chamber; where the Officers of the Navy were called in about about calling in of more ships; the King of France having, ordered his fleet to come in, notwithstanding what he had lately ordered for their staying abroad.

1668-06-29 09:20   With Sir J. Minnes toward St. James’s, and I stop at Dr. Turberville’s, and there did receive a direction for some physic, and also a glass of something to drop into my eyes: who gives me hopes that I may do well.

1668-06-28 21:40   Much talk of the French setting out their fleet afresh; but I hear nothing that our King is alarmed at it, at all, but rather making his fleet less.

1668-06-28 20:55   Deane and I all the afternoon till night to talk of navy matters and ships with great pleasure.

1668-06-28 13:50   Home to dinner, where Betty Turner, Mercer, and Captain Deane, and after dinner to sing, Mr. Pelling coming.

1668-06-27 18:45   With my wife to buy some linen, at the new shop over against the New Exchange; come out of London since the fire, who says his and other tradesmen’s retail trade is so great here, and better than it was in London, that they believe they shall not return.

1668-06-27 17:36   My wife, and Deb., and I to the King’s playhouse, and saw “The Indian Queene,” but do not doat upon Nan Marshall’s acting therein, as the world talks of her excellence therein.

1668-06-26 19:20   All the afternoon we all at Sir W. Pen’s with him about the Victuallers’ accounts, and then in the evening to Charing Cross, and there took up my wife at her tailor’s, and so home.

1668-06-25 22:03   After dinner at home to the office again, and there all the afternoon very busy till night, and then home to supper and to bed.

1668-06-25 12:03   Up, and to the office all the morning.

1668-06-24 22:32 r By water to Spring Garden, and there supped, and so home, not very merry, only when we come home, Mercer and I sat and sung in the garden a good while, and so to bed.

1668-06-24 17:14   With wife, Mercer, Deb., and W. Hewer to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there saw “The Impertinents,” a pretty good play.

1668-06-24 11:04   I by water (calling and drinking, but not besando, at Michell’s) to Westminster, but it being holyday did no business, only to Martin’s and there yo did hazer la cosa con her.

1668-06-23 21:12   I with my wife and Deb., whom I left at Unthanke’s, and so to Hercules Pillars, and there we three supped on cold powdered beef, and thence home and in the garden walked a good while with Deane, talking well of the Navy miscarriages and faults.

1668-06-23 14:54   To Westminster to Dr. Turberville about my eyes, whom I met with: and he did discourse, I thought, learnedly about them; and takes time before he did prescribe me any thing, to think of it.

1668-06-22 20:05 r Thence home, where the streets full, at our end of the town, removing their wine against the Act begins, which will be two days hence, to raise the price. I did get my store in of Batelier this night.

1668-06-22 18:10 r My business was to meet Mr. Boyle, which I did, and discoursed about my eyes; and he did give me the best advice he could, but refers me to one Turberville, of Salsbury, lately come to town, which I will go to.

1668-06-22 17:52   To my Lord Brouncker’s, where a Council of the Royall Society; and there heard Mr. Harry Howard’s noble offers about ground for our College, and his intentions of building his own house there most nobly.

1668-06-22 16:10 r Creed and I to the King’s playhouse, and saw an act or two of the new play again, but like it not. Calling this day at Herringman’s, he tells me Dryden do himself call it but a fifth-rate play.

1668-06-22 13:55   After dinner comes Creed, whom I hate, to speak with me, and before him comes Mrs. Daniel about business and yo did tocar su cosa with mi mano.

1668-06-22 11:00   To the Harp and Ball I to drink, and so to the Coffee-house in Covent Garden; but met with nobody but Sir Philip Howard, who shamed me before the whole house there, in commendation of my speech in Parliament.

1668-06-22 07:50   Up, and with Balty to St. James’s, and there presented him to Mr. Wren about his being Muster-Master this year, which will be done.

1668-06-21 15:00   Dined with my wife and Deb. alone, but merry and in good humour, which is, when all is done, the greatest felicity of all, and after dinner she to read in the “Illustre Bassa” the plot of yesterday’s play, which is most exactly the same.

1668-06-20 22:00 r So to supper, grieved for my eyes, and to bed.

1668-06-20 20:50 r I set Povy down at Charing Cross, and took my wife up, and calling at the New Exchange at Smith’s shop, and kissed her pretty hand, and so we home, and there able to do nothing by candlelight, my eyes being now constantly so bad that I must take present advice or be blind.

1668-06-20 18:24 r She to Unthanke’s and I to Mr. Povy, and there settled some business; and here talked of things, and he thinks there will be great revolutions, and that Creed will be a great man, though a rogue, he being a man of the old strain, which will now be up again.

1668-06-20 17:30   My wife and I alone to the King’s house, and there I saw this new play my wife saw yesterday, and do not like it, it being very smutty, and nothing so good as “The Maiden Queen,” or “The Indian Emperour,” of his making.

1668-06-19 18:24   Home, and by and by comes my wife and Deb. home, have been at the King’s playhouse today, thinking to spy me there; and saw the new play, “Evening Love,” of Dryden’s, which, though the world commends, she likes not.

1668-06-19 16:00   To White Hall, where we attended the Duke of York. And thence out, and did see many of the Knights of the Garter, with the King and Duke of York, going into the Privychamber to elect the Elector of Saxony into that Order, who, I did hear the Duke of York say, was a good drinker.

1668-06-19 10:50   Yesterday I heard how my Lord Ashly is like to die, having some imposthume in his breast, that he hath been fain to be cut into the body.

1668-06-19 09:25 r And I said nothing, but, with very mild words and few, suffered her humour to spend, till we begun to be very quiet, and I think all will be over, and friends, and so I to the office.

1668-06-19 09:15 r And then all come out, that I loved pleasure and denied her any, and a deal of do; and I find that there have been great fallings out between my father and her, whom, for ever hereafter, I must keep asunder, for they cannot possibly agree.

1668-06-19 09:10   Rose, and then my wife fell into her blubbering again, and at length had a request to make to me, which was, that she might go into France, and live there, out of trouble.

1668-06-19 03:30 r So homeward, and stopped at Mr. Mills’s, where he and she at the door, and Mrs. Turner, and Betty, and Mrs. Hollworthy, and there I stayed and talked, and up to the church leads, and saw the fire, which spent itself, till all fear over.

1668-06-19 02:50 r I found it in a new-built house that stood alone in Minchin-lane, over against the Cloth-workers’-hall, which burned furiously: the house not yet quite finished.

1668-06-19 02:35 r So we all rose; and my care presently was to secure my gold, and plate, and papers, and could quickly have done it, but I went forth to see where it was; and the whole town was presently in the streets.

1668-06-19 02:30   We were waked with my maids crying out, “Fire, fire, in Marke lane!” So I rose and looked out, and it was dreadful; and strange apprehensions in me, and us all, of being presently burnt.

1668-06-19 01:45 r By and by she comes back to me, and still crying; I then rose, and would have sat up all night, but she would have me come to bed again; and being pretty well pacified, we to sleep.

1668-06-19 01:10 r To bed; and my wife troubled all night, and about one o’clock goes out of the bed to the girl’s bed, which did trouble me, she crying and sobbing, without telling the cause.

1668-06-18 21:20   Home, where supped Mr. Turner and his wife, and Betty and Mercer and Pelling, as merry as the ill, melancholy humour that my wife was in, would let us, which vexed me; but I took no notice of it, thinking that will be the best way, and let it wear away itself.

1668-06-18 15:41   Met with Povy, who tells me how hard Creed is upon him, though he did give him, about six months since, I think he said, fifty pieces in gold; and one thing there is in his accounts that I fear may touch me, but I shall help it, I hope.

1668-06-18 12:20   My wife still in a melancholy, fusty humour, and crying, and do not tell me what it is; but I by little words find that she hath heard of my going to plays, and carrying people abroad in her absence; and that I cannot help but the storm will break out, I think, in a little time.

1668-06-18 11:58 r I did receive a hint or two from my Lord Anglesey, as if he thought much of my taking the ayre as I have done; but I care not a turd; but whatever the matter is, I think he hath some ill-will to me.

1668-06-18 11:54   Up betimes and to the office, there to set my papers in order and books, my office having been new whited and windows made clean, and so to sit, where all the morning.

1668-06-17 21:27 r By and by home, and there with my people to supper, all in pretty good humour, though I find my wife hath something in her gizzard, that only waits an opportunity of being provoked to bring up; but I will not, for my content-sake, give it.

1668-06-17 19:39 r Thence pleasant way to London, before night, and find all very well, to great content; and there to talk with my wife, and saw Sir W. Pen, who is well again. I hear of the ill news by the great fire at Barbados.

1668-06-17 18:15 r Somewhat out of humour all day, reflecting on my wife’s neglect of things, and impertinent humour got by this liberty of being from me, which she is never to be trusted with; for she is a fool.

1668-06-17 13:27   Set out with one coach in company, and through Maydenhead, which I never saw before, to Colebrooke; the way mighty good; and there dined, and fitted ourselves a little to go through London, anon.

1668-06-16 21:50 r W. Hewer troubled with the headake we had none of his company last night, nor all this day nor night to talk.

1668-06-16 20:11 r Come to Reading, and then to supper, and then I to walk about the town, which is a great one, I think bigger than Salsbury: a river runs through it, in seven branches, and unite in one, in one part of the town, and runs into the Thames half-a-mile off.

1668-06-16 14:20 r Come to Newbery, and there dined, and music, which a song of the old courtier of Queen Elizabeth’s, and how he was changed upon the coming in of the King, did please me mightily, and I did cause W. Hewer to write it out.

1668-06-16 11:15   Passing through a good part of this county of Wiltshire, saw a good house of Alexander Popham’s, and another of my Lord Craven’s, I think in Barkeshire.

1668-06-15 21:40 r My wife pleased with all, this evening reading of “Mustapha” to me till supper, and then to supper, and had music whose innocence pleased me, and I did give them 3s.

1668-06-15 20:33 r Come to Marlborough, and lay at the Hart; a good house, and a pretty fair town for a street or two; and what is most singular is, their houses on one side having their pent-houses supported with pillars, which makes it a good walk.

1668-06-15 17:50 r About a mile off, it was prodigious to see how full the Downes are of great stones; and all along the vallies, stones of considerable bigness, most of them growing certainly out of the ground so thick as to cover the ground which makes me think the less of the wonder of Stonage.

1668-06-15 17:40 r So took coach again, seeing one place with great high stones pitched round, which, I believe, was once some particular building, in some measure like that of Stonage.

1668-06-15 17:00 r Come to Abebury, where, seeing great stones like those of Stonage standing up, I stopped and took a countryman of that town, and he carried me and showed me a place trenched in, with great stones pitched in it, some bigger than those at Stonage in figure, to my great admiration.

1668-06-15 16:20 r Took coach, and away, without any of the company of the other stage-coaches, that go out of this town to-day; and rode all day with some trouble, for fear of being out of our way, over the Downes, where the life of the shepherds is, in fair weather only, pretty.

1668-06-15 06:30   Up, and with Mr. Butts to look into the baths, and find the King and Queen’s full of a mixed sort, of good and bad, and the Cross only almost for the gentry.

1668-06-14 21:03 r To supper, and then comes my landlord to me, a sober understanding man, and did give me a good account of the antiquity of this town and Wells; and of two Heads, on two pillars, in Wells church. But he a Catholick.

1668-06-14 16:45 r Took my wife out and the girls, and come to this church again, to see it, and look over the monuments, where, among others, Dr. Venner and Pelling, and a lady of Sir W. Waller’s; he lying with his face broken.

1668-06-14 14:56 r So home to dinner, and after dinner comes Mr. Butts again to see me, and he and I to church, where the same idle fellow preached; and I slept most of the sermon.

1668-06-14 10:22 r Here a good organ; but a vain, pragmatical fellow preached a ridiculous, affected sermon, that made me angry, and some gentlemen that sat next me, and sang well.

1668-06-14 09:30 r And so to the great Church, and there saw Bishop Montagu’s tomb; and, when placed, did there see many brave people come, and, among others, two men brought in, in litters, and set down in the chancel to hear: but I did not know one face.

1668-06-14 08:20   Up, and walked up and down the town, and saw a pretty good market-place, and many good streets, and very fair stone-houses.

1668-06-13 22:10 r We back, and by moonshine to the Bath again, about ten-o’clock: bad way; and giving the coachman 1s. went all of us to bed.

1668-06-13 18:22 r Comes in another poor woman, who, hearing that Deb. was here, did come running hither, and with her eyes so full of tears, and heart so full of joy, that she could not speak when she come in, that it made me weep too.

1668-06-13 17:40 r And so brought us a back way by surprize to his house, where a substantial good house, and well furnished; and did give us good entertainment of strawberries, a whole venison-pasty, cold, and plenty of brave wine, and above all Bristoll milk.

1668-06-13 16:20 r He showed me the Custom-house, and led us through Marsh Street, where our girl was born. But, Lord! the joy that was among the old poor people of the place, to see Mrs. Willet’s daughter, it seems her mother being a brave woman and mightily beloved!

1668-06-13 15:30 r Walked back to the Sun, where I find Deb. come back, and with her, her uncle, a sober merchant, very good company, and so like one of our sober, wealthy, London merchants, as pleased me mightily.

1668-06-13 15:05 r And so went to the Sun; and there Deb. going with W. Hewer and Betty Turner to see her uncle, and leaving my wife with the mistress of the house, I to see the quay, which is a most large and noble place; and to see the new ship building by Baily. It will be a fine ship.

1668-06-13 14:50 r No carts, it standing generally on vaults, only dog-carts. So to the Three Crowns Tavern I was directed; but, when I come in, the master told me that he had newly given over the selling of wine; it seems, grown rich.

1668-06-13 14:45 r Set out towards Bristoll, and come thither, where set down at the Horseshoe, and there, being trimmed by a very handsome fellow, walked with my wife and people through the city, which is in every respect another London, that one can hardly know it.

1668-06-13 08:20 r Carried away, wrapped in a sheet, and in a chair, home; and there one after another thus carried, I staying above two hours in the water, home to bed, sweating for an hour; and by and by, comes music to play to me, extraordinary good as ever I heard at London almost.

1668-06-13 06:15 r But strange to see, when women and men herein, that live all the season in these waters, that cannot but be parboiled, and look like the creatures of the bath!

1668-06-13 06:10 r Good conversation among them that are acquainted here, and stay together. Strange to see how hot the water is; and in some places, though this is the most temperate bath, the springs so hot as the feet not able to endure.

1668-06-13 05:40 r And by and by, though we designed to have done before company come, much company come; very fine ladies; and the manner pretty enough, only methinks it cannot be clean to go so many bodies together in the same water.

1668-06-13 04:34   Up at four o’clock, being by appointment called up to the Cross Bath, where we were carried one after one another, myself, and wife, and Betty Turner, Willet, and W. Hewer.

1668-06-12 19:04 r We come before night to the Bath; where I presently stepped out with my landlord, and saw the baths, with people in them. They are not so large as I expected, but yet pleasant; and the town most of stone, and clean, though the streets generally narrow.

1668-06-12 12:10 r At Philips-Norton I walked to the Church, and saw a very ancient tomb of some Knight Templar; and saw the tombstone whereon there were only two heads cut, which were two sisters, called the Fair Maids of Foscott, that had two bodies upward and one belly, and there lie buried.

1668-06-12 10:15 r The first town we came to was Brekington, where, we stopping for something for the horses, we called two or three little boys to us, and pleased ourselves with their manner of speech, and did make one of them kiss Deb, and another say the Lord’s Prayer.

1668-06-12 10:00 r So rode a very good way, led to my great content by our landlord to Philips-Norton, with great pleasure, being now come into Somersetshire; where my wife and Deb. mightily joyed thereat, I commending the country, as indeed it deserves.

1668-06-12 07:20   Up, finding our beds good, but lousy; which made us merry. We set out, the reckoning and servants coming to 9s. 6d.

1668-06-11 23:20 r This day from Salisbury I wrote by the post my excuse for not coming home, which I hope will do, for I am resolved to see the Bath, and, it may be, Bristol.

1668-06-11 23:15 r We were fain to go into a room where a pedlar was in bed, and made him rise; and there wife and I lay, and in a truckle-bed Betty Turner and Willett.

1668-06-11 22:50 r And there with great difficulty come about ten at night to a little inn. The master of the house a sober, understanding man, and I had good discourse with him about this country’s matters, as wool, and corne, and other things.

1668-06-11 21:20 r With a guide went over the smooth Plain indeed till night; and then by a happy mistake, and that looked like an adventure, we were carried out of our way to a town where we would lie, since we could not go so far as we would.

1668-06-11 13:32 r So back home; and there being ’light, we to the Church, and there find them at prayers again, so could not see the Quire; but I sent the women home, and I did go in, and saw very many fine tombs, and among the rest some very ancient, of the Montagus.

1668-06-11 11:40 r The three women behind W. Hewer, Murford, and our guide, and I single to Stonage; over the Plain and some great hills, even to fright us. Come thither, and find them as prodigious as any tales I heard of them, and worth going this journey to see. God knows what their use was!

1668-06-11 10:02 r Thence to the inne; and there not being able to hire coach-horses, and not willing to use our own, we got saddle-horses, very dear.

1668-06-11 09:27 r So to my lodging back, and took out my wife and people to show them the town and Church; but they being at prayers, we could not be shown the Quire. A very good organ; and I looked in, and saw the Bishop, my friend Dr. Ward.

1668-06-11 08:30 r But the Minster most admirable; as big, I think, and handsomer than Westminster: and a most large Close about it, and houses for the Officers thereof, and a fine palace for the Bishop.

1668-06-11 08:10 r Up, and W. Hewer and I up and down the town, and find it a very brave place. The river goes through every street; and a most capacious market-place. The city great, I think greater than Hereford.

1668-06-10 23:43 r Come to the George Inne, where lay in a silk bed; and very good diet. To supper; then to bed.

1668-06-10 22:03 r So all over the Plain by the sight of the steeple, the Plain high and low, to Salisbury; but before I come to the town, I saw a great fortification, and there ’light, and find it prodigious, so as to frighten me to be in it all alone, it being dark.

1668-06-10 14:12 r So come to Hungerford, where very good trouts, eels, and crayfish. A mean town.

1668-06-10 10:10 r So forth towards Hungerford, led this good way by our landlord, one Heart, an old but very civil and well-spoken man, more than I ever heard, of his quality. He gone, we forward; and I vexed at my people’s not minding the way.

1668-06-10 09:40 r So did give the poor, which they would not take but in their box, 2s. 6d. So to the inn, and paid the reckoning and what not, 13s.

1668-06-10 08:10   Up, and walked to the Hospitall: very large and fine; and pictures of founders, and the History of the Hospitall; and is said to be worth; 700l. per annum.

1668-06-09 21:20 r At night come to Abingdon, where had been a fair of custard; and met many people and scholars going home; and there did get some pretty good musick, and sang and danced till supper.

1668-06-09 19:04 r Oxford mighty fine place; and well seated, and cheap entertainment.

1668-06-09 18:12 r Thence with coach and people to Physic-garden. So to Friar Bacon’s study: I up and saw it, and give the man 1s. Bottle of sack for landlord.

1668-06-09 16:28 r After come home from the schools, I out with the landlord to Brazen-nose College; — to the butteries, and in the cellar find the hand of the Child of Hales.

1668-06-09 14:37   To Oxford, a very sweet place. To dinner; and then out with my wife and people, and landlord. And to him that showed us the schools and library, 10s. To him that showed us All Souls’ College, and Chichly’s picture, 5s.

1668-06-08 21:32 r To Newport Pagnell; and there a good pleasant country-town, but few people in it. A very fair — and like a Cathedral — Church; and I saw the leads, and a vault that goes far under ground.

1668-06-08 15:00 r So to Buckingham, a good old town. Here I to see the Church, which very good, and the leads, and a school in it. A fair bridge here, with many arches: vexed at my people’s making me lose so much time.

1668-06-08 11:30   Pleasant country to Bedford, where, while they stay, I rode through the town; and a good country-town.

1668-06-07 22:23   My father, for money lent, and horse-hire, 1l. 11s.

1668-06-06 22:20   Spent at Huntingdon with Bowles, and Appleyard, and Shepley, 2s.

1668-06-05 22:30   At Barnet, for milk, 6d. On the highway, to menders of the highway, 6d. Dinner at Stevenage, 5s. 6d.

1668-06-04 22:23   All the evening to set matters in order against my going to Brampton tomorrow, being resolved upon my journey, and having the Duke of York’s leave again today; though I do plainly see that I can very ill be spared now, there being much business.

1668-06-04 14:10   I carried and set Mr. Clerke, the solicitor, down at the Temple, he observing to me how St. Sepulchre’s church steeple is repaired already a good deal, and the Fleet Bridge is contracted for by the City to begin to be built this summer, which do please me mightily.

1668-06-03 22:10   So to the lodge, and drank a cup of new milk, and so home, and there to Mrs. Turner’s, and sat and talked with her, and then home to bed, having laid my business with W. Hewer to go out of town, with hopes of a great deal of pleasure.

1668-06-03 19:38   By coach to Westminster to the Hall, and thence to the Park, where much good company, and many fine ladies; and in so handsome a hackney I was, that I believe Sir W. Coventry and others, who looked on me, did take me to be in one of my own, which I was a little troubled for.

1668-06-03 18:14   I by coach to the King’s house, and there saw good, part of “The Scornfull Lady,” and that done, would have taken out Knepp, but she was engaged, and so to my Lord Crew’s to visit him.

1668-06-03 10:27   I did ask the Duke of York’s leave for my going out of town five or six days, which he did give me, saying, that my diligence in the King’s business was such, that I ought not to be denied when my own business called me any whither.

1668-06-02 23:50 r Got there by twelve o’clock, taking into my boat, for company, a man that desired a passage — a certain western bargeman, with whom I had good sport, talking of the old woman of Woolwich, and telling him the whole story.

1668-06-02 22:04 r By water down to Deptford and there it being dark I did by agreement andar a la house de Bagwell; and, after a little playing and besando, we did go up in the dark a su cama and there fasero la grand cosa upon the bed; and that being hecho, did go away and to my boat again.

1668-06-02 19:52 r I to my little mercer’s Finch, that lives now in the Minories, where I have left my cloak, and did here besar su moher, a belle femme, and there took my cloak which I had left there.

1668-06-02 17:56 r And so back again, and stopped and drank at the Gun, at Mile End, and so to the Old Exchange door, and did buy them a pound of cherries, cost me 2s, and so set them down again.

1668-06-02 14:47   I took a coach, and called Mercer at their back-door, and she brought with her Mrs. Knightly, a little pretty sober girl, and I carried them to Old Ford, a town by Bow, where I never was before, and there walked in the fields very pleasant, and sang.

1668-06-02 01:28   To Mr. Mills’s, and here find, whom I saw go in, and that did make me go thither, Mrs. Hallworthy and Mrs. Andrews, and here supped, and extraordinary merry till one in the morning, Mr. Andrews coming to us: and mightily pleased with this night’s company and mirth I home to bed.

1668-06-01 19:15 r All alone to Fox Hall, and walked and saw young Newport, and two more rogues of the town, seize on two ladies, who walked with them an hour with their masks on; perhaps civil ladies; and there I left them, and so home.

1668-06-01 16:20   To White Hall, and there attended the Lords of the Treasury and a committee of Council with the Duke of York about the charge of this year’s fleet, and thence I to Westminster and to Mrs. Martin’s, and did hazer what yo would con her, and did aussi tocar la thigh de su landlady.

1668-06-01 11:48   Home, and did walk an hour in the garden with Sir W. Warren, who do tell me of the great difficulty he is under in the business of his accounts with the Commissioners of Parliament, and I fear some inconveniences and troubles may be occasioned thereby to me.

1668-06-01 08:10   Up and with Sir J. Minnes to Westminster, and in the Hall there I met with Harris and Rolt, and carried them to the Rhenish wine-house, where I have not been in a morning — nor any tavern, I think, these seven years and more.
