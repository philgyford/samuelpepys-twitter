1668-03-08 13:59 r Though, when all is done, he is a shirke, who owns his owing me 10l. for his lady two or three years ago, and yet cannot provide to pay me.

1668-03-08 13:56 r I up with her husband, Sir Philip Carteret, to his closet, where, beyond expectation, I do find many pretty things, wherein he appears to be ingenious, such as in painting, and drawing, and making of watches, and such kind of things, above my expectation.

1668-03-08 13:03 r Here my Lady Jem. do promise to come, and bring my Lord Hinchingbroke and his lady some day this week, to dinner to me, which I am glad of.

1668-03-08 12:30   I to dinner with Sir G. Carteret to Lincoln’s Inn Fields, where I find mighty deal of company — a solemn day for some of his and her friends, and dine in the great dining-room above stairs, where Sir G. Carteret himself, and I, and his son, at a little table by.

1668-03-08 09:10   Sir J. Robinson, Lieutenant of the Tower, did call me with his coach, and carried me to White Hall, where met with very many people still that did congratulate my speech the other day in the House of Commons, and I find all the world almost rings of it.

1668-03-07 22:15   To the office, where I wrote what I had to write, and among others to my father to congratulate my sister’s marriage, and so home to supper a little and then to bed.

1668-03-07 17:20 r A very silly play, only great variety of dances, and those most excellently done, especially one part by one Hanes, only lately come thither from the Nursery, an understanding fellow, but yet, they say, hath spent 1000l. a-year before he come thither.

1668-03-07 14:04   Home to dinner, where Mercer with us, and after dinner she, my wife, Deb., and I, to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Spanish Gipsys,” the second time of acting, and the first that I saw it.

1668-03-06 22:07 r With the Lieutenant of the Tower, in his coach home; and there, with great pleasure, with my wife, talking and playing at cards a little — she, and I, and W. Hewer, and Deb., and so, after a little supper, I to bed.

1668-03-06 13:27 r My Lord Gerard, who never knew me before nor spoke to me, desires his being better acquainted with me; and that, at table where he was, he never heard so much said of any man as of me, in his whole life.

1668-03-06 11:42 r Mr. Vaughan did protest that he had sat 26 years in Parliament and never heard such a speech there before: for which the Lord God make me thankful! and that I may make use of it not to pride and vainglory, but that, now I have this esteem, I may do nothing that may lessen it!

1668-03-06 11:00 r Every body that saw me come to me with such eulogys as cannot be expressed. I met Mr. G. Montagu who kissed me and told me that he had often heretofore kissed my hands but now he would kiss my lips: protesting that I was another Cicero and said all the world said the same of me.

1668-03-06 10:08 r My Lord Barkeley did cry me up for what they had heard of it; and others, Parliament-men there, about the King, did say that they never heard such a speech in their lives delivered in that manner.

1668-03-06 09:32 r And, by and by, overtaking the King, the King and Duke of York come to me both; and he said, “Mr. Pepys, I am very glad of your success yesterday;” and fell to talk of my well speaking.

1668-03-06 09:10 r I to the Duke of York’s lodgings, and find him going to the Park, it being a very fine morning, and I after him; and he told me, with great satisfaction, that I had converted a great many yesterday, and did, with great praise of me, go on with the discourse with me.

1668-03-06 08:15 r He said that his brother admires me; and another gentleman said that I could not get less than 1000l. a-year if I would put on a gown and plead at the Chancery-bar; but, what pleases me most, the Sollicitor-Generall did protest that I spoke the best of any man in England.

1668-03-06 07:50   With Sir D. Gawden to Sir W. Coventry’s chamber: where the first word he said to me was, “Good-morrow, Mr. Pepys, that must be Speaker of the Parliament-house” and did protest I had got honour for ever in Parliament.

1668-03-05 21:00 r Home with W. Pen, and there to my wife, whom W. Hewer had told of my success, and she overjoyed, and I also as to my particular; and, after talking awhile, I betimes to bed, having had no quiet rest a good while.

1668-03-05 16:10 r However, it is plain we have got great ground; and everybody says I have got the most honour that any could have had opportunity of getting; and so with our hearts mightily overjoyed at this success, we all to dinner to Lord Brouncker’s.

1668-03-05 15:55 r But my speech, being so long, many had gone out to dinner and come in again half drunk; and then there are two or three that are professed enemies to us and every body else, these did rise up and speak against the coming to a vote now, the House not being full.

1668-03-05 15:45 r We were called in again by and by to answer only one question, touching our paying tickets to ticket-mongers; and so out; and we were in hopes to have had a vote this day in our favour, and so the generality of the House was.

1668-03-05 15:32 r All my Fellow-Officers, and all the world that was within hearing, did congratulate me, and cry up my speech as the best thing they ever heard; and my Fellow-Officers overjoyed in it.

1668-03-05 15:10 r I continued at it without any hesitation or losse, but with full scope, and all my reason free about me, as if it had been at my own table, from that time till past three in the afternoon; and so ended, without any interruption from the Speaker; but we withdrew.

1668-03-05 12:50 r I perceive the whole House was full, and full of expectation of our defence what it would be, and with great prejudice. After the Speaker had told us the dissatisfaction of the House, and read the Report of the Committee, I began our defence most acceptably and smoothly.

1668-03-05 11:24 r So we all up to the lobby; and between eleven and twelve o’clock, were called in, with the mace before us, into the House, where a mighty full House; and we stood at the bar, namely, Brouncker, Sir J. Minnes, Sir T. Harvey, and myself, W. Pen being in the House, as a Member.

1668-03-05 10:32 r I full of thoughts and trouble touching the issue of this day; and, to comfort myself, did go to the Dog and drink half-a-pint of mulled sack, and in the Hall did drink a dram of brandy; and with the warmth of this did find myself in better order as to courage, truly.

1668-03-05 09:00 r I did go down to the Old Swan, and there by boat, with T. Hater and W. Hewer with me, to Westminster, where I found myself come time enough, and my brethren all ready.

1668-03-05 07:30 r So with great trouble, but yet with some ease, from this discourse with my wife, I up, and to my Office, whither come my clerks, and so I did huddle the best I could some more notes for my discourse today.

1668-03-05 06:30 r With these thoughts I lay troubling myself, restless, and at last getting my wife to talk to me to comfort me, which she at last did, and made me resolve to quit my hands of this Office, and endure the trouble of it no longer than till I can clear myself of it.

1668-03-05 04:10 r Slept about three hours, but then waked, and never in so much trouble in all my life of mind, thinking of the task I have upon me, and upon what dissatisfactory grounds, and what the issue of it may be to me.

1668-03-04 22:10 r Quite weary, and dull, and vexed, I could go no further, but resolved to leave the rest to tomorrow morning, and so in full discontent and weariness did give over and went home, without supper vexed and sickish to bed.

1668-03-04 20:23 r Only with room for a little dinner, we very busy all the day till night that the officers met for me to give them the heads of what I intended to say, which I did with great discontent to see them all rely on me that have no reason at all to trouble myself about it.

1668-03-04 09:23   It being a cold wet day, I home with Sir J. Minnes in his coach, and called by the way at my bookseller’s and took home with me Kercher’s Musurgia — very well bound, but I had no comfort to look upon them, but as soon as I come home fell to my work at the office.

1668-03-03 23:57   I home and there to my chamber with Mr. Gibson, and late up till midnight preparing more things against our defence to my content, though vexed that all this trouble should be on me.

1668-03-03 15:10   Down by water to Deptford, where the King, Queene, and Court are to see launched the new ship built by Mr. Shish, called “The Charles.” God send her better luck than the former!

1668-03-03 08:20   Up betimes to work again, where to our great business of this answer to the Parliament; where to my great vexation I find my Lord Brouncker prepared only to excuse himself, while I, that have least reason to trouble myself, am preparing with great pains to defend them all.

1668-03-03 01:50   Home, and there I settle to business, and with my people preparing my great answer to the Parliament for the office about tickets till past 1 a o’clock at night, and then home to supper and to bed, keeping Mr. Gibson with me.

1668-03-02 17:13   With my wife and the girl to the King’s house to see the “Virgin Martyr” again, which do please me, but above all the musique at the coming down of the angel, which at this hearing the second time, do still commend me as nothing ever did, and the other music is nothing to it.

1668-03-02 10:44   W. Hewer tells me that the Officers of the Navy shall be all turned out, but honest Sir John Minnes, who, God knows, is fitter to have been turned out himself than any of us, doing the King more hurt by his dotage and folly than all the rest can do by their knavery.

1668-03-01 22:00   So without supper to bed, my eyes being also a little overwrought of late that I could not stay up to read.

1668-03-01 16:03 r To Mrs. Martin’s, and with great difficulty, company being there, did get an opportunity to hazer what I would con her, and here I was mightily taken with a starling which she hath, that was the King’s, which do whistle and talk the best that ever I heard anything in my life.

1668-03-01 14:33   To St. Margaret’s church, thinking to have seen Betty Michell, but she was not there, but met her father and mother and with them to her father’s house, where I never was before, but was mighty much made of, with some good strong waters, which they have from their son Michell.

1668-03-01 11:42   In lieu of a coach this year, I have got my wife to be contented with her closet being made up this summer, and going into the country for a month or two, to my father’s, and there Mercer and Deb. and Jane shall go with her, which I the rather do for the entertaining my wife.

1668-03-01 10:20 r We did here do the like about the complaint of want of victuals in the fleet in the year 1666, which will lie upon me to defend also. So that my head is full of care and weariness in my employment.

1668-03-01 08:50   Up very betimes, and by coach to Sir W. Coventry’s; and there, carrying with me all papers, did run over our whole defence in the business of tickets, in order to the answering the House; and I do think, unless they be set without reason to ruin us, we shall make a good defence.
