1668-03-17 20:10   The House, I hear, have this day concluded upon raising 100,000l. of the 300,000l. by wine, and the rest by a poll, and have resolved to excuse the Church, in expectation that they will do the more of themselves at this juncture.

1668-03-17 16:30   I stopped at the ’Change, and there bought several things for my wife, and so to my bookseller’s, and there looked for Montaigne’s Essays, which I heard by my Lord Arlington and Lord Blaney so much commended, and intend to buy it, but did not now.

1668-03-17 14:12 r Above all, he do curse my Lord of Bristoll, saying the worst news that the Devil could ever bring us was this Lord’s coming to prayers the other day in the House of Lords, by which he is coming about again from being a Papist, which will undo this nation.

1668-03-17 14:04   I fell in talk with Mr. Ball, who, being an old cavalier, do swear and curse at the present state of things, that we should be brought to this, that we must be undone and cannot be saved.

1668-03-16 22:14   After a little at the office I home, and there spent the evening with my wife talking and singing, and so to bed with my mind pretty well at ease.

1668-03-16 19:30   W. Pen and Sir R. Ford and I met at the first’s house to talk of our prize that is now at last come safe over from Holland, by which I hope to receive some if not all the benefit of my bargain with W. Batten for my share in it.

1668-03-16 13:50   I with Sir W. Pen home, and there to dinner, where I find, by Willet’s crying, that her mistress had been angry with her: but I would take no notice of it.

1668-03-16 12:04   In the Hall, did walk all the morning, talking with one or other, expecting to have our business in the House; but did now a third time wait to no purpose, they being all this morning upon the business of Barker’s petition about the making void the Act of Settlement in Ireland.

1668-03-15 19:42 r Even after I knew that it was not board, but only the picture of a board, I could not remove my fancy.

1668-03-15 19:30   Mightily pleased with a picture that W. Hewer brought hither of several things painted upon a deal board, which board is so well painted that I never was so well pleased with any picture, and so troubled that so good pictures should be painted upon a piece of bad deale.

1668-03-15 14:20 r Good discourse of Spain, Mr. Godolphin being there; particularly of the removal of the bodies of all the dead Kings of Spain that could be got together, and brought to the Pantheon at the Escuriall, when it was finished, and there placed before the altar, there to lie for ever.

1668-03-15 13:55   Sir Thomas Clifford, the Comptroller, took me with him to dinner to his lodgings, where my Lord Arlington and a great deal of good and great company; where I very civilly used by them, and had a most excellent dinner.

1668-03-15 08:48   Up and walked, it being fine dry weather, to Sir W. Coventry’s, overtaking my boy Ely (that was), and he walked with me, being grown a man, and I think a sober fellow.

1668-03-14 22:03   My wife and I abroad by coach into Moorefields, only for a little ayre, and so home again, staying nowhere, and then up to her chamber, there to talk with pleasure of this day’s passages, and so to bed.

1668-03-14 15:28 r My Lady Hinchingbroke I find a very sweet-natured and well-disposed lady, a lover of books and pictures, and of good understanding.

1668-03-14 14:57 r Most of our discourse was of my Lord Sandwich and his family, as being all of us of the family; and with extraordinary pleasure all the afternoon, thus together eating and looking over my closet.

1668-03-14 14:20 r And there, among other things, my Lord had Sir Samuel Morland’s late invention for casting up of sums of 0l. 0s. 0d.; which is very pretty, but not very useful.

1668-03-14 13:55   Anon comes my company, viz, my Lord Hinchingbroke and his lady, Sir Philip Carteret and his lady, Godolphin and my cozen Roger, and Creed: and mighty merry; and by and by to dinner, which was very good and plentifull.

1668-03-14 10:20   After having spoke with Mr. Godolphin and cozen Roger, I away home, and there do find everything in mighty good order, only my wife not dressed, which troubles me.

1668-03-14 08:46   To Westminster Hall, and there met my Lord Brouncker, who tells me that our business is put off, and so I was mighty glad that I was eased of my attendance here, and of any occasion that might put me out of humour, as it is likely if we had been called before the Parliament.

1668-03-14 07:00   Up very betimes, and with Jane to Levett’s, there to conclude upon our dinner; and thence to the pewterer’s, to buy a pewter sesterne, which I have ever hitherto been without, and so up and down upon several occasions to set matters in order

1668-03-13 19:55 r We to Philips’s, and his man directed us to Mr. Levett’s, who could not come, and he sent to two more, and they could not; so that, at last, Levett as a great kindness did resolve he would leave his business and come himself, which set me in great ease in my mind.

1668-03-13 18:15 r But after we had found him, he could not come, nor was Mr. Gentleman in town, whom next I would have had, nor would Mrs. Stone let her man Lewis come, whom this man recommended to me; so that I was at a mighty loss what in the world to do for a cooke, Philips being out of town.

1668-03-13 17:52 r I to Mrs. Turner, and did get her to go along with me to the French pewterer’s, and there did buy some new pewter against tomorrow; and thence to White Hall, to have got a cook of her acquaintance, the best in England, as she says.

1668-03-13 16:42 r I find my wife upon the bed not over well, her breast being broke out with heat, which troubles her, but I hope it will be for her good.

1668-03-13 16:35 r Home, and there find one laying of my napkins against tomorrow in figures of all sorts, which is mighty pretty; and, it seems, it is his trade, and he gets much money by it; which is mighty pretty, and a trade I could not have thought of.

1668-03-13 15:57 r My Lady Hinchingbroke I cannot say is a beauty, nor ugly; but is altogether a comely lady enough, and seems very good-humoured, and I mighty glad of the occasion of seeing her before tomorrow.

1668-03-13 15:55   I to my Lord Crew’s, there to invite Sir Thomas Crew; and there met with my Lord Hinchingbroke and his lady, the first time I spoke to her. I saluted her; and she mighty civil and; with my Lady Jemimah, do all resolve to be very merry tomorrow at my house.

1668-03-13 14:50   To White Hall to the Duke of York, and there did our usual business, complaining of our standing still in every-respect for want of money, but no remedy propounded, but so I must still be.

1668-03-13 13:40   I to the Hall, where my Lord Brouncker and the rest waiting and not called for, and all of us to Chatelin’s, the French house in Covent Garden, and there had a damned base dinner, which did not please us at all, so that I am not fond of this house at all but do choose the Beare.

1668-03-13 07:15   Up betimes to my office, where to fit myself for attending the Parliament again, not to make any more speech, which, while my fame is good, I will avoid, for fear of losing it; but only to answer to what objections will be made against us.

1668-03-12 20:12   Home to supper, and to talk with Mr. Pelling, who tells me what a fame I have in the City for my late performance; and upon the whole I bless God for it. I think I have, if I can keep it, done myself a great deal of repute.

1668-03-12 17:12 r Here I heard Sir Robert Southwell give an account of some things committed to him by the Society at his going to Portugall, which he did deliver in a mighty handsome manner.

1668-03-12 16:40 r Here I saw a great trial of the goodness of a burning glass, made of a new figure, not spherical, that did burn a glove of my Lord Brouncker’s from the heat of a very little fire, which a burning glass of the old form, or much bigger, could not do, which was mighty pretty.

1668-03-12 15:30   I took my wife up and left her at the ’Change while I to Gresham College, there to shew myself; and was there greeted by Dr. Wilkins, Whistler, and others, as the patron of the Navy Office, and one that got great fame by my late speech to the Parliament.

1668-03-11 17:06 r This man knew me, which I would have willingly avoided, so much pride I had, he being a man of mighty height and authority in his time, but now signifies nothing.

1668-03-11 17:04 r I carried cozen Roger as far as the Strand, where, spying out of the coach Colonel Charles George Cocke, formerly a very great man, and my father’s customer, whom I have carried clothes to, but now walks like a poor sorry sneake, he stopped, and I ’light to him.

1668-03-11 15:58   I met with my cozen Roger Pepys, who hath been told of my performance before the House and is mighty proud of it, and Captain Cocke met me and told me that the Speaker says he never heard such a defence made; and that the Sollicitor-Generall do commend me even to envy.

1668-03-11 14:04 r A very fine house, and a man that lives in great fashion, with all things in a most extraordinary manner noble and rich about him, and eats in the French fashion all; and nobly served with his servants, and very civilly; that I was mighty pleased with it: and good discourse.

1668-03-11 12:50   To Westminster; and there walked, till by and by comes Sir W. Coventry, and with him Mr. Chichly and Mr. Andrew Newport, I to dinner with them to Mr. Chichly’s, in Queene Street, in Covent Garden.

1668-03-11 08:25   Up, and betimes to the office, where busy till 8 o’clock, and then went forth, and meeting Mr. Colvill, I walked with him to his building, where he is building a fine house, where he formerly lived, in Lumbard Street: and it will be a very fine street.

1668-03-10 22:54 r But I was mightily pleased with his singing; for the rogue hath a very good eare, and a good voice. Here he stayed till he was almost drunk, and then away at about ten at night, and then all broke up, and I to bed.

1668-03-10 20:40   I up to supper, where I find W. Joyce and Harman come to see us, and there was also Mrs. Mercer and her two daughters, and here we were as merry as that fellow Joyce could make us with his mad talking, after the old wont, which tired me.

1668-03-10 17:42   By coach to Lincoln’s Inn Fields; but my Lady was not come in, and so I am at a great loss whether she and her brother Hinchingbroke and sister will dine with me to-morrow or no, which vexes me.

1668-03-10 16:04   With Sir D. Gawden to Westminster Hall, thinking to have attended the Committee about the Victualling business, but they did not meet, but here we met Sir R. Brookes, who do mightily cry up my speech the other day, saying my fellow-officers are obliged to me, as indeed they are.

1668-03-10 13:50   After dinner comes Kate Joyce, who tells me she is putting off her house, which I am glad of, but it was pleasant that she come on purpose to me about getting a ticket paid, and in her way hither lost her ticket, so that she is at a great loss what to do.

1668-03-09 22:20   Home late to supper and to bed, being eased of a great many thoughts, and yet have a great many more to remove as fast as I can, my mind being burdened with them, having been so much employed upon the public business of the office in their defence before the Parliament of late.

1668-03-09 09:40 r I also met Colvill, the goldsmith, who tells me how the world upon the ’Change talks of me; and how several Parliamentmen, viz, Boscawen and Major Walden, do say how bravely I did speak, and that the House was ready to have given me thanks for it; but that, I think, is a vanity.

1668-03-09 09:02   With Sir W. Warren, who come to speak with me, by coach to White Hall, and there met Lord Brouncker: and he and I to the Commissioners of the Treasury, where I find them mighty kind to me, more, I think, than was wont.

1668-03-08 13:59 r Though, when all is done, he is a shirke, who owns his owing me 10l. for his lady two or three years ago, and yet cannot provide to pay me.

1668-03-08 13:56 r I up with her husband, Sir Philip Carteret, to his closet, where, beyond expectation, I do find many pretty things, wherein he appears to be ingenious, such as in painting, and drawing, and making of watches, and such kind of things, above my expectation.

1668-03-08 13:03 r Here my Lady Jem. do promise to come, and bring my Lord Hinchingbroke and his lady some day this week, to dinner to me, which I am glad of.

1668-03-08 12:30   I to dinner with Sir G. Carteret to Lincoln’s Inn Fields, where I find mighty deal of company — a solemn day for some of his and her friends, and dine in the great dining-room above stairs, where Sir G. Carteret himself, and I, and his son, at a little table by.

1668-03-08 09:10   Sir J. Robinson, Lieutenant of the Tower, did call me with his coach, and carried me to White Hall, where met with very many people still that did congratulate my speech the other day in the House of Commons, and I find all the world almost rings of it.

1668-03-07 22:15   To the office, where I wrote what I had to write, and among others to my father to congratulate my sister’s marriage, and so home to supper a little and then to bed.

1668-03-07 17:20 r A very silly play, only great variety of dances, and those most excellently done, especially one part by one Hanes, only lately come thither from the Nursery, an understanding fellow, but yet, they say, hath spent 1000l. a-year before he come thither.

1668-03-07 14:04   Home to dinner, where Mercer with us, and after dinner she, my wife, Deb., and I, to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Spanish Gipsys,” the second time of acting, and the first that I saw it.

1668-03-06 22:07 r With the Lieutenant of the Tower, in his coach home; and there, with great pleasure, with my wife, talking and playing at cards a little — she, and I, and W. Hewer, and Deb., and so, after a little supper, I to bed.

1668-03-06 13:27 r My Lord Gerard, who never knew me before nor spoke to me, desires his being better acquainted with me; and that, at table where he was, he never heard so much said of any man as of me, in his whole life.

1668-03-06 11:42 r Mr. Vaughan did protest that he had sat 26 years in Parliament and never heard such a speech there before: for which the Lord God make me thankful! and that I may make use of it not to pride and vainglory, but that, now I have this esteem, I may do nothing that may lessen it!

1668-03-06 11:00 r Every body that saw me come to me with such eulogys as cannot be expressed. I met Mr. G. Montagu who kissed me and told me that he had often heretofore kissed my hands but now he would kiss my lips: protesting that I was another Cicero and said all the world said the same of me.

1668-03-06 10:08 r My Lord Barkeley did cry me up for what they had heard of it; and others, Parliament-men there, about the King, did say that they never heard such a speech in their lives delivered in that manner.

1668-03-06 09:32 r And, by and by, overtaking the King, the King and Duke of York come to me both; and he said, “Mr. Pepys, I am very glad of your success yesterday;” and fell to talk of my well speaking.

1668-03-06 09:10 r I to the Duke of York’s lodgings, and find him going to the Park, it being a very fine morning, and I after him; and he told me, with great satisfaction, that I had converted a great many yesterday, and did, with great praise of me, go on with the discourse with me.

1668-03-06 08:15 r He said that his brother admires me; and another gentleman said that I could not get less than 1000l. a-year if I would put on a gown and plead at the Chancery-bar; but, what pleases me most, the Sollicitor-Generall did protest that I spoke the best of any man in England.

1668-03-06 07:50   With Sir D. Gawden to Sir W. Coventry’s chamber: where the first word he said to me was, “Good-morrow, Mr. Pepys, that must be Speaker of the Parliament-house” and did protest I had got honour for ever in Parliament.

1668-03-05 21:00 r Home with W. Pen, and there to my wife, whom W. Hewer had told of my success, and she overjoyed, and I also as to my particular; and, after talking awhile, I betimes to bed, having had no quiet rest a good while.

1668-03-05 16:10 r However, it is plain we have got great ground; and everybody says I have got the most honour that any could have had opportunity of getting; and so with our hearts mightily overjoyed at this success, we all to dinner to Lord Brouncker’s.

1668-03-05 15:55 r But my speech, being so long, many had gone out to dinner and come in again half drunk; and then there are two or three that are professed enemies to us and every body else, these did rise up and speak against the coming to a vote now, the House not being full.

1668-03-05 15:45 r We were called in again by and by to answer only one question, touching our paying tickets to ticket-mongers; and so out; and we were in hopes to have had a vote this day in our favour, and so the generality of the House was.

1668-03-05 15:32 r All my Fellow-Officers, and all the world that was within hearing, did congratulate me, and cry up my speech as the best thing they ever heard; and my Fellow-Officers overjoyed in it.

1668-03-05 15:10 r I continued at it without any hesitation or losse, but with full scope, and all my reason free about me, as if it had been at my own table, from that time till past three in the afternoon; and so ended, without any interruption from the Speaker; but we withdrew.

1668-03-05 12:50 r I perceive the whole House was full, and full of expectation of our defence what it would be, and with great prejudice. After the Speaker had told us the dissatisfaction of the House, and read the Report of the Committee, I began our defence most acceptably and smoothly.

1668-03-05 11:24 r So we all up to the lobby; and between eleven and twelve o’clock, were called in, with the mace before us, into the House, where a mighty full House; and we stood at the bar, namely, Brouncker, Sir J. Minnes, Sir T. Harvey, and myself, W. Pen being in the House, as a Member.

1668-03-05 10:32 r I full of thoughts and trouble touching the issue of this day; and, to comfort myself, did go to the Dog and drink half-a-pint of mulled sack, and in the Hall did drink a dram of brandy; and with the warmth of this did find myself in better order as to courage, truly.

1668-03-05 09:00 r I did go down to the Old Swan, and there by boat, with T. Hater and W. Hewer with me, to Westminster, where I found myself come time enough, and my brethren all ready.

1668-03-05 07:30 r So with great trouble, but yet with some ease, from this discourse with my wife, I up, and to my Office, whither come my clerks, and so I did huddle the best I could some more notes for my discourse today.

1668-03-05 06:30 r With these thoughts I lay troubling myself, restless, and at last getting my wife to talk to me to comfort me, which she at last did, and made me resolve to quit my hands of this Office, and endure the trouble of it no longer than till I can clear myself of it.

1668-03-05 04:10 r Slept about three hours, but then waked, and never in so much trouble in all my life of mind, thinking of the task I have upon me, and upon what dissatisfactory grounds, and what the issue of it may be to me.

1668-03-04 22:10 r Quite weary, and dull, and vexed, I could go no further, but resolved to leave the rest to tomorrow morning, and so in full discontent and weariness did give over and went home, without supper vexed and sickish to bed.

1668-03-04 20:23 r Only with room for a little dinner, we very busy all the day till night that the officers met for me to give them the heads of what I intended to say, which I did with great discontent to see them all rely on me that have no reason at all to trouble myself about it.

1668-03-04 09:23   It being a cold wet day, I home with Sir J. Minnes in his coach, and called by the way at my bookseller’s and took home with me Kercher’s Musurgia — very well bound, but I had no comfort to look upon them, but as soon as I come home fell to my work at the office.

1668-03-03 23:57   I home and there to my chamber with Mr. Gibson, and late up till midnight preparing more things against our defence to my content, though vexed that all this trouble should be on me.

1668-03-03 15:10   Down by water to Deptford, where the King, Queene, and Court are to see launched the new ship built by Mr. Shish, called “The Charles.” God send her better luck than the former!

1668-03-03 08:20   Up betimes to work again, where to our great business of this answer to the Parliament; where to my great vexation I find my Lord Brouncker prepared only to excuse himself, while I, that have least reason to trouble myself, am preparing with great pains to defend them all.

1668-03-03 01:50   Home, and there I settle to business, and with my people preparing my great answer to the Parliament for the office about tickets till past 1 a o’clock at night, and then home to supper and to bed, keeping Mr. Gibson with me.

1668-03-02 17:13   With my wife and the girl to the King’s house to see the “Virgin Martyr” again, which do please me, but above all the musique at the coming down of the angel, which at this hearing the second time, do still commend me as nothing ever did, and the other music is nothing to it.

1668-03-02 10:44   W. Hewer tells me that the Officers of the Navy shall be all turned out, but honest Sir John Minnes, who, God knows, is fitter to have been turned out himself than any of us, doing the King more hurt by his dotage and folly than all the rest can do by their knavery.

1668-03-01 22:00   So without supper to bed, my eyes being also a little overwrought of late that I could not stay up to read.

1668-03-01 16:03 r To Mrs. Martin’s, and with great difficulty, company being there, did get an opportunity to hazer what I would con her, and here I was mightily taken with a starling which she hath, that was the King’s, which do whistle and talk the best that ever I heard anything in my life.

1668-03-01 14:33   To St. Margaret’s church, thinking to have seen Betty Michell, but she was not there, but met her father and mother and with them to her father’s house, where I never was before, but was mighty much made of, with some good strong waters, which they have from their son Michell.

1668-03-01 11:42   In lieu of a coach this year, I have got my wife to be contented with her closet being made up this summer, and going into the country for a month or two, to my father’s, and there Mercer and Deb. and Jane shall go with her, which I the rather do for the entertaining my wife.

1668-03-01 10:20 r We did here do the like about the complaint of want of victuals in the fleet in the year 1666, which will lie upon me to defend also. So that my head is full of care and weariness in my employment.

1668-03-01 08:50   Up very betimes, and by coach to Sir W. Coventry’s; and there, carrying with me all papers, did run over our whole defence in the business of tickets, in order to the answering the House; and I do think, unless they be set without reason to ruin us, we shall make a good defence.
