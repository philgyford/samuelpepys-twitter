1668-07-31 22:10   The month ends mighty sadly with me, my eyes being now past all use almost; and I am mighty hot upon trying the late printed experiment of paper tubes.

1668-07-31 19:48 r Sir J. Minnes giving us, like a gentleman, his coach, hearing we had some business, we to the Park, and so home. Little pleasure there, there being little company, but mightily taken with a little chariot that we saw in the street, and which we are resolved to have ours like it.

1668-07-31 17:24   Sir J. Minnes and I to my wife and took them two to the King’s house, to see the first day of Lacy’s “Monsieur Ragou,” now new acted. The King and Court all there, and mighty merry — a farce.

1668-07-31 12:50   With Mr. Ashburnham to the new Excise Office, and there discoursed about our business, and I made him admire my drawing a thing presently in shorthand: but, God knows! I have paid dear for it, in my eyes.

1668-07-30 09:32 r I staid and talked with Mr. May about the state of the King’s Offices in general, and how ill he is served, and do still find him an excellent person.

1668-07-30 08:50   By water to White Hall. There met with Mr. May, who was giving directions about making a close way for people to go dry from the gate up into the House, to prevent their going through the galleries; which will be very good.

1668-07-29 22:05 r To the New Exchange, and thence by water home, with much pleasure, and then to sing in the garden, and so home to bed, my eyes for these four days being my trouble, and my heart thereby mighty sad.

1668-07-29 19:10   I with my wife and two girls to the King’s house, and saw “The Mad Couple,” a mean play altogether, and thence to Hyde Parke, where but few coaches.

1668-07-29 12:40   Home to dinner, where Mercer, and there comes Mr. Swan, my old acquaintance, and dines with me, and tells me, for a certainty, that Creed is to marry Betty Pickering, and that the thing is concluded, which I wonder at, and am vexed for.

1668-07-28 17:45 r Here we saw Gosnell, who is become very homely, and sings meanly, I think, to what I thought she did.

1668-07-28 17:40   With my wife and Deb. to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there saw “The Slighted Maid,” but a mean play; and thence home, there being little pleasure now in a play, the company being but little.

1668-07-27 22:02   This day my plate-maker comes with my four little plates of the four Yards, cost me 5l., which troubles me, but yet do please me also.

1668-07-27 19:42   With my wife, and Deb, and Mercer, to Spring-Garden; and observe how rude some of the young gallants of the town are become, to go into people’s arbours where there are not men, and almost force the women; which troubled me, to see the confidence of the vice of the age.

1668-07-27 15:30   And so to see my Lord Crew, whom I find up; and did wait on him; but his face sore, but in hopes to do now very well again.

1668-07-27 13:50   To my bookseller in Duck Lane, but su moher not at home, and it was pretty here to see a pretty woman pass by with a little wanton look, and yo did sequi her round about the street from Duck Lane to Newgate Market, and then ella did turn back, and yo did lose her.

1668-07-26 17:00   With W. Hewer in my closet, setting right my Tangier Accounts, which I have let alone these six months and more, but find them very right, and is my great comfort.

1668-07-25 13:15   After dinner, to Cooper’s, it being a very rainy day, and there saw my wife’s picture go on, which will be very fine indeed.

1668-07-24 10:32 r I did lay open the whole failings of the Office, and how it was his duty to find them, and to find fault with them, as Admiral, especially at this time, which he agreed to, and seemed much to rely on what I said.

1668-07-24 10:10   After the Duke of York was ready, he called me to his closet; and I did long and largely show him the weakness of our Office, and did give him advice to call us to account for our duties, which he did take well and desired me to draw up what I would have him write to the Office.

1668-07-24 08:55   Up, and by water to St. James’s, having, by the way, shewn Symson Sir W. Coventry’s chimney-pieces, in order to the making me one.

1668-07-23 21:10   Up, and all day long, but at dinner, at the Office, at work, till I was almost blind, which makes my heart sad.

1668-07-22 22:22   This day a falling out between my wife and Deb., about a hood lost, which vexed me.

1668-07-22 16:10 r So to shew Symson the King’s new lodgings for his chimnies, which I desire to have one built in that mode.

1668-07-22 15:04   To White Hall with Symson the joyner, and after attending at the Committee of the Navy about the old business of tickets, where the only expedient they have found is to bind the Commanders and Officers by oaths.

1668-07-21 17:48   All the afternoon at the office, only went to my plate-maker’s, and there spent an hour about contriving my little plates, for my books of the King’s four Yards.

1668-07-20 19:42   Took occasion to buy a rest for my espinette at the ironmonger’s by Holborn Conduit, where the fair pretty woman is that I have lately observed there, and she is pretty, and yo creo vain enough.

1668-07-20 18:30   To visit my Lord Crew, who is very sick, to great danger, by an irisipulus; the first day I heard of it.

1668-07-20 17:03   Idling all the afternoon to Duck Lane, and there saw my bookseller’s moher, but get no ground there yet; and here saw Mrs. Michell’s daughter married newly to a bookseller, and she proves a comely little grave woman.

1668-07-20 15:02   With Mr. Colvill to the new Excise Office in Aldersgate Street, and thence back to the Old Exchange, to see a very noble fine lady I spied as I went through, in coming; and there took occasion to buy some gloves, and admire her, and a mighty fine fair lady indeed she was.

1668-07-20 09:04   To the office, where Mrs. Daniel comes and I could not tocar su cosa, she having ellos sobre her.

1668-07-19 17:31 r We dined: a good dinner, and company that pleased me mightily, being all eminent men in their way. Spent all the afternoon in talk and mirth.

1668-07-19 12:07   I up and down in the house spent the morning getting things ready against noon, when come Mr. Cooper, Hales, Harris, Mr. Butler, that wrote Hudibras, and Mr. Cooper’s cozen Jacke; and by and by comes Mr. Reeves and his wife, whom I never saw before.

1668-07-18 21:00   They say the King of France is making a war again, in Flanders, with the King of Spain; the King of Spain refusing to give him all that he says was promised him in the treaty.

1668-07-18 16:42   With my wife to the ’Change and Unthanke’s, after having been at Cooper’s and sat there for her picture, which will be a noble picture, but yet I think not so like as Hales’s is.

1668-07-18 13:12   Dined at home and Creed with me, who I do begin to hate, and do use him with some reservedness. Here was also my old acquaintance, Will Swan, to see me, who continues a factious fanatick still, and I do use him civilly, in expectation that those fellows may grow great again.

1668-07-17 22:55 r The weather excessive hot, so as we were forced to lie in two beds, and I only with a sheet and rug, which is colder than ever I remember I could bear.

1668-07-17 22:40   To see Betty Michell newly lain in, and after a little stay we took water and to Spring Garden, and there walked, and supped, and staid late, and with much pleasure, and to bed.

1668-07-16 22:20   So home, and to supper with my wife in the garden, it being these two days excessively hot, and so to bed.

1668-07-16 19:41   To Cooper’s, and saw his advance on my wife’s picture, which will be indeed very fine. So with her to the ’Change, to buy some things, and here I first bought of the sempstress next my bookseller’s, where the pretty young girl is, that will be a great beauty.

1668-07-16 16:57   I by water with my Lord Brouncker to Arundell House, to the Royall Society, and there saw an experiment of a dog’s being tied through the back, about the spinal artery, and thereby made void of all motion; and the artery being loosened again, the dog recovers.

1668-07-16 09:40   To the office, where Yeabsly and Lanyon come to town and to speak with me about a matter wherein they are accused of cheating the King before the Lords’ Commissioners of Tangier, and I doubt it true, but I have no hand in it, but will serve them what I can.

1668-07-16 06:40   Wonderful hot all day and night, and this the first night that I remember in my life that ever I could lie with only a sheet and one rug.

1668-07-15 21:09   Captain Deane come and spent the evening with me, to draw some finishing lines on his fine draught of “The Resolution,” the best ship, by all report, in the world.

1668-07-15 16:22 r But stayed here a while, and understood from Mrs. Pierce how my Lady Duchesse of Monmouth is still lame, and likely always to be so, which is a sad chance for a young lady to get, only by trying of tricks in dancing.

1668-07-15 15:50   To Unthanke’s to my wife, and with her and Deb. to visit Mrs. Pierce, whom I do not now so much affect, since she paints.

1668-07-15 13:00   Home to dinner, where is brought home the espinette I bought the other day of Haward; costs me 5l.

1668-07-15 12:04   All the morning busy at the office to my great content, attending to the settling of papers there that I may have the more rest in winter for my eyes by how much I do the more in the settling of all things in the summer by daylight.

1668-07-14 21:44   This day Bosse finished his copy of my picture, which I confess I do not admire, though my wife prefers him to Browne; nor do I think it like. He do it for W. Hewer, who hath my wife’s also, which I like less.

1668-07-14 16:01   My Lady Pickering come to see us: I busy, saw her not. But how natural it is for us to slight people out of power, and for people out of power to stoop to see those that while in power they contemned!

1668-07-13 22:15   So home, it being almost night, and there find in the garden Pelling, who hath brought Tempest, Wallington, and Pelham, to sings and there had most excellent music late, in the dark, with great pleasure.

1668-07-13 19:10   My people all by water to Deptford, to see Balty, while I to buy my espinette, which I did now agree for, and did at Haward’s meet with Mr. Thacker, and heard him play on the harpsicon, so as I never heard man before, I think.

1668-07-13 15:40   To Reeves’s, and there saw some, and bespoke a little perspective, and was mightily pleased with seeing objects in a dark room.

1668-07-13 14:28   To Ducke Lane, and there to the bookseller’s; at the Bible, whose moher yo have a mind to, but ella no era dentro, but I did there look upon and buy some books, and made way for coming again to the man, which pleases me.

1668-07-13 11:20   I was let blood, and did bleed about fourteen ounces, towards curing my eyes.

1668-07-12 17:38   This last night Betty Michell about midnight cries out, and my wife goes to her, and she brings forth a girl, and this afternoon the child is christened, and my wife godmother again to a Betty.

1668-07-12 17:10   Busy all the morning upon some accounts with W. Hewer, and at noon, an excellent dinner, comes Pelling and W. Howe, and the latter staid and talked with me all the afternoon.

1668-07-11 17:40   To the King’s playhouse, to see an old play of Shirly’s, called “Hide Parke” the first day acted; where horses are brought upon the stage but it is but a very moderate play, only an excellent epilogue spoke by Beck Marshall.

1668-07-10 22:14   With my people in a glass hackney-coach to the park, but was ashamed to be seen. So to the lodge, and drank milk, and so home to supper and to bed.

1668-07-10 16:40 r Now I understand Cooper’s great skill in music, his playing and setting to the French lute most excellently; and speaks French, and indeed is an excellent man.

1668-07-10 16:10   To Cooper’s; and there find my wife and W. Hewer and Deb., sitting, and painting; and here he do work finely, though I fear it will not be so like as I expected.

1668-07-10 14:40   To Haward’s to look upon an Espinette, and I did come near the buying one, but broke off. I have a mind to have one.

1668-07-10 11:15   To attend the Council, but all in vain, the Council spending all the morning upon a business about the printing of the Critickes, a dispute between the first Printer, one Bee that is dead, and the Abstractor, who would now print his Abstract, one Poole.

1668-07-09 20:48   To the office till night, mighty busy getting Mr. Fist to come and help me, my own clerks all busy.

1668-07-08 21:03   The Duke of York comes to the Robe-chamber, in hearing the business of the Master-Attendants of Chatham, and the Store-keeper of Woolwich; and resolves to displace them all; so hot he is of giving proofs of his justice at this time.

1668-07-08 15:48   Home to dinner; and then with my wife to Cooper’s, and there saw her sit; and he do do extraordinary things indeed.

1668-07-08 10:10   I to the Duke of York, to attend him about business of the Office; and find him mighty free to me, and how he is concerned to mend things in the Navy himself, and not leave it to other people.

1668-07-08 07:57   To Sir W. Coventry; and I find him much concerned in the present enquiries now on foot of the Commissioners of Accounts, though he reckons himself and the rest very safe, but vexed to see us liable to these troubles, in things wherein we have laboured to do best.

1668-07-07 19:19   With my wife and Deb. and Betty Turner to Unthanke’s, where we are fain to go round by Newgate, because of Fleet Bridge being under rebuilding.

1668-07-07 10:10   Kate Joyce come to me about some tickets of hers, but took no notice to me of her being married, but seemed mighty pale, and doubtful what to say or do, expecting that I should begin; and not finding me beginning, said nothing, but, with trouble in her face, went away.

1668-07-06 22:32   The Duchesse of Richmond sworn last week of the queen’s Bedchamber, and the King minding little else but what he used to do — about his women.

1668-07-06 22:20   Great doings at Paris, I hear, with their triumphs for their late conquests!

1668-07-06 22:14 r I to the playhouse, and saw a piece of the play, and glad to see Betterton; and so with wife and Deb. to Spring-garden, and eat a lobster, and so home in the evening and to bed.

1668-07-06 14:30 r Here comes Harris, and first told us how Betterton is come again upon the stage: whereupon my wife and company to the house to see “Henry the Fifth;” while I to attend the Duke of York at the Committee of the Navy, at the Council.

1668-07-06 14:20   To Mr. Cooper’s, and there met my wife and W. Hewer and Deb.; and there my wife first sat for her picture: but he is a most admirable workman, and good company.

1668-07-06 10:44   …and Tom Killigrew, in his being bred in Ram Ally, and now bound prentice to Lord Cottington, going to Spain with 1000l., and two suits of clothes.

1668-07-06 10:40   With W. Coventry walked in the Park together a good while. I hear many pretty stories of my Lord Chancellor’s being heretofore made sport of by Peter Talbot the priest, in his story of the death of Cardinall Bleau; by Lord Cottington, in his ‘Dolor de las Tyipas’…

1668-07-06 09:10   Attended the Duke of York, and was by himself told how angry he was, and did declare to my Lord Anglesey, about his late complaining of things of the Navy to the King in Council, and not to him; and I perceive he is mightily concerned at it, and resolved to reform things therein.

1668-07-05 16:40   At noon comes W. Hewer and Pelling, and young Michell and his wife, and dined with us, and most of the afternoon talking.

1668-07-05 12:03   About four in the morning took four pills of Dr. Turberville’s prescribing, for my eyes, and they wrought pretty well most of the morning.

1668-07-04 22:30   To Mile-End with my wife and girl, and there drank and eat a joie of salmon, at the Rose and Crown, our old house; and so home to bed.

1668-07-04 20:50   Home, and there busy sitting all the morning, and at noon dined, and then all the afternoon busy, till night.

1668-07-04 09:10 r Sir W. Coventry shewed me his closet, with his round table, for him to sit in the middle, very convenient; and I borrowed several books of him, to collect things out of the Navy, which I have not.

1668-07-04 08:40   Up, and to see Sir W. Coventry, and give him account of my doings yesterday, which he well liked of, and was told thereof by my Lord Halifax before; but I do perceive he is much concerned for this business.

1668-07-03 18:08 r But strange that this Turberville should be so great a man, and yet, to this day, had seen no eyes dissected, or but once, but desired this Dr. Lowre to give him the opportunity to see him dissect some.

1668-07-03 18:00   By water to Eagle Court in the Strand, and there to an alehouse: met Mr. Pierce, the Surgeon, and Dr. Clerke, Waldron, Turberville, my physician for the eyes, and Lowre, to dissect several eyes of sheep and oxen, with great pleasure, and to my great information.

1668-07-03 13:57 r I long with them, and see them hot set on this matter; but I did give them proper and safe answers. Vexed only at their denial of a copy of what I set my hand to, and swore.

1668-07-03 09:40   Betimes to the office, my head full of this business. Then by coach to the Commissioners of Accounts at Brooke House, the first time I was ever there, and there Sir W. Turner in the chair; and present, Lord Halifax, Thomson, Gregory, Dunster, and Osborne.

1668-07-02 22:10 r With my wife and Deb. by coach to take ayre to Mile-end, and so home and I to bed, vexed to be put to this frequent trouble in things we deserve best in.

1668-07-02 17:50 r All the afternoon busy to prepare an answer to this demand of the Commissioners of Accounts, and did discourse with Sir W. Warren about it.

1668-07-02 07:10   Called up by a letter from W. Coventry telling me that the Commissioners of Accounts intend to summons me about Sir W. Warren’s Hamburg contract, and so I up and to W. Coventry’s (he and G. Carteret being the party concerned in it).

1668-07-01 19:10   Home, calling at several places — among others, the ’Change, and on Cooper, to know when my wife shall come to sit for her picture, which will be next week, and so home.

1668-07-01 17:50   I to White Hall to a Committee of Tangier; and there vexed, with the importunity and clamours of Alderman Backewell, for my acquittance for money supplied by him to the garrison, before I have any order for paying it.

1668-07-01 15:20   I find the Duke of York very hot for regulations in the Navy; and is put on it by W. Coventry; and I am glad of it; and particularly, he falls heavy on Chatham-yard, and is vexed that Lord Anglesey did complain at the Council-table of disorders in the Navy, and not to him.

1668-07-01 12:00   Home to dinner, my Cozen Roger, come newly to town, dined with us, and mighty importunate for our coming down to Impington, which I think to do, this Sturbridge fair.
