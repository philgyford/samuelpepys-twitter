1668-07-11 17:40   To the King’s playhouse, to see an old play of Shirly’s, called “Hide Parke” the first day acted; where horses are brought upon the stage but it is but a very moderate play, only an excellent epilogue spoke by Beck Marshall.

1668-07-10 22:14   With my people in a glass hackney-coach to the park, but was ashamed to be seen. So to the lodge, and drank milk, and so home to supper and to bed.

1668-07-10 16:40 r Now I understand Cooper’s great skill in music, his playing and setting to the French lute most excellently; and speaks French, and indeed is an excellent man.

1668-07-10 16:10   To Cooper’s; and there find my wife and W. Hewer and Deb., sitting, and painting; and here he do work finely, though I fear it will not be so like as I expected.

1668-07-10 14:40   To Haward’s to look upon an Espinette, and I did come near the buying one, but broke off. I have a mind to have one.

1668-07-10 11:15   To attend the Council, but all in vain, the Council spending all the morning upon a business about the printing of the Critickes, a dispute between the first Printer, one Bee that is dead, and the Abstractor, who would now print his Abstract, one Poole.

1668-07-09 20:48   To the office till night, mighty busy getting Mr. Fist to come and help me, my own clerks all busy.

1668-07-08 21:03   The Duke of York comes to the Robe-chamber, in hearing the business of the Master-Attendants of Chatham, and the Store-keeper of Woolwich; and resolves to displace them all; so hot he is of giving proofs of his justice at this time.

1668-07-08 15:48   Home to dinner; and then with my wife to Cooper’s, and there saw her sit; and he do do extraordinary things indeed.

1668-07-08 10:10   I to the Duke of York, to attend him about business of the Office; and find him mighty free to me, and how he is concerned to mend things in the Navy himself, and not leave it to other people.

1668-07-08 07:57   To Sir W. Coventry; and I find him much concerned in the present enquiries now on foot of the Commissioners of Accounts, though he reckons himself and the rest very safe, but vexed to see us liable to these troubles, in things wherein we have laboured to do best.

1668-07-07 19:19   With my wife and Deb. and Betty Turner to Unthanke’s, where we are fain to go round by Newgate, because of Fleet Bridge being under rebuilding.

1668-07-07 10:10   Kate Joyce come to me about some tickets of hers, but took no notice to me of her being married, but seemed mighty pale, and doubtful what to say or do, expecting that I should begin; and not finding me beginning, said nothing, but, with trouble in her face, went away.

1668-07-06 22:32   The Duchesse of Richmond sworn last week of the queen’s Bedchamber, and the King minding little else but what he used to do — about his women.

1668-07-06 22:20   Great doings at Paris, I hear, with their triumphs for their late conquests!

1668-07-06 22:14 r I to the playhouse, and saw a piece of the play, and glad to see Betterton; and so with wife and Deb. to Spring-garden, and eat a lobster, and so home in the evening and to bed.

1668-07-06 14:30 r Here comes Harris, and first told us how Betterton is come again upon the stage: whereupon my wife and company to the house to see “Henry the Fifth;” while I to attend the Duke of York at the Committee of the Navy, at the Council.

1668-07-06 14:20   To Mr. Cooper’s, and there met my wife and W. Hewer and Deb.; and there my wife first sat for her picture: but he is a most admirable workman, and good company.

1668-07-06 10:44   …and Tom Killigrew, in his being bred in Ram Ally, and now bound prentice to Lord Cottington, going to Spain with 1000l., and two suits of clothes.

1668-07-06 10:40   With W. Coventry walked in the Park together a good while. I hear many pretty stories of my Lord Chancellor’s being heretofore made sport of by Peter Talbot the priest, in his story of the death of Cardinall Bleau; by Lord Cottington, in his ‘Dolor de las Tyipas’…

1668-07-06 09:10   Attended the Duke of York, and was by himself told how angry he was, and did declare to my Lord Anglesey, about his late complaining of things of the Navy to the King in Council, and not to him; and I perceive he is mightily concerned at it, and resolved to reform things therein.

1668-07-05 16:40   At noon comes W. Hewer and Pelling, and young Michell and his wife, and dined with us, and most of the afternoon talking.

1668-07-05 12:03   About four in the morning took four pills of Dr. Turberville’s prescribing, for my eyes, and they wrought pretty well most of the morning.

1668-07-04 22:30   To Mile-End with my wife and girl, and there drank and eat a joie of salmon, at the Rose and Crown, our old house; and so home to bed.

1668-07-04 20:50   Home, and there busy sitting all the morning, and at noon dined, and then all the afternoon busy, till night.

1668-07-04 09:10 r Sir W. Coventry shewed me his closet, with his round table, for him to sit in the middle, very convenient; and I borrowed several books of him, to collect things out of the Navy, which I have not.

1668-07-04 08:40   Up, and to see Sir W. Coventry, and give him account of my doings yesterday, which he well liked of, and was told thereof by my Lord Halifax before; but I do perceive he is much concerned for this business.

1668-07-03 18:08 r But strange that this Turberville should be so great a man, and yet, to this day, had seen no eyes dissected, or but once, but desired this Dr. Lowre to give him the opportunity to see him dissect some.

1668-07-03 18:00   By water to Eagle Court in the Strand, and there to an alehouse: met Mr. Pierce, the Surgeon, and Dr. Clerke, Waldron, Turberville, my physician for the eyes, and Lowre, to dissect several eyes of sheep and oxen, with great pleasure, and to my great information.

1668-07-03 13:57 r I long with them, and see them hot set on this matter; but I did give them proper and safe answers. Vexed only at their denial of a copy of what I set my hand to, and swore.

1668-07-03 09:40   Betimes to the office, my head full of this business. Then by coach to the Commissioners of Accounts at Brooke House, the first time I was ever there, and there Sir W. Turner in the chair; and present, Lord Halifax, Thomson, Gregory, Dunster, and Osborne.

1668-07-02 22:10 r With my wife and Deb. by coach to take ayre to Mile-end, and so home and I to bed, vexed to be put to this frequent trouble in things we deserve best in.

1668-07-02 17:50 r All the afternoon busy to prepare an answer to this demand of the Commissioners of Accounts, and did discourse with Sir W. Warren about it.

1668-07-02 07:10   Called up by a letter from W. Coventry telling me that the Commissioners of Accounts intend to summons me about Sir W. Warren’s Hamburg contract, and so I up and to W. Coventry’s (he and G. Carteret being the party concerned in it).

1668-07-01 19:10   Home, calling at several places — among others, the ’Change, and on Cooper, to know when my wife shall come to sit for her picture, which will be next week, and so home.

1668-07-01 17:50   I to White Hall to a Committee of Tangier; and there vexed, with the importunity and clamours of Alderman Backewell, for my acquittance for money supplied by him to the garrison, before I have any order for paying it.

1668-07-01 15:20   I find the Duke of York very hot for regulations in the Navy; and is put on it by W. Coventry; and I am glad of it; and particularly, he falls heavy on Chatham-yard, and is vexed that Lord Anglesey did complain at the Council-table of disorders in the Navy, and not to him.

1668-07-01 12:00   Home to dinner, my Cozen Roger, come newly to town, dined with us, and mighty importunate for our coming down to Impington, which I think to do, this Sturbridge fair.
