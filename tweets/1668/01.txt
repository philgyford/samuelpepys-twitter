1668-01-07 03:20 r To bed, weary and mightily pleased, and have the happiness to reflect upon it as I do sometimes on other things, as going to a play or the like, to be the greatest real comfort that I am to expect in the world, and that it is that that we do really labour in the hopes of.

1668-01-07 02:51 r I took Mrs. Turner and Hollworthy home to my house, and there gave wine and sweetmeats; but I find Mrs. Hollworthy but a mean woman, for understanding, only a little conceited, and proud. However, I was mightily pleased with her being there, I having long longed for to know her.

1668-01-07 02:05 r Anon comes in Mrs. Turner, the mother, and brings with her Mrs. Hollworthy, which pleased me mightily. And so to dancing again, and singing, with extraordinary great pleasure, till about two in the morning, and then broke up.

1668-01-06 23:57 r By and by to a very good supper, and mighty merry, and good music playing; and after supper to dancing and singing till about twelve at night.

1668-01-06 15:02 r To Mrs. Pierce, and took her and her cozen Corbet, Knepp and little James, and brought them to the Duke’s house; and, the house being full, was forced to carry them to a box, which did cost me 20s., besides oranges, which troubled me, though their company did please me.

1668-01-06 14:35   I ’light by the way to return home, thinking to have spoke with Mrs. Bagwell, whom I have not seen these twelve months, and voudrai haver hazer algo with her, sed she was gone, and so I took coach and away to my wife at the Duke of York’s house, in the pit, and so left her.

1668-01-06 12:50 r I, having done my business at court, did go home to dinner, and there find Mr. Harris, by the like mistake, come to dine with me. However, we did get a pretty dinner ready for him; and there he and I to discourse of many things, and I do find him a very excellent person.

1668-01-06 09:45 r Among others met with Mr. Pierce, by whom I find, as I was afeard from the folly of my wife, that he understood that he and his wife was to dine at my house today, whereas it was to sup.

1668-01-06 09:03   Leaving my wife to get her ready, and the maids to get a supper ready against night for our company; and I by coach to White Hall, and there up and down the house.

1668-01-05 19:23   To White Hall, and there up and down the house, and on the Queen’s side, to see the ladies, and there saw the Duchesse of York, whom few pay the respect they used, I think, to her; but she bears all out, with a very great deal of greatness; that is the truth of it.

1668-01-05 13:15 r Sir Philip Howard did take occasion to tell me at the table that I have got great ground in the Parliament, by my ready answers to all that was asked me there about the business of Chatham, and they would never let me be out of employment.

1668-01-05 11:50   Intending to go home, my Lady Carteret saw and called me out of her window, and so would have me home with her to Lincoln’s Inn Fields to dinner, and there we met with my Lord Brereton, and several other strangers, to dine there.

1668-01-05 09:15   I to Charing Cross, and there went into Unthanke’s to have my shoes wiped, dirty with walking, and so to White Hall, where I visited the Vice-Chamberlain, who tells me that the business of putting out of some of the Privy-council is over.

1668-01-05 08:10   My cozen Anthony Joyce met me, and it was to see what I would do upon what his wife a little while since did desire, which was to supply him 350l. to enable him to go to build his house again. I answered him that I would do it, and so I will, he offering me good security.

1668-01-04 22:10   Home with my mind pleased at the pleasure of despatching my business, and so to supper and to bed.

1668-01-03 17:35 r Away with it to the Council, and there do find that the Council hath altered its times of sitting to the mornings, and so I lost my labour.

1668-01-03 16:52   At the office all the morning with Mr. Willson and my clerks, consulting again about a new contract with the Victualler of the Navy, and at noon home to dinner, and then to the office, where busy all the afternoon preparing something for the Council about Tangier this evening.

1668-01-02 20:45 r But I do not like that she should receive it, it not being honourable for me to do it; and so do desire her to force him to take it back again, he leaving it against her will yesterday with her.

1668-01-02 20:43   This day my wife shows me a locket of dyamonds worth about 40l, which W. Hewer do press her to accept, and hath done for a good while, out of his gratitude for my kindness and hers to him.

1668-01-02 15:05   After dinner I took my wife and her girl out to the New Exchange, and there my wife bought herself a lace for a handkercher, which I do give her, of about 3l, for a new year’s gift, and I did buy also a lace for a band for myself, and so home.

1668-01-02 09:32 r The Prince said to me, standing by me, “God damn me, if they will turn out every man that will be drunk, they must turn out all the commanders in the fleet. What is the matter if he be drunk, so when he comes to fight he do his work?”

1668-01-02 09:01   To White Hall, and there attended the King and the Duke of York, with the rest of the Officers and many of the Commanders, and our master shipwrights, to discourse the business of having the topmasts of ships made to lower abaft of the mainmast; a business I understand not.

1668-01-01 22:02 r And lastly, to see the formality of the groome-porter, who is their judge of all disputes in play and all quarrels that may arise therein, and how his under-officers are there to observe true play at each table, and to give new dice.

1668-01-01 21:50 r To hear their cursing and damning to no purpose, as one man being to throw a seven if he could, and, failing to do it after a great many throws, cried he would be damned if ever he flung seven more while he lived, his despair of throwing it being so great.

1668-01-01 21:32 r To see how some old gamesters, that have no money now to spend as formerly, do come and sit and look on, as among others, Sir Lewis Dives, who was here, and hath been a great gamester in his time.

1668-01-01 21:10 r To see the different humours of gamesters to change their luck, when it is bad, how ceremonious they are as to call for new dice, to shift their places, to alter their manner of throwing, arid that with great industry, as if there was anything in it.

1668-01-01 20:45 r To see how differently one man took his losing from another, one cursing and swearing, and another only muttering and grumbling to himself, a third without any apparent discontent at all: to see how the dice will run good luck in one hand, and another have no good luck at all.

1668-01-01 20:12   Having it in my mind this Christmas to (do what I never can remember that I did) go to see the manner of the gaming at the Groome-Porter’s, Brisband did lead me thither.

1668-01-01 17:40 r When I begun first to be able to bestow a play on myself, I do not remember that I saw so many by half of the ordinary ’prentices and mean people in the pit at 2s. 6d. a-piece as now; I going for several years no higher than the 12d. and then the 18d. places.

1668-01-01 17:32   To the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there saw “Sir Martin Mar-all” which I have seen so often, and yet am mightily pleased with it, and think it mighty witty, and the fullest of proper matter for mirth that ever was writ; and I do see that they do improve in their acting of it.

1668-01-01 13:55 r Here they did talk much of the present cheapness of corne; so as their farmers can pay no rent, but do fling up their lands; and would pay in corne: but our gentry are grown so ignorant in every thing of good husbandry, that they know not how to bestow this corne.

1668-01-01 13:40 r Here was mighty good discourse: and among other things my Lord Crew did turn to a place in the Life of Sir Philip Sidney, wrote by Sir Fulke Greville, which do foretell the present condition of this nation, in relation to the Dutch, to the very degree of a prophecy.

1668-01-01 12:20   Abroad with my wife, who was to dine with W. Hewer and Willet at Mrs. Pierces, but I had no mind to be with them, for I do clearly find that my wife is troubled at my friendship with her and Knepp, and so dined with my Lord Crew.
