1668-01-31 21:57   I to my bookbinder’s, and there, till late at night, binding up my second part of my Tangier accounts, and I all the while observing his working, and his manner of gilding of books with great pleasure.

1668-01-31 12:50 r He did also tell me that in the late fire of London, that the fire burned as many Parish-Churches as there were hours from the beginning to the end of the fire; and that there were as many Churches left standing as there were taverns left standing in the rest of the City.

1668-01-31 12:37   Griffin did, in discourse in the coach, put me in the head of the little house by our garden, where old goodman Taylor puts his brooms and dirt, to make me a stable of, which I shall improve, so as, I think, to be able to get me a stable without much charge, which do please me.

1668-01-31 12:02 r Colonel Birch told me that he knew me to be a man of the old way for taking pains, and did always endeavour to do me right, and prevent any thing that was moved that might tend to my injury; which I was obliged to him for, and thanked him.

1668-01-31 11:57   Away to White Hall to the Commissioners of the Treasury; where, waiting some time, I there met with Colonel Birch; and he and I fell into discourse; and I did give him thanks for his kindness to me in the Parliament-house, both before my face and behind my back.

1668-01-31 10:49 r They did ask many questions, and demanded other books of me, which I did give them very ready and acceptable answers to; and, upon the whole, I observe they do go about their business like men resolved to go through with it, and in a very good method; like men of understanding.

1668-01-31 10:37 r I was called in, where I found the whole number of Commissioners, and was there received with great respect and kindness; and did give them great satisfaction, making it my endeavour to inform them what it was they were to expect from me, and what was the duty of other people.

1668-01-31 09:35 r I did observe a great many people attending about complaints of seamen concerning tickets, and, among others, Mr. Carcasse, and Mr. Martin, my purser.

1668-01-31 09:20   By coach, with W. Griffin with me, and our Contract-books, to Durham Yard, to the Commissioners for Accounts; the first time I ever was there; and staid awhile before I was admitted to them.

1668-01-30 19:36   I hear how the Committee for Accounts are mighty active and likely to examine every thing, but let them do their worst. I am to be before them with our contract books tomorrow.

1668-01-30 16:12 r I do desire heartily to be able to do her service, she being, methinks, a piece of care I ought to take upon me, for our fathers’ and friends’ sake, she being left alone, and no friend so near as me, or so able to help her.

1668-01-30 16:03 r I took coach and to her, and there found her in trouble, as I cannot blame her. But I do believe this arises from somebody that hath a mind to fright her into a composition for her estate, which I advise her against.

1668-01-30 14:39   When come home, I find Kate Joyce hath been there, with sad news that her house stands not in the King’s liberty, but the Dean of Paul’s; and so, if her estate be forfeited, it will not be in the King’s power to do her any good.

1668-01-30 13:57 r Had a good dinner, and good discourse between them, old men belonging to the law, and here I first heard that my cosen Pepys, of Salisbury Court, was Marshal to my Lord Cooke when he was Lord Chief Justice; which beginning of his I did not know to be so low: but so it was.

1668-01-30 12:12   Mr. Gibson and I, and our clerks, and Mr. Clerke, the solicitor, to a little ordinary in Hercules-pillars Ally — the Crowne, a poor, sorry place, where a fellow, in twelve years, hath gained an estate of, as he says, 600l. a-year, which is very strange, and there dined.

1668-01-30 00:02 r This evening come Betty Turner and the two Mercers, and W. Batelier, and they had fiddlers, and danced, and kept a quarter, which pleased me, though it disturbed me; but I could not be with them at all.

1668-01-29 23:57   All the afternoon and till 12 o’clock at night with Mr. Gibson at home upon my Tangier accounts, and did end them fit to be given the last of them to the Auditor tomorrow, to my great content.

1668-01-29 09:10 r Sir W. Coventry tells me that Townsend, of the Wardrobe, is the eeriest knave and bufflehead that ever he saw in his life, and wonders how my Lord Sandwich come to trust such a fellow.

1668-01-29 09:04   Sir W. Coventry believes there never was a kingdom so governed as this was in the time of the late Chancellor and the Treasurer, nobody minding or understanding any thing how things went or what the King had in his Treasury, or was to have, nothing in the world of it minded.

1668-01-28 20:14   My wife and I went and saw Kate Joyce, who is still in mighty sorrow, and the more from something that Dr. Stillingfleete should simply say in his sermon, of her husband’s manner of dying, as killing himself.

1668-01-28 18:00   My wife this day hears from her father and mother: they are in France, at Paris; he, poor good man! I think he is, gives her good counsel still, which I always observed of him, and thankful for my small charities to him.

1668-01-28 08:48   Up, and to the office, and there with W. Griffin talking about getting the place to build a coach-house, or to hire one, which I now do resolve to have, and do now declare it; for it is plainly for my benefit for saving money.

1668-01-27 09:04   I to Westminster, and there I do hear of the letter that is in the pamphlet this day of the King of France, declaring his design to go on against Flanders, and the grounds of it, which do set us mightily at rest.

1668-01-26 22:22   All the afternoon and evening very late doing serious business of my Tangier accounts, and examining my East India accounts, with Mr. Poynter, whom I employed all this day, to transcribe it fair.

1668-01-25 17:33   After dinner did fall to discourse about the business of the old contract between the King and the East India Company for the ships of the King that went thither, and about this did beat my brains all the afternoon.

1668-01-25 13:21   Mr. Hater and I to a tavern to meet Captain Minors, and dined; and there happened to be Mr. Prichard, a ropemaker of his acquaintance, and whom I know also, and did once mistake for a fiddler, which sung well, and I asked him for such a song that I had heard him sing.

1668-01-24 22:10   Home; and, after being at the Office, I home to supper, and to bed, my eyes being very bad again with overworking with them.

1668-01-24 17:22 r Found my wife and Deb, and saw many fine ladies, and sat by Colonell Reames, who understands and loves a play as well as I, and I love him for it.

1668-01-24 17:10 r I to the King’s playhouse, to fetch my wife, and there saw the best part of “The Mayden Queene,” which, the more I see, the more I love, and think one of the best plays I ever saw, and is certainly the best acted of any thing ever the House did, and particularly Becke Marshall.

1668-01-24 15:25 r  But it being late, and, indeed, not having a black cloak to lead her with, or follow the corps, I away, and saw, indeed, a very great press of people follow the corps.

1668-01-24 15:21 r Here I staid with a very great rabble of four or five hundred people of mean condition, and I staid in the room with the kindred till ready to go to church, where there is to be a sermon of Dr. Stillingfleete, and thence they carried him to St. Sepulchre’s.

1668-01-24 14:20   After dinner carried my wife to the Temple, and thence she to a play, and I to St. Andrew’s church, in Holburne, at the Quest House, where the company meets to the burial of my cousin Joyce.

1668-01-23 22:13 r And, among other things, a new-fashioned case for a pair of snuffers, which is very pretty; but I could never have guessed what it was for, had I not seen the snuffers in it.

1668-01-23 22:10   To Mrs. Turner’s, where my wife, and Deb, and I, and Batelier supped, and played at cards, and very merry. She is either a very prodigal woman, or richer than she would be thought, by her buying of the best things, and laying out much money in new-fashioned pewter.

1668-01-23 12:49   I find the Bishop of Lincolne come to dine with us; and there mighty good company. But the Bishop a very extraordinary good-natured man, and one that is mightily pleased, as well as I am, that I live so near Bugden, the seat of his bishopricke, where he is like to reside.

1668-01-22 21:46 r But, Lord! how did I please myself to make Betty Turner sing, to see what a beast she is as to singing, not knowing how to sing one note in tune; but I would not for 40s. hear her sing a tune: worse than my wife a thousand times, so that it do a little reconcile me to her.

1668-01-22 21:40   So home, and there to cards with my wife, Deb, and Betty Turner, and Batelier, and after supper late to sing.

1668-01-22 18:10   To my cousin’s, and there find the Crowner’s jury sitting, but they put off the business to Shrove Tuesday, and so do give way to the burying of him; but they incline to find it a natural death, though there are busy people to have it go otherwise, thinking to get his estate.

1668-01-22 15:28   This day come the first demand from the Commissioners of Accounts to us, and it contains more than we shall ever be able to answer while we live, and I do foresee we shall be put to much trouble and some shame, at least some of us.

1668-01-22 13:32   With Lord Brouncker to Sir D. Gawden’s, at the Victualling-Office, to dinner, where I have not dined since he was Sheriff: He expected us; and a good dinner, and much good company; and a fine house, and especially two rooms, very fine, he hath built there.

1668-01-21 21:45 r Away back again to my cousin’s. I find her all in sorrow, but she and the rest mightily pleased with my doing this for them; and, indeed, it was a great courtesy, for people are looking out for the estate, and the coroner will be sent to, and a jury called to examine his death.

1668-01-21 20:36 r At their entreaty, I took coach to White Hall and there find Sir W. Coventry; and he carried me to the King, and there told my story which I had told him: and the King, without more ado, granted that, if it was found, the estate should be to the widow and children.

1668-01-21 19:55 r I to my cousin’s again; where I no sooner come but news was brought down from his chamber that he was departed.

1668-01-21 19:19 r With Sir D. Gawden, to Guild Hall, to advise with the Towne-Clerke about the practice of the City and nation in this case: and he thinks that it cannot be found self-murder; but if it be, it will fall, all the estate, to the King.

1668-01-21 11:52 r They being in fear that the estate would be seized on, because of his endeavouring to drown himself, my cousin did endeavour to remove what she could of plate out of the house, and desired me to take my flagons; which I was glad of, and did take them away with me.

1668-01-21 11:34 r He confessed his doing the thing, being led by the Devil; and do declare his reason to be his trouble that he found in having forgot to serve God as he ought, since he come to this new employment: and I believe that, and his great loss by the fire, did bring him to it.

1668-01-21 11:32 r The story is that he went quiet out of doors in the morning to Islington, and behind the White Lion did fling himself into a pond, was spied by a poor woman and got out by some people there, and set on his head and got to life, and known by a woman; and so his wife sent for.

1668-01-21 11:15 r I to him, and find him in his sick bed (I never was at their house, this Inne, before) very sensible in discourse and thankful for my kindness to him, and his breath rattled in his throate, and they did lay pigeons to his feet, and all despair of him, and with good reason.

1668-01-21 10:02   While at the office comes news from Kate Joyce that if I would see her husband alive, I must come presently.

1668-01-20 13:52   To my Lord Crew’s to dinner, where we hear all the good news of our making a league now with Holland against the French power coming over them or us, which is the first good act that hath been done a great while, and done secretly, and with great seeming wisdom.

1668-01-20 12:10   I did stop at Drumbleby’s, the pipe-maker, there to advise about the making of a flageolet to go low and soft; and he do show me a fashion of having two pipes of the same note fastened together, so as I can play on one, and then echo it upon the other, which is mighty pretty.

1668-01-19 17:02   Perryman and I talking of the great miscarriages in the Navy, and among the principal that of having gentlemen commanders. I shall make use of his and others’ help to reckon up and put down in writing what is fit to be mended in the Navy after all our sad experience therein.

1668-01-19 15:08   I sent for Mr. Shish to advise about my vessel, “The Maybolt,” and I do resolve to sell for any thing rather than keep her longer, having already lost 100l. in her value, which I was once offered and refused, and the ship left without any body to look to her, which vexes me.

1668-01-18 15:27   Carried my wife and Deb. to the ’Change, where they bought some things, while I bought “The Mayden Queene,” a play newly printed, which I like at the King’s house so well, of Mr. Dryden’s, which he himself, in his preface, seems to brag of, and indeed is a good play.

1668-01-18 12:04   At the office all the morning busy sitting.

1668-01-17 10:03   I talked with Creed, who tells me of Mr. Harry Howard’s giving the Royal Society a piece of ground next to his house, to build a College on, which is a most generous act.

1668-01-17 09:17 r This will make the world think that the King hath good councillors about him, when the Duke of Buckingham, the greatest man about him, is a fellow of no more sobriety than to fight about a whore.

1668-01-17 09:15 r Her husband challenged him, and they met yesterday in a close near Barne-Elmes: my Lord Shrewsbury is run through the body, from the right breast through the shoulder, and Sir John Talbot all along up one of his arms; and Jenkins killed upon the place, and the rest wounded.

1668-01-17 09:09   From the house the discourse of the duell yesterday between the Duke of Buckingham, Holmes, and Jenkins, on one side, and my Lord of Shrewsbury, Sir John Talbot, and Bernard Howard, on the other side: and all about my Lady Shrewsbury, who is a whore to the Duke of Buckingham.

1668-01-17 00:20 r So little care there has been to this day to know or keep any history of the Navy.

1668-01-17 00:12   My work this night with my clerks at the office was to examine my list of ships I am making for myself and their dimensions, and to see how it agrees or differs from other lists, and I do find so great a difference between them all that I am at a loss which to take.

1668-01-16 12:53   Home to dinner with my gang of clerks, in whose society I am mightily pleased; Mr. Gibson telling me so many good stories relating to the warr, which I will find a time to recollect; and he will be an admirable help to my writing a history of the Navy, if ever I do.

1668-01-16 11:50   To the office, where sat all the morning, and here Lord Anglesey tells us again that a fleet is to be set out; and that it is generally, he hears, said, that it is but a Spanish rhodomontado.

1668-01-15 19:32 r I did lose my labour, and so walked back again, but with pleasure by the walk, and I had the sport to see two boys swear, and stamp, and fret, for not being able to get their horse over a stile and ditch, one of them swearing and cursing most bitterly.

1668-01-15 19:02   I walked by moonlight to Deptford, where I have not been a great while, and my business I did there was only to walk up and down above la casa of Bagwell, but could not see her, it being my intent to have spent a little time con her, she being newly come from her husband.

1668-01-15 16:40   It is voted in Council to have a fleet of 50 ships out; but it is only a disguise for the Parliament to get some money by; but it will not take, and if it did, I do not think it will be such as he will get any of, nor such as will enable us to set out such a fleet.

1668-01-15 02:14   I to my chamber, having a great many books brought me home from my bookbinder’s, and so I to the new setting of my books against the next year, which costs me more trouble than I expected.

1668-01-14 17:13 r It seems Mis Davis is a bastard of Colonell Howard, my Lord Berkshire, and that he do pimp to her for the King, and hath got her for him; but Pierce says that she is a most homely jade as ever she saw, though she dances beyond any thing in the world.

1668-01-14 17:09 r The King, it seems, hath given Mis Davis a ring of 700l, which she shews to every body, and owns that the King did give it her; and he hath furnished a house for her in Suffolke Street most richly, which is a most infinite shame.

1668-01-14 17:05 r That she did sit near the players of the Duke’s house; among the rest, Mis Davis, who is the most impertinent slut, she says, in the world; and the more, now the King do show her countenance; and is reckoned his mistress, even to the scorne of the whole world.

1668-01-14 17:02   To Mrs. Pierce’s, where my wife and Deb. is; and there they fell to discourse of the last night’s work at Court, where the ladies and Duke of Monmouth and others acted “The Indian Emperour,” wherein they told me these things most remarkable.

1668-01-14 15:24 r He says that one warehouse of books was saved under Paul’s; and that there were several dogs found burned among the goods in the church-yard, and but one man that said he would go and save a blanket which he had in the church and, being a weak old man, the fire overcome him.

1668-01-14 15:20 r He tells me that it took fire first upon the end of a board that was laid upon the roof instead of lead, the lead being broke off, and thence down lower and lower: but that the burning of the goods under St. Fayth’s arose from the goods taking fire in the church-yard.

1668-01-14 15:15   To my bookseller, Martin, and there did receive my book I expected of China, a most excellent book with rare cuts; and there fell into discourse with him about the burning of Paul’s when the City was burned; his house being in the church-yard.

1668-01-13 23:03   Busy about my Tangier accounts against tomorrow, which I do get ready in good condition, and so with great content to bed.

1668-01-13 10:10   Stopped at Martin’s, my bookseller, where I saw the French book which I did think to have had for my wife to translate, called “L’escholle des filles,” but when I come to look in it, it is the most bawdy, lewd book that ever I saw, so that I was ashamed of reading in it.

1668-01-12 11:20   Went to church, where first I saw Alderman Backewell and his lady come to our church, they living in Mark Lane; and I could find in my heart to invite her to sit with us, she being a fine lady.

1668-01-12 08:08 r I do find my wife do keep very bad remembrances of my former unkindness to her, and do mightily complain of her want of money and liberty, which I will rather hear and bear the complaint of than grant the contrary, and so we had very hot work a great while.

1668-01-12 08:03 r Which I not presently agreeing to, she declared, if he come, she would not live with me, but would shame me all over the city and court, which I made slight of, and so we fell very foul.

1668-01-12 08:00   My wife fell to discourse of my father’s coming to live with us when my sister marries. This, she being afeard of declaring an absolute hatred to him since his falling out with her about Coleman’s being with her, she declares against his coming hither.

1668-01-11 22:10   With my wife for half an hour walking in the moonlight, and it being cold, frosty weather, walking in the garden, and then home to supper, and so by the fireside to have my head combed, as I do now often do, by Deb., whom I love should be fiddling about me, and so to bed.

1668-01-11 17:40 r Knepp told me also of a play shortly coming upon the stage which will be called “The Wandering Ladys,” a comedy that, she thinks, will be most pleasant; and another play, called “The Duke of Lerma,” which she thinks will not be acted for a good while.

1668-01-11 17:33 r The King did send several times for Nelly, and she was with him, but what he did she knows not; this was a good while ago, and she says that the King first spoiled Mrs. Weaver, which is very mean, methinks, in a prince, and I am sorry for it.

1668-01-11 17:30 r Knepp come and sat by us, and her talk pleased me a little, she telling me how Mis Davis is for certain going away from the Duke’s house, the King being in love with her; and a house is taken for her, and furnishing; and she hath a ring given her already worth 600l.

1668-01-11 17:20   To see “The Wild-goose Chase,” which I never saw, but have long longed to see it, being a famous play, but I do find that where I expect most I find least satisfaction, for in this play I met with nothing extraordinary at all, but very dull inventions and designs.

1668-01-11 08:10   Talking with my wife about Pall’s business, and she do conclude to have her married here; and to have W. Hewer, and Batelier, and Mercer, and Willet bridemen and bridemaids, and to be very merry; and so I am glad of it, and do resolve to let it be done as soon as I can.

1668-01-10 21:18 r I shall be eased of one care how to provide for her, and do think that it may be a match proper enough to have her married there, and to one that may look after my concernments if my father should die and I continue where I am, and therefore I am well pleased with it.

1668-01-10 21:15   This day I received a letter from my father, and another from my cosen Roger Pepys, who have had a view of Jackson’s evidences of his estate, and do mightily like of the man, and his condition and estate, and do advise me to accept of the match for my sister.

1668-01-10 17:27   With my wife and Deb. to the King’s house, to see “Aglaura,” which hath been always mightily cried up; and so I went with mighty expectation, but do find nothing extraordinary in it at all, and but hardly good in any degree.

1668-01-10 10:37 r I have bought many books lately to a great value; but I think to buy no more till Christmas next, and those that I have will so fill my two presses that I must be forced to give away some to make room for them, it being my design to have no more for my library than to fill them.

1668-01-10 10:29   To my new bookseller’s, Martin’s; and there did meet with Fournier, the Frenchman, that hath wrote of the Sea and Navigation, and I could not but buy him, and also bespoke an excellent book, which I met with there, of China.

1668-01-10 09:50 r There was a Persian in that country dress, with a turban, waiting to kiss the King’s hand in the Vane-room, against he come out: it was a comely man as to features, and his dress, methinks, very comely.

1668-01-10 09:31   In the King’s Greenroom we found my Lord Bristoll walking alone; which, wondering at, while the Council was sitting, I was answered that, as being a Catholique, he could not be of the Council, which I did not consider before.

1668-01-09 20:40 r But I do propose to my father to think of Mr. Cumberland rather than this Jackson that he is upon; and I confess I have a mighty mind to have a relation so able a man, and honest, and so old an acquaintance as Mr. Cumberland.

1668-01-09 20:32   Wrote to my father about lending Anthony Joyce the money he desires; and I declare that I would do it as part of Pall’s portion, and that Pall should have the use of the money till she be married.

1668-01-09 13:27   Home at noon to dinner with my people, where Mr. Hollier come and dined with me, and it is still mighty pleasant to hear him talk of Rome and the Pope, with what hearty zeal and hatred he talks against him.

1668-01-09 09:50   Visited by my cosen Anthony Joyce about the 350l. which he desires me to lend him, and which I have a mind enough to do, but would have it in my power to call it out again in a little time, and so do take a little further time to consider it.

1668-01-08 21:20   I by coach to the ’Change, and there took up my wife and Mercer and the girl by agreement, and so home, and there with Mercer to teach her more of “It is decreed,” and to sing other songs and talk all the evening.

1668-01-08 13:55   Home to the office, and so with my Lord Brouncker and his mistress, Williams, to Captain Cocke’s to dinner, where was Temple and Mr. Porter, and a very good dinner, and merry.

1668-01-08 09:33   It being dirty, I by coach (which I was forced to go to the change for) to White Hall, and there did deliver the Duke of York a memorial for the Council about the case of Tangiers want of money; and I was called in there and my paper was read.

1668-01-07 17:48 r By and by they come home, and had been at the King’s House and saw me, and there I walked with them in the garden awhile, and to sing with Mercer there a little, and taught her a little of my “It is decreed” which I have a mind to have her learn to sing, and she will do it well.

1668-01-07 15:10 r Therefore to the other two playhouses, to gaze up and down to look for them, and there did by this means, for nothing, see an act in “The Schoole of Compliments” at the Duke of York’s house, and “Henry the Fourth” at the King’s house; but, not finding them, I home.
