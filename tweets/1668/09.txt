1668-09-29 12:03   Up, and to the Office, where all the morning.

1668-09-28 21:58   I do hear this day what troubles me, that Sir W. Coventry is quite out of play, the King seldom speaking to him; and that there is a design of making a Lord Treasurer, and that my Lord Arlington shall be the man; but I cannot believe it.

1668-09-28 21:18 r It was indeed very good together; but yet there was but one voice that alone did appear considerable, and that was Seignor Joanni.

1668-09-28 21:15   I to White Hall, and there all the evening on the Queen’s side; and it being a most summerlike day, and a fine warm evening, the Italians come in a barge under the leads, before the Queen’s drawing-room; and so the Queen and ladies went out, and heard them, for almost an hour.

1668-09-28 17:44   I by coach towards the King’s playhouse, and meeting W. Howe took him with me, and there saw “The City Match;” not acted these thirty years, and but a silly play: the King and Court there; the house, for the women’s sake, mighty full.

1668-09-28 13:20   To the Exchequer, and so home by water, and after eating a bit I to my vintner’s, and there did only look upon su wife, which is mighty handsome; and so to my glove and ribbon shop, in Fenchurch Street, and did the like there.

1668-09-28 11:32 r Here I also, standing by a candle that was brought for sealing of a letter, do set my periwigg a-fire, which made such an odd noise, nobody could tell what it was till they saw the flame, my back being to the candle.

1668-09-28 11:10 r Here my Lady Hinchingbroke tells me that she hath bought most of the wedding-clothes for Mrs. Pickering, so that the thing is gone through, and will soon be ended; which I wonder at, but let them do as they will.

1668-09-28 10:45 r Sidney is mighty grown; and I am glad I am here to see him at his first coming, though it cost me dear, for here I come to be necessitated to supply them with 500l. for my Lord. He sent him up with a declaration to his friends of the necessity of his being supplied with 2000l.

1668-09-28 10:30   To my Lord Burlington’s house the first time I ever was there; I visited my Lord Hinchingbroke and his lady; Mr. Sidney Montagu being come last night to town unexpectedly from Mount’s Bay, where he left my Lord well, so as we may now expect to hear of his arrival at Portsmouth.

1668-09-28 09:00   By water to St. James’s, and there had good opportunity of speaking with the Duke of York, who desires me again, talking on that matter, to prepare something for him to do for the better managing of our Office.

1668-09-28 07:15 r I did give the pretty maid Betty that comes to me half-a-crown for coming, and had a baiser or two — elle being mighty jolie. And so I about my business.

1668-09-28 07:04   Up betimes, and Knepp’s maid comes to me, to tell me that the women’s day at the playhouse is today, and that therefore I must be there, to encrease their profit.

1668-09-27 20:30   My Lord Brouncker told me the difference that is now between the three Embassadors here, the Venetian, French, and Spaniard; the third not being willing to make a visit to the first, because he would not receive him at the door.

1668-09-27 13:58   I to the Queen’s Chapel, and there heard some good singing; and so to White Hall, and saw the King and Queen at dinner and thence with Sir Stephen Fox to dinner: and the Cofferer with us; and there mighty kind usage, and good discourse.

1668-09-27 11:00   Mr. Wren; and he and I walked together in the Pell-Mell, it being most summer weather that ever was seen. And here talking of several things, of the corruption of the Court, and how unfit it is for ingenious men, and himself particularly, to live in it.

1668-09-26 17:58 r To my house, where D. Gawden did talk a little, and he do mightily acknowledge my kindness to him, and I know I have done the King and myself good service in it.

1668-09-26 16:30 r To my great content, the Duke of York, at coming out, told me that it was carried for D. Gawden at 6d. 8d., and 8¾d.; but with great difficulty, I understand, both from him and others.

1668-09-26 16:15 r To White Hall, and there attended the King and Council, who met and heard our answer. I present, and then withdrew; and they spent two hours at least afterwards about it, and at last rose.

1668-09-26 13:58   I away and walked to Charing Cross, and there into the great new Ordinary, by my Lord Mulgrave’s, being led thither by Mr. Beale, one of Oliver’s, and now of the King’s Guards; and he sat with me while I had two grilled pigeons, very handsome and good meat.

1668-09-26 12:50   I to Westminster Hall and there stayed a little, and at the Swan also, thinking to have got Doll Lane thither, but elle did not understand my signs.

1668-09-26 08:40   Could sleep but little last night, for my concernments in this business of the victualling for Sir D. Gawden, so up in the morning and he comes to me, and there I did tell him all, and give him my advice, and so he away.

1668-09-25 15:00   Gibson having wrote our answer fair and got Brouncker and the rest to sign it, I by coach to White Hall to the Committee of the Council, which met late, and Brouncker and J. Minnes with me, and there the Duke of York present, where our answer was read and debated.

1668-09-25 12:55   To dinner, and W. Batelier with me, who is lately come from Impington, beyond which I perceive he went not, whatever his pretence at first was; and so he tells me how well and merry all are there, and how nobly used by my cozen.

1668-09-24 20:14 r Close with Mr. Gibson till night, drawing up our answer, which I did the most part by seven at night, and so to Lord Brouncker and the rest at his lodgings to read it, and they approved of it.

1668-09-24 12:12 r Up betimes and Sir D. Gawden with me, and I told him all, being very desirous for the King’s sake, as well as my own, that he may be kept in it, and after consulting him I to the Office, where we met again and spent most of the morning about this business.

1668-09-23 16:10   To a Committee of the Council. They did give us, the Officers of the Navy, the proposals of the bidders for the victualling of the Navy for us to give our answer to which is the best, and whether it be better to victual by commission or contract, which is a great deal of work.

1668-09-23 12:30   Comes Mr. Evelyn to me and tells me of his loss, to the value of 500l, which he hath met with, in an attempt of making of bricks upon an adventure with others, by which he presumed to have got a great deal of money. So that I see the most ingenious men may sometimes be mistaken.

1668-09-22 22:30 r They gone, Mrs. Turner and I to walk in the garden, and there yo did the second part of Sunday night last, tocando su cosa and making her tocar mi thing, but no mas — which she did bear with very merrily, but with a seeming remorse. So led her home, and I back to bed.

1668-09-22 21:34 r By and by comes Sir W. Pen, and eat with us, and mighty merry, in appearance, at least, he being on all occasions glad to be at friendship with me, though we hate one another, and know it on both sides.

1668-09-22 20:55 r In the garden there comes to me my Lady Pen and Mrs. Turner and Markham, and we sat and talked together, and I carried them home, and there eat a bit of something.

1668-09-22 20:00   In the evening spent my time walking in the dark, in the garden, to favour my eyes, which I find nothing but ease to help.

1668-09-21 21:52   This day also come out first the new five-pieces in gold, coined by the Guiny Company; and I did get two pieces of Mr. Holder.

1668-09-21 20:48   Home, where I find my draught of “The Resolution” come, finished, from Chatham; but will cost me, one way or other, about 12l. or 13l., in the board, frame, and garnishing, which is a little too much, but I will not be beholden to the King’s officers that do it.

1668-09-21 19:50 r I away with Payne, the waterman. He, seeing me at the play, did get a link to light me, and so light me to the Beare, where Bland, my waterman, waited for me with gold and other things he kept for me, to the value of 40l, which I had about me, for fear of my pockets being cut.

1668-09-21 18:54 r Took acquaintance with a fellow that carried me to a tavern, and by and by Jacob Hall himself, with whom I had a mind to speak, to hear whether he had ever any mischief by falls in his time. He told me, “Yes, many; but never to the breaking of a limb.”

1668-09-21 17:03 r To Jacob Hall’s dancing on the ropes, where I saw such action as I never saw before, and mightily worth seeing.

1668-09-21 15:42   By water to Somerset House, but when come thither I turned back and to Southwarke-Fair, very dirty, and there saw the puppet-show of Whittington, which was pretty to see; and how that idle thing do work upon people that see it, and even myself too!

1668-09-21 13:04   By water home to dinner with my people, where Tong was also this day with me, whom I shall employ for a time.

1668-09-21 10:04   To St. James’s, and the Duke of York did of his own accord come to me, and tell me that he had read, and do like of, my answers to the objections which he did give me the other day, about the Navy; and so did W. Coventry too, who told me that the Duke of York had shown him them.

1668-09-20 22:10 r Mrs. Turner staid with me and yo did the first time tocar her cosa with my hand and did make her do the like con su hand to my thing, whereto neither did she show any averseness, but a merry kind of opposition, but yo do believe I might have hecho la cosa too mit her.

1668-09-20 20:34   Took my Lady Pen and Mrs. Markham home with me and sent for Mrs. Turner, and by and by comes Sir W. Pen and supped with me, a good supper, part of my dinner today.

1668-09-20 16:42 r Walked to Gray’s Inn walks a while, but little company; and so over the fields to Clerkenwell, to see whether I could find that the fair Botelers do live there still, I seeing Frances the other day in a coach with Cary Dillon, her old servant, but know not where she lives.

1668-09-20 15:30   Got a coach and to visit Mrs. Pierce, with whom, and him, I staid a little while, and do hear how the Duchesse of Monmouth is at this time in great trouble of the shortness of her lame leg, which is likely to grow shorter and shorter, that she will never recover it.

1668-09-20 13:25 r And so to dinner alone, having since church heard the boy read over Dryden’s Reply to Sir R. Howard’s Answer, about his Essay of Poesy, and a letter in answer to that; the last whereof is mighty silly, in behalf of Howard.

1668-09-20 13:10   Home to dinner, staying till past one o’clock for Harris, whom I invited, and to bring Shadwell the poet with him; but they come not, and so a good dinner lost, through my own folly.

1668-09-19 21:04   Mr. Trevor is now to be Secretary, in Morrice’s place. And Parliament is to be adjourned to the 1st of March, which do please me well, hoping thereby to get my things in a little better order than I should have done; and the less attendances at that end of the town in winter.

1668-09-19 17:32 r Here was my Lord Brouncker and W. Pen and their ladies in the box, being grown mighty kind of a sudden; but, God knows, it will last but a little while, I dare swear. Knepp did her part mighty well.

1668-09-19 17:28   To the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Silent Woman;” the best comedy, I think, that ever was wrote; and sitting by Shadwell the poet, he was big with admiration of it.

1668-09-18 17:34   So to the King’s house, and saw a piece of “Henry the Fourth;” at the end of the play, thinking to have gone abroad with Knepp, but it was too late, and she to get her part against tomorrow, in “The Silent Woman,” and so I only set her at home.

1668-09-18 09:13 r So now I am at rest in that matter, and shall be more, when my copies are finished of their answers, which I am now taking with all speed.

1668-09-18 09:10   To the Duke of York, and there had opportunity of delivering my answer to his letter, which he did not read, as looking on it as a thing I needed not have done, but only that I might not give occasion to the rest to suspect my communication with the Duke of York against them.

1668-09-17 19:38 r Batelier comes to tell me that he was going down to Cambridge to my company, to see the Fair, which vexed me, and the more because I fear he do know that Knepp did dine with me today.

1668-09-17 17:15 r I to St. James’s, but missed of the Duke of York, and so went back to the King’s playhouse, and saw “Rollo, Duke of Normandy,” which, for old acquaintance, pleased me pretty well.

1668-09-17 13:40 r I carried Knepp to the playhouse; and in the way did give her five guineas as a fairing, I having given her nothing a great while, and her coming hither sometimes having been matter of cost to her.

1668-09-17 12:55   At noon comes Knepp, with design to dine with Lord Brouncker, but she being undressed, and there being much company, dined with me.

1668-09-17 11:57   Up, and all the morning sitting at the office, where every body grown mighty cautious in what they do, or omit to do.

1668-09-16 21:21   This day my father’s letters tell me of the death of poor Fancy, in the country, big with puppies, which troubles me, as being one of my oldest acquaintances and servants. Also Goody Stankes is dead.

1668-09-16 19:04   Mr. Gibson to read to me the life of Archbishop Laud, wrote by Dr. Heylin; which is a shrewd book, but that which I believe will do the Bishops in general no great good, but hurt, it pleads for so much Popish.

1668-09-16 17:38   All the afternoon with Mr. Gibson, writing over anew, and a little altering, my answer to the Duke of York, which I have not yet delivered, and so have the opportunity of doing it after seeing all their answers, though this do give me occasion to alter very little.

1668-09-16 10:34 r Here, among a thousand coaches that were there, I saw and spoke to Mrs. Pierce: and by and by Mr. Wren hunts me out, and gives me my Lord Anglesey’s answer to the Duke of York’s letter, where he do do what he can to hurt me, by bidding the Duke of York call for my books.

1668-09-16 10:12 r So I took a hackney-coach and saw it all: and indeed it was mighty noble, and their firing mighty fine, and the Duke of Monmouth in mighty rich clothes; but the well-ordering of the men I understand not.

1668-09-16 09:42   I find the Duke of York gone with the King to see the muster of the Guards in Hyde Park; and their Colonel, the Duke of Monmouth, to take his command this day of the King’s Life-Guard, by surrender of my Lord Gerard.

1668-09-16 08:48 r It is pretty here to see how the late Church was but a case wrought over the old Church; for you may see the very old pillars standing whole within the wall of this.

1668-09-16 08:43 r No hurt, I hear, is done yet, since their going to pull down the Church and steeple; but one man, on Monday this week, fell from the top to a piece of the roof, of the east end, that stands next the steeple, and there broke himself all to pieces.

1668-09-16 08:40 r I stopped, too, at Paul’s, and there did go into St. Fayth’s Church, and also in the body of the west part of the Church; and do see a hideous sight of the walls of the Church ready to fall, that I was in fear as long as I was in it.

1668-09-16 08:20   To St. James’s to the Duke of York, walking it to the Temple, and in my way observe that the Stockes are now pulled quite down; and it will make the coming into Cornhill and Lumber Street mighty noble.

1668-09-16 07:02   Up; and dressing myself I did begin para tocar the breasts of my maid Jane, which elle did give way to more than usual heretofore, so I have a design to try more when I can bring it to.

1668-09-15 17:24   By water to the King’s playhouse, to see a new play, acted but yesterday, a translation out of French by Dryden, called “The Ladys a la Mode”: so mean a thing as, when they come to say it would be acted again tomorrow, both he that said it, Beeson, and the pit fell a-laughing.

1668-09-15 08:12 r So walked back and saw them gone; and so home to the Office, where Mrs. Daniel come and staid talking to little purpose with me to borrow money but I did not lend her any, having not opportunity para hazer alieno thing mit her.

1668-09-15 06:03 r So took wife and Mercer and Deb. and W. Hewer (who are all to set out this day for Cambridge, to cozen Roger Pepys’s, to see Sturbridge Fayre); and I showed them the Exchange, which is very finely carried on, with good dispatch.

1668-09-15 05:35   Up mighty betimes, my wife and people, Mercer lying here all night, by three o’clock, and I about five; and they before, and I after them, to the coach in Bishopsgate Street, which was not ready to set out.

1668-09-14 22:10   Mrs. Turner comes to see my wife before her journey tomorrow, but she is in bed, and so sat talking to little purpose with me a great while, and, she gone, I to bed.

1668-09-14 09:55 r I down with Mr. Wren; and he and I read all over that I had, and I expounded them to him, and did so order it that I had them home with me, so that I shall, to my heart’s wish, be able to take a copy of them.

1668-09-14 08:50   I by coach to St. James’s, where I find Sir W. Pen and Lord Anglesey, who delivered his answer to the Duke of York, but I could not see it.

1668-09-14 06:53 r But no hurt, I hear, hath yet happened in all this work of the steeple, which is very much.

1668-09-14 06:50   Up betimes, and walked to the Temple, and stopped, viewing the Exchange, and Paul’s, and St. Fayth’s, where strange how the very sight of the stones falling from the top of the steeple do make me sea-sick!

1668-09-13 22:10 r My mind is mightily pleased by this, if I can but get time to have a copy taken of them, for my future use; but I must return them tomorrow. So to bed.

1668-09-13 21:05 r Little said reflective on me, though W. Pen and J. Minnes do mean me in one or two places, and J. Minnes a little more plainly would lead the Duke of York to question the exactness of my keeping my records; but all to no purpose.

1668-09-13 20:55 r Took a hackney and home, and after supper made my wife to read them all over, wherein she is mighty useful to me; and I find them all evasions, and in many things false, and in few, to the full purpose.

1668-09-13 17:36 r So having no opportunity of talk with the Duke of York, and Mr. Wren some business to do, he put them into my hands like an idle companion, to take home with me before himself had read them, which do give me great opportunity of altering my answer, if there was cause.

1668-09-13 17:20   To St. James’s, and met, to my wish, the Duke of York and Mr. Wren; and understand the Duke of York hath received answers from Brouncker, W. Pen, and J. Minnes; and as soon as he saw me, he bid Mr. Wren read them over with me.

1668-09-12 11:00   I do see great whispering among my brethren about their replies to the Duke of York, which vexed me, though I know no reason for it; for I have no manner of ground to fear them.

1668-09-11 17:47   All the afternoon in my house with Batelier shut up, drawing up my defence to the Duke of York upon his great letter, which I have industriously taken this opportunity of doing for my future use.

1668-09-10 22:20 r So being good friends again, my wife seeking, it, by my being silent I overcoming her, we to bed.

1668-09-10 18:55 r Here we at Unthanke’s ’light, and walked them to White Hall, my wife mighty angry at it, and did give me ill words before Batelier, which vexed me, but I made no matter of it, but vexed to myself.

1668-09-10 18:10 r To Unthanke’s, and ’Change, where wife did a little business, while Mercer and I staid in the coach; and, in a quarter of an hour, I taught her the whole Larke’s song perfectly, so excellent an eare she hath.

1668-09-10 17:04   I and W. Howe, who come to see me, by water to the Temple, and met our four women, my wife, M. Batelier, Mercer, and Deb., at the Duke’s play-house, and there saw “The Maid in the Mill,” revived — a pretty, harmless old play.

1668-09-09 22:04   After a little supper, vexed, and spending a little time melancholy in making a base to the Lark’s song, I to bed.

1668-09-09 15:50   To White Hall, where Brouncker, W. Pen, and I attended the Commissioners of the Treasury about the victualling-contract, where high words between Sir Thomas Clifford and us, and myself more particularly, who told him that something was a flat untruth.

1668-09-09 11:48 r His business was about his yacht, and he seems a mighty good-natured man, and did presently write me a warrant for a doe from Cobham, when the season comes, bucks season being past. I shall make much of this acquaintance, that I may live to see his lady near.

1668-09-09 10:58   I find the Duke of Richmond at his lodgings in the little building in the bowling-green, at White Hall, that was begun to be built by Captain Rolt. They are fine rooms. I did hope to see his lady, the beautiful Mrs. Stuart, but she, I hear, is in the country.

1668-09-08 17:52   I received two letters from the Duke of Richmond about his yacht, which is newly taken into the King’s service, and I am glad of it, hoping hereby to oblige him, and to have occasions of seeing his noble Duchess, which I admire.

1668-09-08 14:40   I received so earnest an invitation again from Roger Pepys, to come to Sturbridge-Fair that I resolve to let my wife go, which she shall do the next week.

1668-09-08 09:04   To St. James’s, there to talk a little with Mr. Wren about the private business we are upon, in the Office, where he tells me he finds that they all suspect me to be the author of the great letter, which I value not.

1668-09-07 17:04   I with Lord Brouncker (who was this day in an unusual manner merry, I believe with drink), J. Minnes, and W. Pen to Bartholomew-Fair; and there saw the dancing mare again, which, today, I find to act much worse than the other day, she forgetting many things.

1668-09-06 22:10 r My boy was with me, and read to me all day, and we sang a while together, and so home to supper a little, and so to bed.

1668-09-06 20:57 r I took boat again the beginning of the flood, and come home by nine at night, with much pleasure, it being a fine day.

1668-09-06 16:10 r I did go with Mr. Hosier to his lodging, and there did see his wife, a pretty tolerable woman, and do find him upon an extraordinary good work of designing a method of keeping our Storekeeper’s Accounts, in the Navy.

1668-09-06 13:55 r Going down I spent reading of the “Five Sermons of Five Several Styles,” worth comparing one with another: but I do think, when all is done, that, contrary to the design of the book, the Presbyterian style and the Independent are the best of the five sermons to be preached in.

1668-09-06 13:20   Took boat with Henry Russell to Gravesend where, at the Ship, I dined; and thither come to me Mr. Hosier, whom I went to speak with, about several businesses of work that he is doing, and I would have him do, of writing work, for me.

1668-09-05 20:20   By coach to Mr. Hales’s new house, where he hath finished my wife’s hand, which is better than the other; and here I find Harris’s picture, done in his habit of “Henry the Fifth;” mighty like a player, but I do not think the picture near so good as any yet he hath made for me.

1668-09-05 19:03   Up, and at the office all the morning. At noon home to dinner, and to the office to work all the afternoon again till the evening.

1668-09-04 21:50 r This night Knepp tells us that there is a Spanish woman lately come over, that pretends to sing as well as Mrs. Knight; both of which I must endeavour to hear.

1668-09-04 20:22 r And here Knepp come to us, and sat with us, and thence took coach in two coaches, and losing one another, my wife, and Knepp, and I to Hercules Pillars, and there supped, and I did take from her mouth the words and notes of her song of “the Larke,” which pleases me mightily.

1668-09-04 16:48 r Which we did, and it is an excellent play; the more I see it, the more I love the wit of it; only the business of abusing the Puritans begins to grow stale, and of no use, they being the people that, at last, will be found the wisest.

1668-09-04 14:30   My wife, and Deb., and Mercer, and W. Hewer and I to the Fair, and there, at the old house, did eat a pig, and was pretty merry, but saw no sights, my wife having a mind to see the play “Bartholomew-Fayre,” with puppets.

1668-09-03 14:10   To my bookseller’s for “Hobbs’s Leviathan,” which is now mightily called for; and what was heretofore sold for 8s. I now give 24s. for, at the second hand, and is sold for 30s., it being a book the Bishops will not let be printed again.
