1668-08-21 20:04   To Reeves’s, and bought a reading-glass, and so to my bookseller’s again, there to buy a Book of Martyrs, which I did agree for; and so, after seeing and beginning acquaintance con his femme, but very little, away home.

1668-08-21 18:12   This day I did first see the Duke of York’s room of pictures of some Maids of Honour, done by Lilly: good, but not like.

1668-08-21 16:13 r A silly piece of ceremony, Colbert saying only a few formal words. A comely man, and in a black suit and cloak of silk, which is a strange fashion, now it hath been so long left off.

1668-08-21 16:11   To St. James’s, where did a little ordinary business; and by and by comes Monsieur Colbert, the French Embassador, to make his first visit to the Duke of York, and then to the Duchess, and I saw it.

1668-08-21 13:45   So back home and to the ’Change, in my way calling at Morris’, my vintner’s, where I love to see su moher, though no acquaintance accostais this day con her.

1668-08-21 13:10   Up, and with my people again to work and finished all before noon: and then I by water to White Hall, and there did tell the Duke of York that I had done; and he hath desired me to come to him at Sunday next, to read it over, by which I have more time to consider and correct it.

1668-08-21 00:03 r At it till past twelve at night, that I might get my great letter to the Duke of York ready against tomorrow, which I shall do, to my great content.

1668-08-20 14:03   Betimes at my business again, and so to the office, and dined with Brouncker and J. Minnes, at Sir W. Pen’s at a bad pasty of venison, and so to work again.

1668-08-19 21:20 r I am vexed also to be told by W. Hewer that he is summoned to the Commissioners of Accounts about receiving a present of 30l. from Mr. Mason, the timber merchant, though there be no harm in it, he having done them several lawful kindnesses and never demanded anything.

1668-08-19 20:52 r I, and my wife, and W. Hewer called them to us, and there I did examine all the thing, and them, in league. She in love, and he hath got her to promise him to marry, and he is now cold in it, so that I must rid my hands of them, which troubles me.

1668-08-19 19:49   Being busy above, a great cry I hear, and go down; and what should it be but Jane, in a fit of direct raving, which lasted half-an-hour. Beyond four or five of our strength to keep her down; and, when all come to all, a fit of jealousy about Tom, with whom she is in love.

1668-08-19 17:59   This week my people wash, over the water, and so I little company at home.

1668-08-19 17:42   Up betimes, and all day and afternoon without going out, busy upon my great letter to the Duke of York, which goes on to my content. W. Hewer and Gibson I employ with me in it.

1668-08-18 23:47   Yo did hazer Deb tocar mi thing with her hand after yo was in lecto — with great pleasure.

1668-08-18 22:57 r So back to White Hall and there took water, and so home, and busy late about my great letter to the Duke of York, and so to supper and to bed.

1668-08-18 19:04   I took coach alone to the Park; among the few coaches there were in two coaches our two great beauties, my Lady Castlemayne and Richmond; the first time I saw the latter since she had the smallpox. I had much pleasure to see them, but I thought they were strange one to another.

1668-08-17 22:50   Home, and there with Mr. Hater and W. Hewer late, reading over all the principal officers’ instructions in order to my great work upon my hand, and so to bed, my eyes very ill.

1668-08-17 17:22   To the Duke of York’s house, and there saw “Cupid’s Revenge,” under the new name of “Love Despised,” that hath something very good in it, though I like not the whole body of it. This day the first time acted here.

1668-08-17 14:15 r To Mr. Chichley’s by invitation, and there dined with Sir John, his father not coming home. And while at dinner comes by the French Embassador Colbert’s mules, the first I ever saw, with their sumpter-clothes mighty rich, and his coaches, he being to have his entry today.

1668-08-17 10:32 r After a little talk about our business of Ackeworth, went and saw the Lord Wotton’s house and garden, which is wonderfull fine: too good for the house the gardens are, being, indeed, the most noble that ever I saw, and brave orange and lemon trees.

1668-08-17 09:55   Up, and by water to White Hall, and so to St. James’s, and thence with Mr. Wren by appointment in his coach to Hampstead, to speak with the Atturney-general, whom we met in the fields, by his old route and house.

1668-08-16 21:10 r At noon to dinner, and again with W. Hewer to work all the afternoon till night, till I was weary and had despatched a good deal of business.

1668-08-16 12:10   All the morning at my Office with W. Hewer, there drawing up my Report to the Duke of York, as I have promised, about the faults of this Office, hoping thereby to have opportunity of doing myself something.

1668-08-15 17:37   With my wife, Mercer, and Deb., to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “Love’s Mistresse” revived, the thing pretty good, but full of variety of divertisement.

1668-08-14 18:10 r The Office met this afternoon as usual, and waited on the Duke of York; where, among other things, he talked a great while of his intentions of going to Dover soon, to be sworn as Lord Warden, which is a matter of great ceremony and state.

1668-08-14 16:20   I to the Duke of York, who enquired for what I had promised him, about my observations of the miscarriages of our Office; and I told him he should have it next week, being glad he called for it; for I find he is concerned to do something, and to secure himself thereby I believe.

1668-08-14 14:20   I with Mr. Wren, by invitation, to Sir Stephen Fox’s to dinner, where the Cofferer and Sir Edward Savage; where many good stories of the antiquity and estates of many families at this day in Cheshire, and that part of the kingdom, more than what is on this side, near London.

1668-08-14 10:42   At home I find Symson, putting up my new chimney-piece, in our great chamber, which is very fine, but will cost a great deal of money, but it is not flung away.

1668-08-14 09:20 r I told him also what Cocke told me, but he says there is not much in it, though he do know that this hath been in the eye of some persons to compass for the turning all things in the navy, and that it looks so like a popular thing as that he thinks something may be done in it.

1668-08-14 09:00   Up, and by water to White Hall and St. James’s, and to see Sir W. Coventry, and discourse about business of our Office, telling him my trouble there, to see how things are ordered.

1668-08-13 22:32   So to the Office again all the afternoon till night, very busy, and so with much content home, and made my wife sing and play on the flageolet to me till I slept with great pleasure in bed.

1668-08-13 14:04   To dinner, where W. Howe dined with me, who tells me for certain that Creed is like to speed in his match with Mrs. Betty Pickering. Here dined with me also Mr. Hollier, who is mighty vain in his pretence to talk Latin.

1668-08-13 09:10   Up, and Greeting comes, and there he and I tried some things of Mr. Locke’s for two flageolets, to my great content, and this day my wife begins again to learn of him; for I have a great mind for her to be able to play a part with me.

1668-08-12 22:34   I to the office, and then come Mrs. Turner and her husband to advise about their son, the Chaplain, who is turned out of his ship, a sorrow to them, which I am troubled for, and do give them the best advice I can, and so they gone we to bed.

1668-08-12 18:36   I, and wife, and Mercer, and Deb., to the Duke of York’s house, and saw “Mackbeth,” to our great content, and then home, where the women went to the making of my tubes.

1668-08-12 11:47   Captain Cocke tells me that the Duke of York will lose the authority of an Admiral, and be governed by a Committee: and all our Office changed; only they are in dispute whether I shall continue or no, which puts new thoughts in me, but I know not whether to be glad or sorry.

1668-08-12 11:30   To the Excise Office, and so to the Temple to take counsel about Major Nicholls’s business for the King. So to several places about business, and among others to Drumbleby’s about the mouths for my paper tubes, and so to the ’Change and home.

1668-08-11 21:47   This afternoon my wife, and Mercer, and Deb., went with Pelling to see the gypsies at Lambeth, and have their fortunes told; but what they did, I did not enquire.

1668-08-11 21:30   To the great joy of the Nonconformists, the time is out of the Act against them, so that they may meet: and they have declared that they will have a morning lecture up again, which is pretty strange; and they are connived at by the King every where, I hear, in City and country.

1668-08-11 20:52   At the Office all the afternoon till night, being mightily pleased with a little trial I have made of the use of a tube-spectacall of paper, tried with my right eye.

1668-08-11 10:27   To Westminster Hall, where the Parliament met enough to adjourne, which they did, to the 10th of November next.

1668-08-11 08:30   Up, and by water to Sir W. Coventry to visit him, whom I find yet troubled at the Commissioners of Accounts, about this business of Sir W. Warren, which is a ridiculous thing, and can come to nothing but contempt.

1668-08-10 22:04   Home to supper, and my wife to read a ridiculous book I bought today of the History of the Taylors’ Company, and all the while Deb. did comb my head, and I did tocar her with my mano para mi great pleasure, and so to bed.

1668-08-10 17:34 r But it is most certainly a most rare piece of work, as to the painting. He hath 30l. for his work — and the crystal, and case, and gold case comes to 8l. 3s. 4d.; and which I sent him this night, that I might be out of debt.

1668-08-10 17:32   To Cooper’s, where I spent all the afternoon with my wife and girl, seeing him make an end of her picture, which he did to my great content, though not so great as, I confess, I expected, being not satisfied in the greatness of the resemblance, nor in the blue garment.

1668-08-10 14:52   To Westminster Hall, and so by coach to the old Exchange, and there did several businesses, and so home to dinner, and then abroad to Duck Lane, where I saw my belle femme of the book vendor, but had no opportunity para hazer con her.

1668-08-10 09:42 r My Lord Orrery took notice of me, and begun discourse of hangings, and of the improvement of shipping: I not thinking that he knew me, but did then discover it, with a mighty compliment of my abilities and ingenuity, which I am mighty proud of; and he do speak most excellently.

1668-08-10 09:10   To my Lord Arlington’s house, the first time I there since he come thither, at Goring House, a very fine, noble place; and there he received me in sight of several Lords with great respect. I did give him an account of my journey.

1668-08-09 22:22   And so home to supper, and to set my books a little right, and then to bed. This day Betty Michell come and dined with us, the first day after her lying in, whom I was glad to see.

1668-08-09 18:20   After dinner, I took my wife and Deb. round by Hackney, and up and down to take the ayre; and then home, and made visits to Mrs. Turner, and Mrs. Mercer, and Sir W. Pen, who is come from Epsom not well, and Sir J. Minnes, who is not well neither.

1668-08-09 11:45   With Mr. Slingsby, to Mrs. Williams’s, thinking to dine with Lord Brouncker there, but did not, having promised my wife to come home, though here I met Knepp, to my great content.

1668-08-09 09:40   Got John Powell’s coach, and he attended me at St. James’s, where waited on the Duke of York; and both by him and several of the Privy-Council, beyond expectation, I find that my going to Sir Thomas Allen was looked upon as a thing necessary: and I have got some advantage by it.

1668-08-08 22:10 r I hear that Colbert, the French Ambassador, is come, and hath been at Court incognito. When he hath his audience, I know not.

1668-08-08 22:03 r We home to Fox Hall, where Fitzgerald and I ’light, and by water to White Hall, where the Duke of York being abroad, I by coach and met my wife, who went round, and after doing at the office a little, and finding all well at home, I to bed.

1668-08-08 14:32 r But here I saw my aunt, after many days not seeing her — I think, a year or two; and she walked with me to see my wife. And here, at the Red Lyon, we all dined together, and mighty merry, and then parted.

1668-08-08 10:12   I walked out, and met Uncle Wight, whom I sent to last night, and Mr. Wight coming to see us, and I walked with them back to see my aunt at Katherine Hill, and there walked up and down the hill and places, about: but a dull place, but good ayre, and the house dull.

1668-08-07 22:03 r Come at night to Gilford, where the Red Lyon so full of people, and a wedding, that the master of the house did get us a lodging over the way, at a private house, his landlord’s, mighty neat and fine; and there supped and talked with the landlord and his wife.

1668-08-07 19:42 r Fitzgerald with us, whom I was pleased with all the day, with his discourse of his observations abroad, as being a great soldier and of long standing abroad: and knows all things and persons abroad very well — I mean, the great soldiers of France, and Spain, and Germany.

1668-08-07 14:30 r Then to dinner, and pretty merry: and here was Mr. Martin, the purser, and dined with us, and wrote some things for us. And so took coach again back.

1668-08-07 11:20 r Sir Thomas Allen wishes all we are told be true; for he finds that the Turks have been very civil to our merchant-men everywhere; and, if they would have broke with us, they never had such an opportunity over our rich merchant-men, as lately, coming out of the Streights.

1668-08-07 11:11 r We four sat down presently to our business, and in an hour despatched all our talk; and did inform Sir Thomas Allen well in it, who, I perceive, in serious matters, is a serious man.

1668-08-07 10:10   Up, and to coach, and with a guide to Petersfield, where I find Sir Thomas Allen and Mr. Tippets come; the first about the business, the latter only in respect to me; as also Fitzgerald, who come post all last night, and newly arrived here.

1668-08-06 22:02 r So to coach again, and got to Lippock, late over Hindhead, having an old man, a guide, in the coach with us; but got thither with great fear of being out of our way.

1668-08-06 16:12 r At Gilford we dined; and, I showed them the hospitall there of Bishop Abbot’s, and his tomb in the church, which, and the rest of the tombs there, are kept mighty clean and neat, with curtains before them.

1668-08-06 12:10 r Over the water to Fox Hall; and there my wife and Deb. come and took me up, and we away to Gilford, losing our way for three or four mile, about Cobham.

1668-08-06 08:40 r The Duke of York did tell me of it: it is about a quarrel between him and Witham, and they fear a challenge: so I to him, and sent my wife by the coach round to Lambeth.

1668-08-06 06:20 r But, before ready, comes a letter from Fitzgerald, that he is seized upon last night by an order of the General’s by a file of musqueteers, and kept prisoner in his chamber.

1668-08-06 05:30   Waked betimes, and my wife, at an hour’s warning, is resolved to go with me, which pleases me, her readiness.

1668-08-05 22:20   I away home, and there bespeak a coach; and so home and to bed, my wife being abroad with the Mercers walking in the fields, and upon the water.

1668-08-05 20:44   With Fitzgerald to a tavern, to consider of the instructions for Sir Thomas Allen, against his going to Algiers; he and I being designed to go down to Portsmouth by the Council’s order, and by and by he and I went to the Duke of York, who orders me to go down tomorrow morning.

1668-08-05 17:30   To the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there saw “The Guardian;” formerly the same, I find, that was called “Cutter of Coleman Street;” a silly play.

1668-08-05 09:10   Up about seven and to White Hall, where read over my report to Lord Arlington and Berkeley, and then at the Council Board with great good liking, but, Lord! how it troubled my eyes, though I did not think I could have done it, but did do it, and was not very bad afterward.

1668-08-05 02:04   I with my clerks and another of Lord Brouncker’s, Seddon, sat up till two in the morning, drawing up my answers and writing them fair, which did trouble me mightily to sit up so long, because of my eyes.

1668-08-04 14:40   To the office, where come to me my Lord Bellassis, Lieutenant-Colonell Fitzgerald, newly come from Tangier, and Sir Arthur Basset, and there I received their informations.

1668-08-04 09:20   To White Hall about a Committee for Tangier at my Lord Arlington’s, where, by Creed’s being out of town, I have the trouble given me of drawing up answers to the complaints of the Turks of Algiers, and so I have all the papers put into my hand.

1668-08-03 22:10 r And so back to them and took them out to Islington, where we met with W. Joyce and his wife and boy, and there eat and drank, and a great deal of his idle talk, and so we round by Hackney home, and so to sing a little in the garden, and then to bed.

1668-08-03 15:08   Home to dinner, and so, Mercer dining with us, I took my wife and her and Deb. out to Unthanke’s, while I to White Hall to the Commissioners of the Treasury.

1668-08-03 13:20   To St. James’s, where I did much business and, meeting Dr. Gibbons, carried him to the Sun tavern, in King Street, and there made him, and some friends of his, drink; among others, Captain Silas Taylor, and here did get Gibbons to promise me some things for my flageolets.

1668-08-02 20:20 r Thence walked to Barne Elmes, and there, and going and coming, did make the boy read to me several things, being now-a-days unable to read myself anything, for above two lines together, but my eyes grow weary.

1668-08-02 16:30   After dinner, I and Tom, my boy, by water up to Putney, and there heard a sermon, and many fine people in the church.

1668-08-02 12:05   Up and at home all the morning, hanging, and removing of some pictures, in my study and house.

1668-08-01 17:45   After dinner my wife, and Deb., and I, to the King’s house again, coming too late yesterday to hear the prologue, and do like the play better now than before; and, indeed, there is a great deal of true wit in it, more than in the common sort of plays.
