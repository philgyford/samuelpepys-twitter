1668-11-08 22:20 r I could wish in that respect that the girl was out of the house, for our peace is broke to all of us while she is here, and so to bed, where my wife mighty unquiet, so as my bed is become burdensome to me.

1668-11-08 21:10 r As pleasant as we can we supped together, and so made the boy read to me, the poor girl not appearing at supper, but hid herself in her chamber.

1668-11-08 20:31 r At my chamber again to work all the afternoon till night, when Pelling comes, who wonders to find my wife so dull and melancholy, but God knows she hath too much cause.

1668-11-08 12:05   To dinner, the girl with us, but my wife troubled thereat to see her, and do tell me so, which troubles me, for I love the girl.

1668-11-07 19:28   I did go out towards Sir D. Gawden’s, thinking to have bespoke a place for my coach and horses at the Victualling Office; but find the way so bad and long that I returned, and looked for places elsewhere, in an inne, which I hope to get with more convenience than there.

1668-11-07 18:40   At the office all the morning, and so to it again after dinner, and there busy late, choosing to employ myself rather than go home to trouble with my wife, whom, however, I am forced to comply with, and indeed I do pity her as having cause enough for her grief.

1668-11-06 17:13 r At last did pitch upon a little chariott, whose body was framed, but not covered, at the widow’s, that made Mr. Lowther’s fine coach; and we are mightily pleased with it, it being light, and will be very genteel and sober: to be covered with leather, and yet will hold four.

1668-11-06 17:02 r Thence with Mr. Povy spent all the afternoon going up and down among the coachmakers in Cow Lane, and did see several.

1668-11-06 14:10 r I was mightily pleased with this company and their discourse, so as to have been seldom so much in all my life, and so after dinner up into his upper room, and there did see a piece of perspective, but much inferior to Mr. Povy’s.

1668-11-06 13:40 r Here much extraordinary noble discourse of foreign princes, and particularly the greatness of the King of France, and of his being fallen into the right way of making the kingdom great, which [none] of his ancestors ever did before.

1668-11-06 13:25 r And so away, and to the Swedes Agent’s, and there met Mr. Povy; where the Agent would have me stay and dine, there being only them, and Joseph Williamson, and Sir Thomas Clayton; but what he is I know not.

1668-11-06 12:35 r There I met with Sir Robert Holmes, and he invited me and would have me go to dine with him at the Treasurer’s, Sir Thomas Clifford, where I did go and eat some oysters; which while we were at, in comes my Lord Keeper and much company; and so I thought it best to withdraw.

1668-11-06 11:45   I took coach and to Mr. Povy’s, where I hear he is gone to the Swede’s Resident in Covent Garden, where he is to dine. I went thither, but he is not come yet, so I to White Hall to look for him.

1668-11-06 10:50 r I up and down the house to hear news: and there every body’s mouth full of changes; and, among others, the Duke of York’s regiment of Guards, that was raised during the late war at sea, is to be disbanded.

1668-11-06 10:04 r We did conclude upon answers to my mind for the Board, and that that, if put in execution, will do the King’s business. But I do now perceive the Duke of York’s trouble, and that he do lie under great weight of mind from the Duke of Buckingham’s carrying things against him.

1668-11-06 09:40   I to White Hall, and there all of us to wait on the Duke of York, which we did, having little to do. By and by the Duke of York did come to his closet; and there my paper, that I have lately taken pains to draw up, was read, and the Duke of York pleased therewith.

1668-11-05 16:55 r Home by coach, with my mind troubled and finding no content, my wife being still troubled, nor can be at peace while the girl is there, which I am troubled at on the other side.

1668-11-05 15:33 r With him to see my cozen Turner and The., and there sat and talked, they being newly come out of the country; and here pretty merry, and with The. to shew her a coach at Mr. Povy’s man’s, she being in want of one.

1668-11-05 14:15   By coach to see Roger Pepys at his lodgings; and there I did see a book, which my Lord Sandwich hath promised one to me of, “A Description of the Escuriall in Spain;” which I have a great desire to have, though I took it for a finer book when he promised it me.

1668-11-05 12:33   At the office all the morning, and so to dinner, my wife with me, but so as I durst not look upon the girl, though, God knows, notwithstanding all my protestations I could not keep my mind from desiring it.

1668-11-05 07:45   Up, and presently my wife up with me, which she professedly now do every day to dress me, that I may not see Willet, and do eye me, whether I cast my eye upon her, or no; and do keep me from going into the room where she is among the upholsters at work in our blue chamber.

1668-11-04 21:42   My wife and I spent much time talking of our being put out of the Office, and my going to live at Deptford at her brother’s, till I can clear my accounts, and rid my hands of the town, which will take me a year or more, and I do think it will be best for me to do so.

1668-11-04 21:00   A boy is sent me out of the country from Impington by my cozen Roger Pepys’ getting, whom I visited this morning at his chamber in the Strand and carried him to Westminster Hall, where I took a turn or two with him and Sir John Talbot, who talks mighty high for my Lord of Ormond.

1668-11-04 20:30   When I come home I find Deb. not come home, and do doubt whether she be not quite gone or no, but my wife is silent to me in it, and I to her, and am well satisfied that my house will never be at peace between my wife and I unless I let her go, though it grieves me to the heart.

1668-11-04 10:12 r That, that pleases me most is, that Pen is to be removed; and that he hath resigned his place; and particularly Spragg tells me for certain that he hath resigned it, and is become a partner with Gawden in the Victualling: in which I think he hath done a very cunning thing.

1668-11-04 10:10 r That, that troubles me most is, that they begin to talk that the Duke of York’s regiment is ordered to be disbanded; and that undoubtedly his Admiralty will follow: which do shake me mightily, and I fear will have ill consequences in the nation, for these counsels are very mad.

1668-11-04 09:55 r The two new Treasurers did kiss the King’s hand this morning, brought in by my Lord Arlington. They walked up and down together the Court this day, and several people joyed them; but I avoided it, that I might not be seen to look either way.

1668-11-04 09:15   To White Hall; and there I find the King and Duke of York come the last night, and every body’s mouth full of my Lord Anglesey’s suspension being sealed; which it was, it seems, yesterday; so that he is prevented in his remedy at the Council.

1668-11-04 00:45 r My wife did tell me that the only way is to put things out of sight, and this I know she means by Deb, for she tells me that her Aunt was here, and she did tell her of her desire of parting with Deb, but in such kind terms on both sides that my wife is mightily taken with her.

1668-11-04 00:17 r To my grief I did see the poor wretch look on me and see me look on her, and then let drop a tear or two, which do make my heart relent at this minute that I am writing this with great trouble of mind, for she is indeed my sacrifice, poor girl.

1668-11-04 00:15   So home, and there to supper, and I observed my wife to eye my eyes whether I did ever look upon Deb., which I could not but do now and then.

1668-11-03 23:57   To the Office, and there busy till 12 at night, without much pain to my eyes, but I did not use them to read or write, and so did hold out very well.

1668-11-03 11:11   We had a great deal of do at the Office about Clutterbucke, I declaring my dissent against the whole Board’s proceedings, and I believe I shall go near to shew W. Pen a very knave in it, whatever I find my Lord Brouncker.

1668-11-02 21:25   This day I went, by Mr. Povy’s direction, to a coachmaker near him, for a coach just like his, but it was sold this very morning.

1668-11-02 15:10   After dinner up, and looked up and down the house, and so to the cellar; and thence I slipt away, without taking leave, and so to a few places about business, and so home, where the house still full of dirt by painters and others, and will not be clean a good while.

1668-11-02 13:40 r I was glad to see it: but sorry, methought, to see my Lord have so little reason to be merry, and yet glad, for his sake, to have him cheerful.

1668-11-02 13:20   So to Mr. Povy’s to talk about a coach, but there I find my Lord Sandwich, and Peterborough, and Hinchingbroke, Charles Harbord, and Sidney Montagu; and there I was stopped, and dined mighty nobly at a good table, with one little dish at a time upon it, but mighty merry.

1668-11-02 09:10   Up, and a cold morning, by water through bridge without a cloak, and there to Mr. Wren at his chamber at White Hall, and he and I did read over my paper that I have with so much labour drawn up about the answers of the officers of this Office to the Duke of York’s reflections.

1668-11-01 22:20 r I think that it will be fit that she should be gone, for my wife’s peace and mine, for she cannot but be offended at the sight of her, my wife having conceived this jealousy of me with reason, and therefore it will be best to let her go, but I shall love and pity her.

1668-11-01 22:18   And so to supper and to bed, my mind yet at disquiet that I cannot be informed how poor Deb. stands with her mistress, but I fear she will put her away.

1668-11-01 17:00   Mr. Povy sent his coach for my wife and I to see, which we like mightily, and will endeavour to have him get us just such another.

1668-11-01 15:15   With W. Hewer at my chamber all this morning, going further in my great business for the Duke of York, and so at noon to dinner, and then W. Hewer to write fair what he had writ, till anon Mr. Gibson come, and he and I to perfect it to my full mind.
