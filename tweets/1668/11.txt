1668-11-20 21:48 r For I do find that it is much the best for my soul and body to live pleasing to God and my poor wife, and will ease me of much care as well as much expense.

1668-11-20 21:32   I did this night promise to my wife never to go to bed without calling upon God upon my knees by prayer, and I begun this night, and hope I shall never forget to do the like all my life.

1668-11-20 21:10   Mr. Billing being gone, I to my wife again, and so spent the evening with very great joy.

1668-11-20 16:30   Comes Mr. Billup to me, to read over Mr. Wren’s alterations of my draught of a letter for the Duke of York to sign, to the Board; which I like mighty well, they being not considerable, only in mollifying some hard terms, which I had thought fit to put in.

1668-11-20 14:45 r This pleased my wife, and she gives it W. Hewer to carry to Deb. with a sharp message from her. So from that minute my wife begun to be kind to me, and we to kiss and be friends.

1668-11-20 14:24 r My wife would not be satisfied till, W. Hewer winking upon me, I did write so with the name of a whore as that I did fear she might too probably have been prevailed upon to have been a whore by her carriage to me, and therefore as such I did resolve never to see her more.

1668-11-20 14:18 r Which I did agree to, only as to the name of whore I would have excused, and therefore wrote to her sparing that word, which my wife thereupon tore it.

1668-11-20 14:10 r At last it come to this, that if I would call Deb. whore under my hand and write to her that I hated her, and would never see her more, my wife would believe me and trust in me.

1668-11-20 13:28 r At last W. Hewer come in and come up, who did allay my wife’s fury, I flinging myself, in a sad desperate condition, upon the bed in the blue room, and there lay while they spoke together.

1668-11-20 12:58 r So I by silence and weeping did prevail with her a little to be quiet, and she would not eat her dinner without me; but yet by and by into a raging fit she fell again, worse than before, that she would slit the girl’s nose.

1668-11-20 12:30 r Rising, my wife did fall to revile me in the bitterest manner in the world, and could not refrain to strike me and pull my hair, which I resolved to bear with, and had good reason to bear it.

1668-11-20 12:12 r But when I come home, hoping for a further degree of peace and quiet, I find my wife upon her bed in a horrible rage afresh, calling me all the bitter names.

1668-11-20 11:30 r I did also discourse the unfitness of my leaving of my employment now in many respects to go into the country, as my wife desires, but that I would labour to fit myself for it, which W. Hewer thoroughly understands, and do agree with me in it.

1668-11-20 11:12 r I did there enter into more talk about my wife and myself, and he did give me great assurance of several particular cases to which my wife had from time to time made him privy of her loyalty and truth to me after many and great temptations, and I believe them truly.

1668-11-20 10:58 r I took W. Hewer into St. James’s Park, and there he did tell me he had been with Deb., and found what I said about my manner of being with her true, and had given her advice as I desired.

1668-11-20 10:20 r I did get W. Hewer to go to Deb. to tell her that I had told my wife all of my being with her the other night, that so if my wife should send she might not make the business worse by denying it.

1668-11-20 09:44 r He is, I think, so honest and true a servant to us both, and one that loves us, that I was not much troubled at his being privy to all this, but rejoiced in my heart that I had him to assist in the making us friends, which he did truly and heartily.

1668-11-20 09:38 r We landed at the Temple, and there I bid W. Hewer call at my cozen Roger Pepys’s lodgings, and I staid in the street for him, and so to White Hall, in my way I telling him plainly and truly my resolutions, if I can get over this evil, never to give new occasion for it.

1668-11-20 08:14 r My wife do plainly declare that she dares not trust me out alone, and therefore made it a piece of our league that I should alway take somebody with me, or her herself, which I am mighty willing to, being, by the grace of God, resolved never to do her wrong more.

1668-11-20 08:10 r Up, with mighty kind words between my poor wife and I; and so to White Hall by water, W. Hewer with me, who is to go with me every where, until my wife be in condition to go out along with me herself.

1668-11-19 23:02 r This night the upholsters did finish the hanging of my best chamber, but my sorrow and trouble is so great about this business, that it puts me out of all joy in looking upon it or minding how it was.

1668-11-19 22:52 r I did this night begin to pray to God upon my knees alone in my chamber, which God knows I cannot yet do heartily; but I hope God will give me the grace more and more every day to fear Him, and to be true to my poor wife.

1668-11-19 22:20 r There being no curse in the world so great as this of the differences between myself and my wife, and therefore I do, by the grace of God, promise never to offend her more.

1668-11-19 22:02 r So, before it was late, there was, beyond my hopes as well as desert, a durable peace; and so to supper, and pretty kind words, and to bed, and there yo did hazer con ella to her content.

1668-11-19 19:15 r The poor fellow did cry like a child, and obtained that she would be pacified upon condition that I would give it under my hand never to see Deb, as I did with Pierce and Knepp, which I did also promise for Deb. too, but I have the confidence to deny it to the perjury of myself.

1668-11-19 18:09 r So with most perfect confusion of face and heart, and sorrow and shame, in the greatest agony in the world I did pass this afternoon, fearing that it will never have an end; but at last I did call for W. Hewer, who I was forced to make privy now to all.

1668-11-19 17:15 r And she did there demand 3 or 400l. of me to buy my peace, that she might be gone without making any noise, or else protested that she would make all the world know of it.

1668-11-19 16:34 r What was worse, my wife swore by all that was good that she would slit the nose of this girl, and be gone herself this very night from me.

1668-11-19 16:21 r But at last did, for the ease of my mind and hers, and for ever to discharge my heart of this wicked business, I did confess all, and above stairs in our bed chamber there I did endure the sorrow of her threats and vows and curses all the afternoon.

1668-11-19 12:12 r Which enquiring into the reason of, my wife begun to call me all the false, rotten-hearted rogues in the world, letting me understand that I was with Deb. yesterday, which, thinking it impossible for her ever to understand, I did a while deny.

1668-11-19 12:03 r Running up stairs to see the upholsters, who are at work upon hanging my best room, and setting up my new bed, I find my wife sitting sad in the dining room.

1668-11-19 11:45 r Up, and at the Office all the morning, with my heart full of joy to think in what a safe condition all my matters now stand between my wife and Deb, and me.

1668-11-18 22:37 r And so to supper and to bed, she having been mighty busy all day in getting of her house in order against tomorrow to hang up our new hangings and furnishing our best chamber.

1668-11-18 20:52 r And so home, and there told my wife a fair tale, God knows, how I spent the whole day, with which the poor wretch was satisfied, or at least seemed so.

1668-11-18 20:10 r Yo did give her 20s. and directions para laisser sealed in paper at any time the name of the place of her being at Herringman’s, by which I might go para her, and so bid her good night with much content to my mind, and resolution to look after her no more till I heard from her.

1668-11-18 19:42 r I did nevertheless give her the best council I could, to have a care of her honour, and to fear God, and suffer no man para haver to do con her as yo have done, which she promised.

1668-11-18 19:30 r She come into the coach, and yo did besar her and tocar her thing, but ella was against it and laboured with earnestness, such as I believe to be real. At last yo did make her tener mi cosa in her mano, while mi mano was sobra her pectus, and so did hazer with grand delight.

1668-11-18 18:32 r So I could not be commanded by my reason, but I must go this very night, and so by coach, it being now dark, I to her, close by my tailor’s.

1668-11-18 18:12 r He goes while I walk in Somerset House, walk there in the Court; at last he comes back and tells me she is well, and that I may see her if I will, but no more.

1668-11-18 17:15 r At last I told him my business was not with him, but a little gentlewoman, one Mrs. Willet, that is with him, and sent him to see how she did from her friend in London, and no other token.

1668-11-18 17:00 r And thence to the Strand, and towards night did meet with the porter that carried the chest of drawers with this Doctor, but he would not tell me where he lived, being his good master, he told me, but if I would have a message to him he would deliver it.

1668-11-18 15:38 r Thence back to White Hall to the Treasury a while.

1668-11-18 13:39 r Who by appointment comes to me to Hercules pillars, where I dined alone, but tells me that he cannot find out any such, but will enquire further.

1668-11-18 12:42 r I away and walked up and down the Strand between the two turnstiles, hoping to see Deb. out of a window, and then employed a porter, one Osbeston, to find out this Doctor’s lodgings thereabouts.

1668-11-18 12:12 r And the first I spoke with told me he knew him, and that he was newly gone into Lincoln’s Inn Fields, but whither he could not tell me, but that one of his fellows not then in the way did carry a chest of drawers thither with him, and that when he comes he would ask him.

1668-11-18 12:04 r For which God forgive me, for I was no sooner out about noon but I did go by coach directly to Somerset House, and there enquired among the porters there for Dr. Allbun.

1668-11-18 07:35 r Lay long in bed talking with my wife, she being unwilling to have me go abroad, saying and declaring herself jealous of my going out for fear of my going to Deb., which I do deny.

1668-11-17 20:50 r At my office all the afternoon and at night busy, and so home to my wife, and pretty pleasant, and at mighty ease in my mind, being in hopes to find Deb., and without trouble or the knowledge of my wife.

1668-11-17 12:12   My wife and maids busy now, to make clean the house above stairs, the upholsters having done there, in her closet and the blue room, and they are mighty pretty.

1668-11-16 13:35 r And so home, having eat nothing but two pennyworths of oysters, opened for me by a woman in the Strand, while the boy went to and again to inform me about this man, and therefore home and to dinner.

1668-11-16 12:45 r To Lincoln’s Inn Fields I went to Mr. Povy’s, but missed him, and so hearing only that this Allbon is gone to Fleet Street, I did only call at Martin’s, my bookseller’s, and there bought “Cassandra,” and some other French books for my wife’s closet.

1668-11-16 11:03 r And there not hearing of any such man as Allbon, with whom my wife said she now was, I to the Strand, and there by sending Drumbleby’s boy to Eagle Court, I find that this Dr. Allbon is a kind of poor broken fellow that dare not shew his head nor be known where he is gone.

1668-11-16 10:22 r I away to Holborne, about Whetstone’s Park, where I never was in my life before, where I understand by my wife’s discourse that Deb. is gone, which do trouble me mightily that the poor girl should be in a desperate condition forced to go thereabouts.

1668-11-15 22:01 r And so to supper and to bed, with my mind pretty quiet, and less troubled about Deb. than I was, though yet I am troubled, I must confess, and would be glad to find her out, though I fear it would be my ruin.

1668-11-15 19:11   There come to sit with us Mr. Pelling, who wondered to see my wife and I so dumpish, but yet it went off only as my wife’s not being well, and, poor wretch, she hath no cause to be well, God knows.

1668-11-15 16:35   Balty being come from the Downs, not very well, is come this day to see us, I to talk with him, and with some pleasure, hoping that he will make a good man.

1668-11-15 15:04   W. Howe to tell me what hath happened between him and the Commissioners of late, who are hot again about my Lord Sandwich’s business of prizes, which I am troubled for, and the more because of the great security and neglect with which, I think, my Lord do look upon this matter.

1668-11-15 09:30 r And so to the office to write down my journal for 6 or 7 days, my mind having been so troubled as never to get the time to do it before, as may appear a little by the mistakes I have made in this book within these few days.

1668-11-15 08:10 r Up, and after long lying with pleasure talking with my wife, and then up to look up and down our house, which will when our upholster hath done be mighty fine.

1668-11-15 06:30 r I must here remember that I have lain with my moher as a husband more times since this falling out than in I believe twelve months before. And with more pleasure to her than I think in all the time of our marriage before.

1668-11-14 20:14 r At the Office all the morning, and merry at noon, at dinner; and after dinner to the Office, where all the afternoon, doing much business, late. My mind being free of all troubles, I thank God, but only for my thoughts of this girl, which hang after her.

1668-11-14 08:06 r That is to say only in matters of pleasure, but in other things she will make her business to please me and to keep me right to her, which I will labour to be, for she deserves it of me, though it will be I fear a little time before I shall be able to wear Deb out of my mind.

1668-11-14 08:04 r And more troubled to see how my wife is by this means likely for ever to have her hand over me, that I shall for ever be a slave to her.

1668-11-14 07:50 r Word being brought presently up that Deb. was gone away by coach with her things, my wife was friends, and so all quiet, and I to the Office, with my heart sad, and find that I cannot forget the girl, and vexed I know not where to look for her.

1668-11-14 07:08 r Which she repeating and I vexed at it, answered her a little angrily, upon which she instantly flew out into a rage, calling me dog and rogue, and that I had a rotten heart; all which, knowing that I deserved it, I bore with.

1668-11-14 07:05 r My wife went down before me into the kitchen, and come up and told me that Deb. was in the kitchen, and therefore would have me go round the other way.

1668-11-14 06:50 r Up, and had a mighty mind to have seen or given Deb. a little money, to which purpose I wrapt up 40s. in paper, thinking to have given her a little money, but my wife rose presently, and would not let me be out of her sight.

1668-11-14 06:15 r And so to bed, and there, blessed be God! we did sleep well and with peace, which I had not done in now almost twenty nights together.

1668-11-13 22:04 r Before we went to bed my wife told me she would not have me to see Deb. or give her her wages, and so I did give my wife 10l. for her year and half a quarter’s wages, which she went into her chamber and paid her.

1668-11-13 21:35 r This troubled me, and the truth is, I have a good mind to have the maidenhead of this girl, which I should not doubt to have if yo could get time para be con her. But she will be gone and I not know whither.

1668-11-13 21:30   I home, and there to talk, with great pleasure all the evening, with my wife, who tells me that Deb. has been abroad today, and is come home and says she has got a place to go to, so as she will be gone tomorrow morning.

1668-11-13 16:45   I went to my coachmaker and Crow’s, and there saw things go on to my great content.

1668-11-13 16:07 r My Lord Keeper is utterly against putting away this and choosing another Parliament, lest they prove worse than this. My Lord Arlington know not which is best for him, being to seek whether this or the next will use him worst.

1668-11-13 16:05 r The Duke of Buckingham is against their meeting, as moved by his people, the people of the late times, who do never expect to have any thing done by this Parliament for their religion, and who do propose that, by the sale of the Church-lands, they shall put the King out of debt.

1668-11-13 16:03 r Mr. Wren told me, upon my several inquiries to that purpose, that he did believe it was not yet resolved whether the Parliament should ever meet more or no, the three great rulers of things now standing thus:

1668-11-13 15:20   To White Hall, and there staid in Mr. Wren’s chamber with him, reading over my draught of a letter, which Mr. Gibson then attended me with; and there he did like all, but doubted whether it would be necessary for the Duke to write in so sharp a style to the Office.

1668-11-13 13:10   I to the Three Tuns Tavern, by Charing Cross, and there dined with W. Pen, Sir J. Minnes, and Commissioner Middleton; and as merry as my mind could be, that hath so much trouble upon it at home.

1668-11-13 10:03   To the Commissioners of the Treasury, where I heard a case argued between my Lord Gerard and the Town of Newcastle, about a piece of ground which that Lord hath got a grant of, under the Exchequer Seal, which they were endeavouring to get of the King under the Great Seal.

1668-11-12 22:40   With Mr. Gibson late at my chamber making an end of my draught of a letter for the Duke of York, in answer to the answers of this Office, which I have now done to my mind, so as, if the Duke likes it, will put an end to a great deal of the faults of this Office.

1668-11-12 15:20   To my cozen Roger Pepys, who did move me as to the supplying him with 500l. this term, and 500l. the next, for two years, upon a mortgage, he having that sum to pay, a debt left him by his father, which I did agree to, trusting to his honesty and ability.

1668-11-12 14:34 r Which she took with tears too, but I believe understands me to be her friend, and I am apt to believe by what my wife hath of late told me is a cunning girl, if not a slut.

1668-11-12 14:32   I to my wife and to sit with her, and then called her and Willet to my chamber, and there did, with tears in my eyes, which I could not help, discharge her and advise her to be gone as soon as she could, and never to see me, or let me see her more while she was in the house.

1668-11-12 12:34   To dinner, and Mr. Wayth, who, being at my office about business, I took him with me to talk and understand his matters, who is in mighty trouble from the Committee of Accounts about his contracting with this Office for sail-cloth, but no hurt can be laid at his door in it.

1668-11-12 02:55 r And so continued almost half the night, the moon shining so that it was light, and after much sorrow and reproaches and little ravings (though I am apt to think they were counterfeit from her), and my promise to discharge the girl myself, all was quiet again, and so to sleep.

1668-11-11 23:03   To supper and to bed, where, after lying a little while, my wife starts up, and with expressions of affright and madness, as one frantic, would rise, and I would not let her, but burst out in tears myself.

1668-11-11 12:58   I home to dinner, and there with my people dined, and so to my wife, who would not dine with me that she might not have the girl come in sight, and there sat and talked a while with her and pretty quiet.

1668-11-11 09:32 r They brought Mr. Hutchinson with them, who, I hear, is to be their Paymaster, in the room of Mr. Waith. For it seems they do turn out every servant that belongs to the present Treasurer: and so for Fenn, do bring in Mr. Littleton, Sir Thomas’s brother, and oust all the rest.

1668-11-11 09:03   To the Office, where, by a special desire, the new Treasurers come, and there did show their Patent, and the Great Seal for the suspension of my Lord Anglesey: and here did sit and discourse of the business of the Office.

1668-11-11 00:51 r And at last with new vows, and particularly that I would myself bid the girl be gone, and show my dislike to her, which I will endeavour to perform, but with much trouble.

1668-11-11 00:13 r And she kept raving till past midnight, that made me cry and weep heartily all the while for her, and troubled for what she reproached me with as before.

1668-11-10 22:44 r I to my office, and there late, and so home to supper with my wife, and so to bed, where after half-an-hour’s slumber she wakes me and cries out that she should never sleep more.

1668-11-10 14:40 r All which I did acknowledge and was troubled for, and wept, and at last pretty good friends again.

1668-11-10 14:24 r As also with the many temptations she hath refused out of faithfulness to me, whereof several she was particular in, and especially from my Lord Sandwich, by the sollicitation of Captain Ferrers, and then the courtship of my Lord Hinchingbrooke, even to the trouble of his lady.

1668-11-10 14:10 r We to talk again, and my wife to be troubled, reproaching me with my unkindness and perjury, I having denied my ever kissing the girl.

1668-11-10 13:20 r So my wife would not go down to dinner, but I would dine in her chamber with her, and there after mollifying her as much as I could we were pretty quiet and eat.

1668-11-10 12:32 r Home, where I found my wife troubled. She tells me that it is from her examining the girl and getting a confession from her, even to the very tocando su thing with my hand, which do trouble me, as not being able to foresee the consequences of it, as to our future peace together.

1668-11-10 07:32   Up, and my wife still every day as ill as she is all night, will rise to see me out doors, telling me plainly that she dares not let me see the girl.

1668-11-09 17:13   To the Excise Office, thinking to meet Sir Stephen Fox and the Cofferer, but the former was gone, and the latter I met going out, but nothing done, and so I to my bookseller’s, and also to Crow’s, and there saw a piece of my bed, and I find it will please us mightily.

1668-11-09 12:48 r Creed and I walked together, and did talk a of the weak report my Lord made, and were troubled for it; I fearing that either his mind and judgment are depressed, or that he do it out of his great neglect, and so my fear that he do all the rest of his affairs accordingly.

1668-11-09 12:12 r Whereas, he might have shown himself to have merited extraordinary thanks, and been held to have done a very great service: whereas now, all that cost the King hath been at for his journey through Spain thither, seems to be almost lost.

1668-11-09 12:09 r Though my Lord had admirable matter for it, and his doings there were good, and would have afforded a noble account, yet he did it with a mind so low and mean, and delivered in so poor a manner, that it appeared nothing at all, nor any body seemed to value it.

1668-11-09 11:32 r Thence to White Hall with my Lord, to the Committee of Tangier; a day appointed for him to give an account of Tangier, and what he did, and found there.

1668-11-09 10:43   I to Lord Sandwich’s, and there to see him; but was made to stay so long, as his best friends are, and when I come to him so little pleasure, his head being full of his own business, I think, that I have no pleasure to go to him.

1668-11-09 06:45 r The truth is I did adventure upon God’s pardoning me this lie, knowing how heavy a thing it would be for me to the ruin of the poor girl, knowing that if my wife should know all it were impossible ever for her to be at peace with me and so our whole lives would be uncomfortable.

1668-11-09 06:40   Up, and I did by a little note which I flung to Deb. advise her that I did continue to deny that ever I kissed her, and so she might govern herself. The girl read, and as I bid her returned me the note, flinging it to me in passing by.

1668-11-08 22:20 r I could wish in that respect that the girl was out of the house, for our peace is broke to all of us while she is here, and so to bed, where my wife mighty unquiet, so as my bed is become burdensome to me.

1668-11-08 21:10 r As pleasant as we can we supped together, and so made the boy read to me, the poor girl not appearing at supper, but hid herself in her chamber.

1668-11-08 20:31 r At my chamber again to work all the afternoon till night, when Pelling comes, who wonders to find my wife so dull and melancholy, but God knows she hath too much cause.

1668-11-08 12:05   To dinner, the girl with us, but my wife troubled thereat to see her, and do tell me so, which troubles me, for I love the girl.

1668-11-07 19:28   I did go out towards Sir D. Gawden’s, thinking to have bespoke a place for my coach and horses at the Victualling Office; but find the way so bad and long that I returned, and looked for places elsewhere, in an inne, which I hope to get with more convenience than there.

1668-11-07 18:40   At the office all the morning, and so to it again after dinner, and there busy late, choosing to employ myself rather than go home to trouble with my wife, whom, however, I am forced to comply with, and indeed I do pity her as having cause enough for her grief.

1668-11-06 17:13 r At last did pitch upon a little chariott, whose body was framed, but not covered, at the widow’s, that made Mr. Lowther’s fine coach; and we are mightily pleased with it, it being light, and will be very genteel and sober: to be covered with leather, and yet will hold four.

1668-11-06 17:02 r Thence with Mr. Povy spent all the afternoon going up and down among the coachmakers in Cow Lane, and did see several.

1668-11-06 14:10 r I was mightily pleased with this company and their discourse, so as to have been seldom so much in all my life, and so after dinner up into his upper room, and there did see a piece of perspective, but much inferior to Mr. Povy’s.

1668-11-06 13:40 r Here much extraordinary noble discourse of foreign princes, and particularly the greatness of the King of France, and of his being fallen into the right way of making the kingdom great, which [none] of his ancestors ever did before.

1668-11-06 13:25 r And so away, and to the Swedes Agent’s, and there met Mr. Povy; where the Agent would have me stay and dine, there being only them, and Joseph Williamson, and Sir Thomas Clayton; but what he is I know not.

1668-11-06 12:35 r There I met with Sir Robert Holmes, and he invited me and would have me go to dine with him at the Treasurer’s, Sir Thomas Clifford, where I did go and eat some oysters; which while we were at, in comes my Lord Keeper and much company; and so I thought it best to withdraw.

1668-11-06 11:45   I took coach and to Mr. Povy’s, where I hear he is gone to the Swede’s Resident in Covent Garden, where he is to dine. I went thither, but he is not come yet, so I to White Hall to look for him.

1668-11-06 10:50 r I up and down the house to hear news: and there every body’s mouth full of changes; and, among others, the Duke of York’s regiment of Guards, that was raised during the late war at sea, is to be disbanded.

1668-11-06 10:04 r We did conclude upon answers to my mind for the Board, and that that, if put in execution, will do the King’s business. But I do now perceive the Duke of York’s trouble, and that he do lie under great weight of mind from the Duke of Buckingham’s carrying things against him.

1668-11-06 09:40   I to White Hall, and there all of us to wait on the Duke of York, which we did, having little to do. By and by the Duke of York did come to his closet; and there my paper, that I have lately taken pains to draw up, was read, and the Duke of York pleased therewith.

1668-11-05 16:55 r Home by coach, with my mind troubled and finding no content, my wife being still troubled, nor can be at peace while the girl is there, which I am troubled at on the other side.

1668-11-05 15:33 r With him to see my cozen Turner and The., and there sat and talked, they being newly come out of the country; and here pretty merry, and with The. to shew her a coach at Mr. Povy’s man’s, she being in want of one.

1668-11-05 14:15   By coach to see Roger Pepys at his lodgings; and there I did see a book, which my Lord Sandwich hath promised one to me of, “A Description of the Escuriall in Spain;” which I have a great desire to have, though I took it for a finer book when he promised it me.

1668-11-05 12:33   At the office all the morning, and so to dinner, my wife with me, but so as I durst not look upon the girl, though, God knows, notwithstanding all my protestations I could not keep my mind from desiring it.

1668-11-05 07:45   Up, and presently my wife up with me, which she professedly now do every day to dress me, that I may not see Willet, and do eye me, whether I cast my eye upon her, or no; and do keep me from going into the room where she is among the upholsters at work in our blue chamber.

1668-11-04 21:42   My wife and I spent much time talking of our being put out of the Office, and my going to live at Deptford at her brother’s, till I can clear my accounts, and rid my hands of the town, which will take me a year or more, and I do think it will be best for me to do so.

1668-11-04 21:00   A boy is sent me out of the country from Impington by my cozen Roger Pepys’ getting, whom I visited this morning at his chamber in the Strand and carried him to Westminster Hall, where I took a turn or two with him and Sir John Talbot, who talks mighty high for my Lord of Ormond.

1668-11-04 20:30   When I come home I find Deb. not come home, and do doubt whether she be not quite gone or no, but my wife is silent to me in it, and I to her, and am well satisfied that my house will never be at peace between my wife and I unless I let her go, though it grieves me to the heart.

1668-11-04 10:12 r That, that pleases me most is, that Pen is to be removed; and that he hath resigned his place; and particularly Spragg tells me for certain that he hath resigned it, and is become a partner with Gawden in the Victualling: in which I think he hath done a very cunning thing.

1668-11-04 10:10 r That, that troubles me most is, that they begin to talk that the Duke of York’s regiment is ordered to be disbanded; and that undoubtedly his Admiralty will follow: which do shake me mightily, and I fear will have ill consequences in the nation, for these counsels are very mad.

1668-11-04 09:55 r The two new Treasurers did kiss the King’s hand this morning, brought in by my Lord Arlington. They walked up and down together the Court this day, and several people joyed them; but I avoided it, that I might not be seen to look either way.

1668-11-04 09:15   To White Hall; and there I find the King and Duke of York come the last night, and every body’s mouth full of my Lord Anglesey’s suspension being sealed; which it was, it seems, yesterday; so that he is prevented in his remedy at the Council.

1668-11-04 00:45 r My wife did tell me that the only way is to put things out of sight, and this I know she means by Deb, for she tells me that her Aunt was here, and she did tell her of her desire of parting with Deb, but in such kind terms on both sides that my wife is mightily taken with her.

1668-11-04 00:17 r To my grief I did see the poor wretch look on me and see me look on her, and then let drop a tear or two, which do make my heart relent at this minute that I am writing this with great trouble of mind, for she is indeed my sacrifice, poor girl.

1668-11-04 00:15   So home, and there to supper, and I observed my wife to eye my eyes whether I did ever look upon Deb., which I could not but do now and then.

1668-11-03 23:57   To the Office, and there busy till 12 at night, without much pain to my eyes, but I did not use them to read or write, and so did hold out very well.

1668-11-03 11:11   We had a great deal of do at the Office about Clutterbucke, I declaring my dissent against the whole Board’s proceedings, and I believe I shall go near to shew W. Pen a very knave in it, whatever I find my Lord Brouncker.

1668-11-02 21:25   This day I went, by Mr. Povy’s direction, to a coachmaker near him, for a coach just like his, but it was sold this very morning.

1668-11-02 15:10   After dinner up, and looked up and down the house, and so to the cellar; and thence I slipt away, without taking leave, and so to a few places about business, and so home, where the house still full of dirt by painters and others, and will not be clean a good while.

1668-11-02 13:40 r I was glad to see it: but sorry, methought, to see my Lord have so little reason to be merry, and yet glad, for his sake, to have him cheerful.

1668-11-02 13:20   So to Mr. Povy’s to talk about a coach, but there I find my Lord Sandwich, and Peterborough, and Hinchingbroke, Charles Harbord, and Sidney Montagu; and there I was stopped, and dined mighty nobly at a good table, with one little dish at a time upon it, but mighty merry.

1668-11-02 09:10   Up, and a cold morning, by water through bridge without a cloak, and there to Mr. Wren at his chamber at White Hall, and he and I did read over my paper that I have with so much labour drawn up about the answers of the officers of this Office to the Duke of York’s reflections.

1668-11-01 22:20 r I think that it will be fit that she should be gone, for my wife’s peace and mine, for she cannot but be offended at the sight of her, my wife having conceived this jealousy of me with reason, and therefore it will be best to let her go, but I shall love and pity her.

1668-11-01 22:18   And so to supper and to bed, my mind yet at disquiet that I cannot be informed how poor Deb. stands with her mistress, but I fear she will put her away.

1668-11-01 17:00   Mr. Povy sent his coach for my wife and I to see, which we like mightily, and will endeavour to have him get us just such another.

1668-11-01 15:15   With W. Hewer at my chamber all this morning, going further in my great business for the Duke of York, and so at noon to dinner, and then W. Hewer to write fair what he had writ, till anon Mr. Gibson come, and he and I to perfect it to my full mind.
