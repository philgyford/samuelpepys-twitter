1668-05-16 22:32   Home to supper, and to bed, after Nell’s cutting of my hair close, the weather being very hot.

1668-05-16 21:15   I to my tailor’s, and to buy me a belt for my new suit against tomorrow; and so home, and there to my Office, and afterwards late walking in the garden.

1668-05-16 17:27   I to the King’s playhouse, and there saw the best part of “The Sea Voyage,” where Knepp I see do her part of sorrow very well. I afterwards to her house; but she did not come presently home; and there yo did besar her ancilla, which is so mighty belle.

1668-05-15 18:15   I to the King’s house, and there saw the last act of “The Committee,” thinking to have seen Knepp there, but she did not act. And so to my bookseller’s, and there carried home some books-among others, “Dr. Wilkins’s Reall Character.”

1668-05-15 15:55 r But, Lord! to see among the young commanders, and Thomas Killigrew and others that come, how unlike a burial this was, O’Brian taking out some ballads out of his pocket, which I read, and the rest come about me to hear! and there very merry we were all, they being new ballets.

1668-05-15 15:45 r And here we had rings: and here I do hear that some of the last words that he said were that he had a very good King, God bless him! but that the Parliament had very ill rewarded him for all the service he had endeavoured to do them and his country.

1668-05-15 15:30   With Lord Brouncker to Loriners’-hall, by Mooregate, a hall I never heard of before, to Sir Thomas Teddiman’s burial, where most people belonging to the sea were.

1668-05-15 14:03   I to my Lord Brouncker’s, at Mrs Williams’s, and she did show me her closet which I was sorry to see for fear of her expecting something from me; and here she took notice of my wife’s not once coming to see her which I am glad of; for she shall not — a prating, vain, idle woman.

1668-05-15 10:20   To a Committee for Tangier, where God knows how my Lord Bellasses’s accounts passed; understood by nobody but my Lord Ashly, who, I believe, was mad to let them go as he pleased.

1668-05-15 08:15   Betimes to White Hall, and met with Sir H. Cholmly at Sir Stephen Fox’s, and there was also the Cofferer, and we did there consider about our money and the condition of the Excise and after much dispute agreed upon a state thereof and the manner of our future course of payments.

1668-05-14 22:10 r And then out again and walked, and it beginning to be dark, we to a corner and sang, that everybody got about us to hear us; and so home, where I saw them both at their doors, and, full of the content of this afternoon’s pleasure, I home.

1668-05-14 19:55 r And so up by water and to Fox-hall, where we walked a great while, and pleased mightily with the pleasure thereof, and the company there, and then in, and eat and drank.

1668-05-14 17:30 r Into the playhouse again, and there saw “The Country Captain,” a very dull play, that did give us no content, and besides, little company there, which made it very unpleasing.

1668-05-14 13:50   To Penny’s, my tailor’s, where by agreement Mercer, and she, to my great content, brings Mrs. Gayet, and I carried them to the King’s house; but, coming too soon, we out again to the Rose tavern, and there I did give them a tankard of cool drink, the weather being very hot.

1668-05-13 22:30   To Michell’s, and did see her and drink there, but he being there yo no puede besar la; and so back again by water to Spring Garden all alone, and walked a little, and so back again home, and there a little to my viall, and so to bed, Mrs. Turner having sat and supped with me.

1668-05-13 15:32 r Which, for my part, I think a piece of folly for them to meddle with, because the secret cannot be long kept.

1668-05-13 15:30   And so to attend the Council about the business of Hemskirke’s project of building a ship that sails two feet for one of any other ship, which the Council did agree to be put in practice, the King to give him, if it proves good, 5000l. in hand, and 15,000l. more in seven years.

1668-05-13 10:48   Into the Park, and there met Sir H. Cholmly, and he and I to Sir Stephen Fox’s, where we met and considered the business of the Excise, how far it is charged in reference to the payment of the Guards and Tangier.

1668-05-13 09:20   I hear that last night Sir Thomas Teddiman, poor man! did die by a thrush in his mouth: a good man, and stout and able, and much lamented; though people do make a little mirth, and say, as I believe it did in good part, that the business of the Parliament did break his heart.

1668-05-12 21:30 r And so parted, I having there seen a mummy in a merchant’s warehouse, all the middle of the man or woman’s body, black and hard. I never saw any before, and, therefore, it pleased me much, though an ill sight; and he did give me a little bit, and a bone of an arme, I suppose.

1668-05-12 21:10 r By moonshine with infinite pleasure home, and there sang again in Mercer’s garden.

1668-05-12 19:10 r After sitting and talking a little, I took them out, and carried them through Hackney to Kingsland, and there walked to Sir G. Whitmore’s house, where I have not been many a day; and so to the old house at Islington, and eat, and drank, and sang, and mighty merry.

1668-05-12 16:50 r And then to Mrs. Mercer’s, where I met with her two daughters, and a pretty lady I never knew yet, one Mrs. Susan Gayet, a very pretty lady, that speaks French well, and is a Catholic, and merchant’s daughter, by us, and here was also Mrs. Anne Jones.

1668-05-12 15:10   Creed and I, by water to the Temple, where we parted, and I both to the King’s and Duke of York’s playhouses, and there went through the houses to see what faces I could spy that I knew, and meeting none, I away by coach to my house.

1668-05-11 22:16 r So by water, with great pleasure, down to the Bridge, and there landed, and took water again on the other side; and so to the Tower, and I saw her home, I myself home to my chamber, and by and by to bed.

1668-05-11 20:02 r I took Mercer by water to Spring Garden; and there with pleasure walked, and eat, and drank, and sang, making people come about us, to hear us, and two little children of one of our neighbours that happened to be there, did come into our arbour, and we made them dance prettily.

1668-05-11 16:23 r But, however, I did deny it, and did not pay her; but, for quiet, did buy 4s. worth of oranges of her, at 6d. a-piece.

1668-05-11 16:20 r But there happened one thing which vexed me which is that the orange-woman did come in the pit, and challenge me for twelve oranges which she delivered by my order at a late play, at night, to give to some ladies in a box, which was wholly untrue but yet she swore it to be true.

1668-05-11 16:03 r But now I have got the words clear, and, in going in thither, had the pleasure to see the actors in their several dresses, especially the seamen and monster, which were very droll: so into the play again.

1668-05-11 16:00 r Between two acts, I went out to Mr. Harris, and got him to repeat to me the words of the Echo, while I writ them down, having tried in the play to have wrote them; but, when I had done it, having done it without looking upon my paper, I find I could not read the blacklead.

1668-05-11 14:40   I to dinner with Balty and his wife, who is come to town to-day from Deptford to see us, and after dinner I out and took a coach, and called Mercer, and she and I to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there saw “The Tempest,”

1668-05-11 12:10   This day Kate Joyce was to be married to a man called Hollingshed, whom she indeed did once tell me of, and desired me to enquire after him. But, whatever she said of his being rich, I do fear it is not as it ought to be; but, as she brews, let her bake.

1668-05-10 20:26 r But yo did besar la and tocar sus mamelles, ella being poco shy but doth speak con mighty kindness to me that she would desire me por su marido if it were to be done.

1668-05-10 20:24 r At the Tower wharf there we did send for a pair of old shoes for Mrs. Lowther, and there I did pull the others off and put them on, and did endeavour para tocar su thigh but ella had drawers on.

1668-05-10 19:40 r And so to water again, and set down the old woman at home at Durham Yard: and it raining all the way, it troubled us; but, however, my cloak kept us all dry, and so home.

1668-05-10 18:20   I took my Lady Pen, and Mrs. Lowther, and old Mrs. Whistler, her mother-in-law, by water with great pleasure as far as Chelsy, and so back to Spring Garden, at Fox-hall, and there walked, and eat, and drank.

1668-05-10 14:30   I to church, and so home, and there comes W. Hewer and Balty, and by and by I sent for Mercer to come and dine with me, and pretty merry, and after dinner I fell to teach her “Canite Jehovae,” which she did a great part presently.

1668-05-10 11:00   Mr. Shepley, newly come to town, come to see me, and did by the by as he would seem tell me that my Lady Sandwich had it in her thoughts, if she had occasion, to, borrow 100l. of me, which I did not declare any opposition to, though I doubt it will be so much lost.

1668-05-09 19:40   I did talk with Mrs. Lowther, who is very kind to me, more than usual, and I will make use of it. She begins to draw very well, and I think do as well, if not better, than my wife, if it be true that she do it herself, what she shews me.

1668-05-09 18:10   I towards the New Exchange and there bought a pair of black silk stockings at the hosier’s that hath the very pretty woman to his wife, about ten doors on this side of the ’Change, and she is indeed very pretty but I think a notable talking woman by what I heard to others there.

1668-05-09 17:20   Sir W. Pen and I into the King’s house, and there “The Mayd’s Tragedy,” a good play, but Knepp not there; and my head and eyes out of order, the first from my drinking wine at dinner, and the other from my much work in the morning.

1668-05-09 12:05 r Here we are told also that last night the Duchesse of Monmouth, dancing at her lodgings, hath sprained her thigh.

1668-05-09 11:58   Up, and to the office, where all the morning we sat. Here I first hear that the Queene hath miscarryed of a perfect child, being gone about ten weeks, which do shew that she can conceive, though it be unfortunate that she cannot bring forth.

1668-05-08 21:10   Brouncker, Pen, and I to Brouncker’s house, and there sat and talked, I asking many questions in mathematics to my Lord, which he do me the pleasure to satisfy me in, and here we drank and so spent an hour, and so W. Pen and I home.

1668-05-08 13:33   My Lord Crew tells me that there are great disputes like to be at Court, between the factions of the two women, my Lady Castlemayne and Mrs. Stewart, and the King hath made several public visits to her, and like to come to Court: the other is to go to Barkeshire-house.

1668-05-07 22:34 r And so set Mrs. Knepp at her lodging, and so the rest, and I home talking with a great deal of pleasure, and so home to bed.

1668-05-07 21:45 r But endeavouring afterward to tocar her con mi cosa, ella did strive against that, but yet I do not think that she did find much fault with it, but I was a little moved at my offering it and not having it.

1668-05-07 21:40 r And so home by moonshine, I all the way having mi mano abaxo la jupe de Knepp con much placer and freedom.

1668-05-07 20:45 r Here was also Haynes, the incomparable dancer of the King’s house, and a seeming civil man, and sings pretty well, and they gone, we abroad to Marrowbone, and there walked in the garden, the first time I ever was there; and a pretty place it is, and here we eat and drank.

1668-05-07 19:20 r Here took up Knepp into our coach, and all of us with her to her lodgings, and thither comes Bannister with a song of hers, that he hath set in Sir Charles Sidly’s play for her; this he did teach her, and it being but a slight, silly, short ayre, she learnt it presently.

1668-05-07 17:58 r Lord! their confidence! and how many men do hover about them as soon as they come off the stage, and how confident they are in their talk! I did kiss the pretty woman newly come, called Pegg, that was Sir Charles Sidly’s mistress, a pretty woman, and seems, but is not, modest.

1668-05-07 17:47 r Thence called Knepp from the King’s house, where going in for her, the play being done, I did see Beck Marshall come dressed, off of the stage, and looks mighty fine, and pretty, and noble: and also Nell, in her boy’s clothes, mighty pretty.

1668-05-07 17:20   I sent for Mercer to dine with me, and after dinner she and I called Mrs. Turner, and I carried them to the Duke of York’s house, and there saw “The Man’s the Master,” which proves, upon my seeing it again, a very good play.

1668-05-06 21:10 r And there, ponendo the key in the door, yo tocar sus mamelles con mi mano and su cosa with me cosa et yo did dar-la a shilling, and so parted, and yo home to put up things against tomorrow’s carrier for my wife.

1668-05-06 20:48 r I did see our Nell, Payne’s daughter, and her yo did desear venga after migo, and so ella did seque me to Tower Hill to our back entry there that comes upon the degres entrant into nostra garden.

1668-05-06 20:20 r I did walk in the dusk up and down, round through our garden, over Tower Hill, and through Crutched Friars, three or four times, and did meet Mercer and another pretty lady, but being surprized I could say little, although I had an opportunity of pleasing myself, but left them.

1668-05-06 19:22 r And there I found her on a pallet in the dark, where yo did poner mi manos under her jupe and tocar su cosa and waked her; that is Knepp. And so to talk; and by and by did eat some curds and cream, and thence away home.

1668-05-06 18:10   I back to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Virgin Martyr,” and heard the music that I like so well, and intended to have seen Knepp, but I let her alone; and having there done, went to Mrs. Pierces back again, where she was.

1668-05-06 13:50   By water to the New Exchange, where bought a pair of shoe-strings, and so to Mr. Pierces, where invited, and there was Knepp and Mrs. Foster and here dined, but a poor, sluttish dinner, as usual, and so I could not be heartily merry at it.

1668-05-06 11:04   This morning the House is upon the City Bill, and they say hath passed it, though I am sorry that I did not think to put somebody in mind of moving for the churches to be allotted according to the convenience of the people, and not to gratify this Bishop, or that College.

1668-05-06 10:10   I met Mrs. Washington, my old acquaintance of the Hall, whose husband has a place in the Excise at Windsor, and it seems lives well. I have not seen her these 8 or 9 years, and she begins to grow old, I perceive, visibly. So time do alter, and do doubtless the like in myself.

1668-05-05 17:35 r One thing of familiarity I observed in my Lady Castlemayne: she called to one of her women, for a little patch off her face, and put it into her mouth and wetted it, and so clapped it upon her own by the side of her mouth, I suppose she feeling a pimple rising there.

1668-05-05 17:28 r My Lady pretty well pleased with it; but here I sat close to her fine woman, Willson, who indeed is very handsome, but, they say, with child by the King.

1668-05-05 17:20 r There we sat with them, and I saw “The Impertinents” once more, now three times, and the three only days it hath been acted. And to see the folly how the house do this day cry up the play more than yesterday! and I for that reason like it, I find, the better, too.

1668-05-05 14:15   Creed and I to the Duke of York’s playhouse; and there coming late, he and I up to the balcony-box, where we find my Lady Castlemayne and several great ladies.

1668-05-04 20:58 r Mrs. Pierce called me from the gallery, and I took her and Mrs. Corbet by coach up and down, and took up Captain Rolt; and at last I carried them to the Beare in Drury Lane, and there did treat them with a dish of mackrell, the first I have seen this year, and mighty merry.

1668-05-04 17:13   To the Duke of York’s house, and there saw “The Impertinents” again, and with less pleasure than before, it being but a very contemptible play, though there are many little witty expressions in it; and the pit did generally say that of it.

1668-05-04 09:20   To the Duke, and there present Balty to the Duke of York and a letter from the Board to him about him, and the Duke of York is mightily pleased with him, and I doubt not his continuance in employment, which I am glad of.

1668-05-03 19:10 r Thence Pen and I to Islington, and there, at the old house, eat, and drank, and merry, and there by chance giving two pretty fat boys each of them a cake, they proved to be Captain Holland’s children, whom therefore I pity.

1668-05-03 17:40   With Sir W. Pen took a hackney, and he and I to Old Street, to a brew-house there, to see Sir Thomas Teddiman, who is very ill in bed of a fever, got, I believe, by the fright the Parliament have put him into, of late. But he is a good man, a good seaman, and stout.

1668-05-03 15:27   To church again where I did please myself con mes ojos shut in futar in conceit the hook-nosed young lady, a merchant’s daughter, in the upper pew in the church under the pulpit.

1668-05-03 13:32   At noon comes Mr. Mills and his wife, and Mr. Turner and his wife, by invitation to dinner, and we were mighty merry, and a very pretty dinner, of my Bridget and Nell’s dressing, very handsome.

1668-05-03 09:03   To church, where I saw Sir A. Rickard, though he be under the Black Rod, by order of the Lords’ House, upon the quarrel between the East India Company and Skinner, which is like to come to a very great heat between the two Houses.

1668-05-02 22:10 r And so home to the Office, ended my letters, and, to spare my eyes, home, and played on my pipes, and so to bed.

1668-05-02 21:03 r Thence to the King’s house to see Knepp, but the play done; and so I took a hackney alone, and to the park, and there spent the evening, and to the lodge, and drank new milk.

1668-05-02 17:25 r But a little boy, for a farce, do dance Polichinelli, the best that ever anything was done in the world, by all men’s report: most pleased with that, beyond anything in the world, and much beyond all the play.

1668-05-02 17:21 r But I had my place, and by and by the King comes and the Duke of York; and then the play begins, called “The Sullen Lovers; or, The Impertinents,” having many good humours in it, but the play tedious, and no design at all in it.

1668-05-02 13:15   To the Duke of York’s playhouse, at a little past twelve, to get a good place in the pit, against the new play, and there setting a poor man to keep my place, I out, and spent an hour at Martin’s, my bookseller’s, and so back again, where I find the house quite full.

1668-05-01 22:10   By water, not being able to get a coach, nor boat but a sculler, and that with company, is being so foul a day, to the Old Swan, and so home, and there spent the evening, making Balty read to me, and so to supper and to bed.

1668-05-01 17:02   To Hercules Pillars, and there dined all alone, and then to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Surprizall;” and a disorder in the pit by its raining in, from the cupola at top, it being a very foul day, and cold, so as there are few I believe go to the Park today, if any.

1668-05-01 12:22   I met my cozen Thomas Pepys of Deptford, and took some turns with him; who is mightily troubled for this Act now passed against Conventicles, and in few words, and sober, do lament the condition we are in, by a negligent Prince and a mad Parliament.

1668-05-01 11:50   I met Sir W. Pen, who labours to have his answer to his impeachment, and sent down from the Lords’ House, read by the House of Commons; but they are so busy on other matters, that he cannot, and thereby will, as he believes, by design, be prevented from going to sea this year.
