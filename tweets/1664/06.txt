1664-06-30 21:32   Great doubts yet whether the Dutch war go on or no. The Fleet ready in the Hope, of twelve sayle.

1664-06-30 21:04   I end the month with my mind full of business and some sorrow that I have not performed all my vowes, though my not doing is not my fault.

1664-06-30 20:27   To the making up my month’s accounts, and find myself still a gainer and rose to 951l, for which God be blessed.

1664-06-30 18:15   Though the man told me he laboured in the King’s yarde, yet, God forgive me! I did doubt he might knock me on the head.

1664-06-30 18:14   Walked back from Woolwich to Greenwich all alone, save a man that had a cudgell in his hand.

1664-06-29 16:04   My Lady and I sat two hours alone, talking of the condition of her family’s being in debt, and many children now coming up to provide for.

1664-06-29 13:37   My Lord Sandwich was pleasant enough at table with me, but yet without any discourse of business, or any regard to me when dinner was over.

1664-06-29 10:59   Dean Honiwood is a good-natured, but a very weak man, yet a Dean, and a man in great esteem.

1664-06-29 07:44   Mr Shepley tells me how my brave dogg I did give him, going out betimes one morning, was set upon by five other doggs and worried to pieces.

1664-06-28 21:15   I began to have Dr. Burnett’s advice about my disease, and then invited him to my house: and I am resolved to put myself into his hands.

1664-06-28 20:41   To the Mitre and there comes Dr. Burnett to us and Mr. Maes, but the meeting was chiefly to bring the Doctor and me together.

1664-06-28 19:22   My uncle Wight do complain of his wife most cruel as the most troublesome woman in the world, and how she will have her will.

1664-06-28 05:40   Put on a half shirt first this summer, it being very hot; and yet so ill-tempered I am grown, that I am afeard I shall catch cold.

1664-06-27 20:55   I by water home, it being night first, and there I find our new mayd Jane come, a cook mayd.

1664-06-27 09:22   Mr. Creed and I walked to Paul’s Church yard, and there saw Sir Harry Spillman’s book, and I bespoke it and others.

1664-06-27 00:10   By and by the evening turned mighty clear and moonshine; we got with great pleasure home.

1664-06-26 22:30   It being rainy, and thundering mightily, and lightning, we returned.

1664-06-26 21:55   We stopped, but went not on shore, only Creed, to get some cherries, and send a letter to the Hope, where the Fleete lies.

1664-06-26 21:20   The tide with us got down, but it was night, and the tide spent by the time we got to Gravesend.

1664-06-26 17:15   With good victuals and drink, we took boat presently.

1664-06-26 16:20   A frolique took us, we would go this afternoon to the Hope.

1664-06-26 11:31   At our owne church looked in, and there heard one preach whom Sir W. Pen desired us yesterday to hear, a very silly fellow.

1664-06-26 09:12   But my Lord will rather have my Lady Katharine’s cheek be as it is, with a scarr in her face, than endanger it being worse by tampering.

1664-06-26 09:10   My Lord’s little daughter is lately come from my father’s at Brampton, to have her cheek looked after, which is and hath long been sore.

1664-06-25 16:42   To my office busy, and by and by home with Mr. Deane to a lesson upon raising a Bend of Timbers.

1664-06-25 05:50   Mr. Creed lay with me all night and rose very merry talking, and excellent company he is, that is the truth of it, and a most cunning man.

1664-06-24 16:06   It is the only time in my life that ever I was so at a loss for pleasure, in the greatest plenty of objects to give it me.

1664-06-24 16:05   To the King’s closett where such variety of pictures, and other things of value, that I was properly confounded and enjoyed no pleasure.

1664-06-24 15:41   We met the Queene, with her Mayds of Honour, all in silver-lace gowns again: which I did not think would have been brought up again.

1664-06-24 15:18   Mr. Pierce showed me the Queen’s clock by her bed-side, wherein a lamp burns that tells her the time of the night at any time.

1664-06-24 15:07   To White Hall; and met with Mr. Pierce. He showed me the Queene’s bed-chamber, and her closett, where she had nothing but pious pictures.

1664-06-24 07:55   To the City granarys, where it seems every company have their granary and obliged to keep such a quantity of corne always there.

1664-06-23 16:03   I pray God gets me well rid of his Lordship as to his debt, and I care not.

1664-06-22 12:51   To the Coffee-house, where great talke of the Dutch preparing of sixty sayle of ships. The plague grows mightily among them.

1664-06-21 16:30   I perceive by Mr. Moore my Lord’s business of his family and estate goes very ill, and runs in debt mightily.

1664-06-21 11:54   Being weary yesterday with walking I sleep long, and at last up and to the office, where all the morning.

1664-06-20 21:33   My wife finding fault with Besse for her calling upon Jane, and there heard Mrs. Harper and her talk ill of us and not told us of it.

1664-06-20 19:41   My Lord received me with as little concernment as in the middle of his discontent, and a fool I am to be of so servile a humour.

1664-06-20 11:08   The young ladies make a great story of their appearing before their mother the morning after we carried them, the last week, home so late.

1664-06-20 08:52   The Dutch have wrote to the King, to assure him that their ships were only to defend their fishing-trade, not to annoy the King’s subjects.

1664-06-20 06:03   It having been a cold night last night I had got some cold and so in pain by wind, and a sure precursor of pain is sudden letting off farts.

1664-06-19 19:41   Home to my wife, and talked seriously of bringing Pall out of the country to us here to try to put her off, which I am very desirous.

1664-06-19 16:17   The greatest shower of rain of a sudden and the greatest and most continued thunder that ever I heard I think in my life.

1664-06-18 14:10   Strange to see how pert Sir W. Pen is come from Portsmouth with his head full of great reports of his service and the state of the ships.

1664-06-17 21:48   Mightily troubled in my mind to hear how Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes do labour all they can to abuse or enable others to abuse the King.

1664-06-17 17:50   The corruptions of the Navy are of so many kinds that it is endless to look after them.

1664-06-17 15:22   To Deptford by water, and there very long informing myself in the business of flags and bewpers and other things.

1664-06-17 10:40   To Woolwich to make a discovery of a cheat in the working of some of our own ground Tows into new cordage to be sold to us for Riga cordage.

1664-06-16 20:15   I spoke with my cozen Richard Pepys upon the ’Change, about supplying us with bewpers from Norwich, which I should be glad of, if cheap.

1664-06-16 19:20   The talk upon the ’Change is that De Ruyter is dead, with fifty men of his own ship, of the plague, at Cales.

1664-06-16 17:33   By water to see a vessell we have hired to carry more soldiers to Tangier, and also visited a rope ground, wherein I learnt useful things.

1664-06-16 14:44   Mr. Ackworth (though he knows himself and I know him to be a very knave), yet he came to me to discover the knavery of other people.

1664-06-16 06:32   Being well pleased with our frolique, walked to Knightsbridge, and there eat a messe of creame.

1664-06-16 00:38   At the last house, at last, we found some people drinking and roaring; and there got in, and after drinking, got an ill bed.

1664-06-16 00:07   Into the towne, Creed and I; and to several houses, inns, but could get no lodging, all being in bed.

1664-06-15 23:37   We came safe, however, to their house, where all were abed. So put them into doors; and leaving them with the mayds, bade them good night.

1664-06-15 22:48   Lord! the fear that my Lady Paulina was in every step of the way; and indeed at this time of the night it was no safe thing to go that road.

1664-06-15 22:35   I sent my wife home by coach with Mr. Creed’s boy; and myself and Creed in the coach home with the ladies.

1664-06-15 21:55   We waited for the young ladies, their coach; but it being so late, I doubted what to do how to get them home.

1664-06-15 20:32   To the Cherry Garden, and then by water singing finely to the Bridge, and there landed; and so took boat again, and to Somersett House.

1664-06-15 18:23   By water down to Greenwich; and up to the top of the hill, and there played upon the ground at cards.

1664-06-15 14:04   Comes Mr Creed, and the three young ladies: and merry we were with our pasty; and a dish of roasted chickens; pease, lobsters, strawberries.

1664-06-14 17:28   Into Sir H Finche’s garden, and a mighty fine cool place it is, with a great laver of water in the middle and the bravest place for musique.

1664-06-14 16:03   She is a woman of such an ayre, as I wonder the less at my Lord’s favour to her, and I warrant him she hath brains enough to entangle him.

1664-06-14 15:58   She hath not one good feature in her face, and yet is a fine lady, of a fine taille, and very well carriaged, and mighty discreet.

1664-06-14 15:55   Much company came hither, my Lady Carteret, &c, Sir William Wheeler and his lady, and, Mr. Becke and wife and daughter, my Lord’s mistress.

1664-06-14 14:30   By coach to Kensington, to my Lady Sandwich, who hath lain this fortnight here at Deane Hodges’s.

1664-06-14 11:52   To the office, and had great conflict about the flags again, but however I stop the King’s being abused by the flag makers for the present.

1664-06-13 19:28   Having a gally down to Greenwich, and there saw the King’s works a-doing there, and so to the Cherry Garden, and carried some cherries home.

1664-06-13 14:49   Mr. Coventry proposed to me the writing of the History of the late Dutch warr, which, if well done, may recommend me much.

1664-06-13 05:55   I rated at Captain Taylor, whom I found a lying and a very stupid blundering fellow, good for nothing and of no judgment or dispatch at all.

1664-06-12 21:48   My wife made great means to be friends, coming to my bedside and doing all things to please me and I could not hold out, but seemed pleased.

1664-06-12 16:52   Without any the least cause my wife had the cunning to cry a great while, and talk and blubber, which made me mighty angry in mind.

1664-06-12 16:49   We to the Half-way house, and there eat and drank, and upon a very small occasion had a difference again broke out.

1664-06-12 15:22   Then the question was whether my wife should go, and she having dressed herself, was angry and began to talk of my keeping her within doors.

1664-06-12 15:10   My wife and I began our great dispute about going to Griffin’s child’s christening, where I was to have been godfather.

1664-06-11 19:33   To my office vexed with Captain Taylor about the delay of carrying down the ship hired by me for Tangier.

1664-06-11 17:15   At Hackney ’light, and played at shuffle-board, eat cream and good churies; and so with good refreshment home.

1664-06-11 15:07   By coach with my wife only to take the ayre, it being very warm and pleasant, to Bowe and Old Ford; and thence to Hackney.

1664-06-11 10:52   Some discourse arose from Sir G Carteret and Mr Coventry, which gives me occasion to think that something like a war is expected now indeed.

1664-06-10 09:43   Walked with Capt. Sylas Taylor and Dr Whore, talking of musique, and particularly of Mr Berckenshaw’s way, which Taylor magnifies mightily.

1664-06-09 20:42   I think all the world is grown false.

1664-06-08 22:05   In my study writing of my old broken office notes in shorthand all in one book, till my eyes did ake ready to drop out.

1664-06-08 13:22   My Lord, who sent his daughters thither, will come under pretence to see them, and pack them out of doors, and stay behind with Mrs. Becke.

1664-06-08 13:20   Creed do tell me that my Lord’s daughters do perceive all, and do hate Chelsea, and the young woman there, Mrs. Betty Becke.

1664-06-07 08:10   Up and to the office (having by my going by water without any thing upon my legs yesterday got some pain upon me again).

1664-06-06 22:05   I found my wife a little better. A little to my office, then home to supper and to bed.

1664-06-06 20:26   I find myself every day become more and more known, and shall one day hope to have benefit by it.

1664-06-06 14:15   To Trinity House. A great dinner. Mr. Prin would not drink any health, no, not the King’s, but sat down with his hat on all the while.

1664-06-06 10:04   To Deptford, and found our Trinity Brethren come from their election to church, where Dr. Britton made, methought, an indifferent sermon.

1664-06-06 06:32   Up and found my wife very ill again, which troubles me, but I was forced to go forth.

1664-06-05 19:44   All the afternoon with my wife discoursing and talking, and in the evening to my office doing business.

1664-06-05 01:24   My wife is very ill. From some cold she got to-day, or from something else, she is taken with great gripings, a looseness, and vomiting.

1664-06-04 17:04   So to the Committee for Tangier all afternoon, where still the same confused doings. It grieves me to see how brokenly things are ordered.

1664-06-04 09:42   Giving the Duke an account of the necessity of a power to presse seamen, without which we cannot raise men for this fleete of twelve sayle.

1664-06-03 17:52   Prince Rupert do nothing but swear and laugh a little, with an oathe or two, and that’s all he do.

1664-06-03 17:47   At the Committee for Tangier all the afternoon, where a sad consideration to see things of so great weight managed in so confused a manner.

1664-06-03 12:14   We sat at the office extraordinary upon the business of our stores. Lord! what a pitiful account the Surveyor makes of it grieves my heart.

1664-06-02 22:32   To supper and bed, being now in constant pain in my back, but whether it be only wind or what it is the Lord knows, but I fear the worst.

1664-06-02 14:04   To White Hall to a Committee of Tangier about providing provisions, money, and men for Tangier.

1664-06-01 16:32   Before the play was done, it fell such a storm of hayle that we in the middle of the pit were fain to rise; and all the house in a disorder.

1664-06-01 16:10   To the King’s house, and saw “The Silent Woman;” but methought not so well done or so good a play as I formerly thought it to be.

1664-06-01 09:34   I down by water to Woolwich and Deptford, reading Mr. Spencer’s Book of Prodigys, which is most ingeniously writ, both for matter and style.

1664-06-01 08:25   Mr. Hollyard has brought me something to dissolve the stone, which do make me very much troubled, and pray to God to ease me.

1664-06-01 08:20   Mr. Hollyard came to me, and after his assuring me that I could not have the stone again, he tells me that he do fear that I have it again.
