1664-02-29 22:10 To make up my accounts, and to my great content find myself worth eight hundred and ninety and odd pounds, the greatest sum I ever yet knew.

1664-02-29 12:32 I did look upon a fire in an Inneyard in Lumbard Streete. But, Lord! how the mercers and merchants did carry away their cloths and silks.

1664-02-29 11:25 Sir Phillip Warwick showed me a very excellent argument to prove that our importing lesse than we export do not impoverish the kingdom.

1664-02-29 10:12 Sir Phillip Warwick showed me that the Hollanders have the best manner of tax, which is only upon the expence of provisions, by an excise.

1664-02-29 09:20 To Sir Phillip Warwick to discourse about navy business, which I did, not only about the navy but about the general Revenue of England.

1664-02-28 13:28 I did dine with Sir J. Robinson, his table being good, and his lady a high-carriaged but comely big woman; I was mightily pleased with her.

1664-02-28 11:04 Up and walked to Paul’s. Both before and after sermon I was most impatiently troubled at the Quire, the worst that ever I heard.

1664-02-27 21:52 I had a pleasing and condescending answer from my father in answer to my angry discontentful letter to him, which pleases me mightily.

1664-02-27 13:11 To the African house. Before dinner we had the best oysters I have seen this year, and as good in all respects as ever I eat in my life.

1664-02-27 08:19 I liked Bagwell’s wife very well and stroked her under the chin, but could not find in my heart to offer anything uncivil to her.

1664-02-27 08:06 Before I went to the office there came Bagwell’s wife to me to speak for her husband.

1664-02-26 21:15 My wife to give me good and rational advice how to behave myself to my Lord and his family, by slighting every body but my Lord and Lady.

1664-02-26 20:42 ’Tis an odd thing as my wife tells me my uncle Wight caressing her and coming to give her visits, but I do not trouble myself for him.

1664-02-26 14:22 When we came to my Lord’s house, I went in; and whether it was my Lord’s neglect, I know not, but he made me no kind of compliment there.

1664-02-26 08:10 We set out from an inne, whither Mr. Coventry’s horse was carried, and round about the bush through bad ways to Highgate.

1664-02-25 21:25 God forgive me, disturbed in my mind out of my jealousy of my wife tomorrow when I am out of town, and yet without all reason.

1664-02-24 12:40 To the garden of Somerset House, and up and down the new building, which in every respect will be mighty magnificent and costly.

1664-02-24 11:07 To the Queene’s chappell, where I staid and saw their masse, till a man came and bid me go out or kneel down: so I did go out.

1664-02-23 22:34 I find myself coming to a better esteem in the world than ever I expected. But I pray God give me a heart to prepare for a fall!

1664-02-23 22:32 This day, by the blessing of God, I have lived thirty-one years in the world;

1664-02-23 22:10 To my office, where doing many businesses very late, but to my good content to see how I grow in estimation every day more and more.

1664-02-22 19:59 All the Court are mad for a Dutch war; but both Mr. Alsopp and I did concur, that it was a thing rather to be dreaded than hoped for.

1664-02-22 19:44 There was a French book, translated and presented to the Duke of Monmouth in such a high stile, that the Duke of York was offended at it.

1664-02-22 19:32 The rape upon a woman at Turnstile the other day by two Frenchmen, is hushed up for 300l, being the Queen Mother’s servants.

1664-02-22 19:10 The King loves not the Queen at all, but is rather sullen to her; and she, by all reports, incapable of children.

1664-02-22 12:15 To the ‘Change, my business being to enquire about the manner of other countries keeping of their masts wet or dry, and got good advice.

1664-02-22 10:48 To a picture-sellers and there looked over the maps of several cities and did buy two books of cities stitched together cost me 9s. 6d.

1664-02-22 08:20 I set my wife down by her father’s, being angry with her for the ill-favoured place, among whore houses, that she is forced to come to him.

1664-02-22 04:15 Our little girl Susan is a most admirable slut and pleases us mightily, doing more service than both the others and deserves wages better.

1664-02-21 20:44 But I am apt to think that my uncle Wight do mean us well, and to give us something if he should die without children.

1664-02-21 20:42 My wife told me how my uncle Wight when he had her alone did tell her that he did love her as well as ever he did.

1664-02-21 14:22 I read my brother Tom my letter of discontent to my father, and he is pleased at it, and cries out of my sister’s ill nature and lazy life.

1664-02-21 11:57 I spent all the morning at the office drawing up a letter to Mr. Coventry about preserving of masts, being collections of my own.

1664-02-20 13:10 Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and at noon to the ‘Change with Mr. Coventry and thence home to dinner.

1664-02-19 23:58 Pleased at nothing all the day but Mrs. Jaggard playing on the Vyall, that enough to make me bear with all the rest that did not content me.

1664-02-19 22:03 After Mrs. Jaggard I set Mr. Maes to singing, but he did it so like a coxcomb that I was sick of him.

1664-02-19 21:47 Mrs. Jaggard did at my entreaty play on the Vyall, but so well as I did not think any woman in England could and but few Maisters.

1664-02-19 20:32 To Jaggard’s again, where a very good supper and great store of plate.

1664-02-19 18:10 To visit my Ladys Jemimah and Paulina Montagu, whom we find at their father’s new house in Lincolne’s Inn Fields; but the house all in dirt.

1664-02-19 14:34 To Mr. Jaggard, a salter, in Thames Street, for whom I did a courtesy among the poor victuallers.

1664-02-19 10:03 Mr. Cutler did tell me several excellent examples of men raised upon the ‘Change by their great diligence and saving.

1664-02-19 00:05 I home and by daylight to bed about 6 o’clock and fell to sleep, wakened about 12 when my wife came to bed.

1664-02-18 16:24 After doing a little business at the office I wrote to my father about sending him the mastiff was given me yesterday.

1664-02-18 13:32 With Mr. Coventry to the African House, and fell to my Lord Peterborough’s accounts, and by and by to dinner, where excellent discourse.

1664-02-18 08:52 Much against my will I rose, my head aching mightily, and to the office, where I did argue to good purpose for the King.

1664-02-18 04:36 I eat and drank a little, and to bed, weary, sleepy, cold, and my head akeing.

1664-02-18 04:09 With my business brought to some good understanding, and set it down pretty clear, I went home to bed with my mind at good quiet.

1664-02-18 04:04 I sat up till now, all alone, cold, and my candle not enough left to light me to my owne house.

1664-02-18 02:15 Out of an impatience to breake up with my head full of confused notions, but nothing brought to a comprehension, I was resolved to sit up.

1664-02-17 23:56 Sir W. Rider came and staid with me, having found ourselves work about understanding the measuring of Mr. Wood’s masts.

1664-02-17 21:57 I spent much time this evening in discourse with Mr. Cutler, who tells me how the Dutch deal with us abroad and do not value us any where.

1664-02-17 13:46 Home and dined, where I found an excellent mastiffe, his name Towser, sent me by a chyrurgeon.

1664-02-17 08:10 Setting my wife down by her father’s in Long Acre, in so ill looked a place, among all the whore houses, that I was troubled at it.

1664-02-16 22:57 I to my Vyall a little, which I have not done some months, I think, before, and then a little to my office.

1664-02-16 13:24 I brought Mr. Barrow to dinner, where I had a haunch of venison roasted, and so had a pretty dinner, full of discourse of his business.

1664-02-16 12:07 To the office, where very busy all the morning, and most with Mr. Wood, I vexing him about his masts.

1664-02-15 16:38 Sir Thomas Chamberlin showed me letters from the East Indys showing the height that the Dutch are come to, showing scorn to all the English.

1664-02-15 11:07 To the ‘Change, where newes of the arrivall of two rich ships, the Greyhound and another, which they were afeard of, and insurance given.

1664-02-15 09:18 The Duke first put on a periwigg; methought his hair cut short in order thereto did look prettily of itself, before he put on his periwigg.

1664-02-14 14:10 Home and very pleasant with my wife at dinner.

1664-02-14 11:07 To church alone, where a lazy sermon of Mr. Mills, upon a text to introduce catechizing in his parish, which I perceive he intends to begin.

1664-02-13 16:32 To Reeves, the perspective glass maker, and did see excellent microscopes, which did discover a louse or sand most perfectly and largely.

1664-02-12 15:10 With my wife and called at Alderman Backewell’s and changed Mr. Falconer’s state-cup, that he did give us the other day, for a fair tankard.

1664-02-12 13:49 Having a good dinner and the opening of my lampry (cutting a notch on one side), which proved very good.

1664-02-11 13:33 Home to dinner, my wife and I hand to fist to a very fine pig.

1664-02-11 12:10 Mr. Falconer visited my wife, and brought her a present, a silver state-cup and cover, value about 3l. or 4l., for the courtesy I did him.

1664-02-10 16:20 I did give my wife 10s. to give her brother, and a coat that I had by me, a close-bodied light-coloured cloth coat, with a gold edgeing.

1664-02-10 16:10 My wife’s brother is going this next tide with his wife into Holland to seek his fortune.

1664-02-10 08:55 To my Lord Sandwich, to his new house, a fine house, but deadly dear, in Lincoln’s Inne Fields, where I found and spoke a little to him.

1664-02-09 19:22 My wife and I did cast about how to get Capt. Grove for my sister, in which we are earnest at present, and I think it would be a good match.

1664-02-09 15:03 Hawly and I talked of his mistress, Mrs. Lane, and I seriously advising him, and do believe that I shall bring them together.

1664-02-09 13:10 Matters are made up between the Pope and the King of France; so that now all the doubt is, what the French will do with their armies.

1664-02-09 12:52 Great talke of the Dutch proclaiming themselves in India, Lords of the Southern Seas, and deny traffick there to all ships but their owne.

1664-02-08 15:33 I did look upon pictures which Cade, the stationer, promised to give me the buying of, but I found he would have played the Jacke with me.

1664-02-08 10:04 The King do doat upon the Duke of Monmouth, apparently as one that he intends to have succeed him. God knows what will be the end of it!

1664-02-08 09:46 The Queen will stop before she goes into her dressing-room till she knows whether the King be there, for fear he should be with Mrs Stewart.

1664-02-07 20:43 Up to my wife, and with great mirth read Sir W. Davenant’s two speeches in dispraise of London and Paris, by way of reproach one to another.

1664-02-06 17:48 Home, calling at my cozen Scott’s who (she) lies dying, they say, upon a miscarriage. My wife could not be admitted to see her, nor anybody.

1664-02-06 13:47 Father Fogourdy confirms to me the newes that for certain there is peace between the Pope and King of France.

1664-02-06 13:23 Came one Father Fogourdy, a discreet person, but one that I would not have converse with my wife for fear of meddling with her religion.

1664-02-05 14:44 After dinner by water home, all the way going and coming reading “Faber Fortunae,” which I can never read too often.

1664-02-05 10:55 Down by water, a brave morning, to Woolwich, and spent an houre or two to good purpose, and so walked to Greenwich and thence to Deptford.

1664-02-04 17:58 My wife telling me a story how her mayd Jane going into the boat did fall down and show her arse in the boat.

1664-02-04 16:02 To my bookseller’s and there spent an hour looking over Theatrum Urbium and Flandria illustrata, with excellent cuts, with great content.

1664-02-04 10:03 By coach to Paul’s School, where I heard some good speeches of the boys that were to be elected this year.

1664-02-03 21:44 God forgive me! what thoughts and wishes I had of being in their place.

1664-02-03 21:43 They seek to drag her by some force, but the wench went, and I believe had her turn served.

1664-02-03 21:42 Coming up Ludgate Hill I saw two gallants and their footmen taking a pretty wench, which I have much eyed, lately set up shop upon the hill.

1664-02-02 22:32 To the office, where doing infinite of business till past 10 at night to the comfort of my mind, and so home with joy to supper and to bed.

1664-02-02 14:48 I could eat no victuals almost for dinner for joy to think how God do bless us every day more and more.

1664-02-02 14:05 My wife being gone, it proves a payre of white gloves for her and forty pieces in good gold, which did so cheer my heart.

1664-02-02 13:40 Sir W. Warren did give me a payre of gloves for my wife wrapt up in paper, which I would not open, feeling it hard.

1664-02-02 12:52 To the Coffee-house with Captain Cocke, who discoursed well of the good effects in some kind of a Dutch warr and conquest.

1664-02-01 18:59 I heard Lt. Coll. Baron tell good stories of his travels over the high hills in Asia above the clouds, how clear the heaven is above them.

1664-02-01 17:08 “The Indian Queen” is a most pleasant show, and beyond my expectation; the play good, but spoiled with the ryme, which breaks the sense.

1664-02-01 17:04 I took my wife out to the King’s Theatre, it being a new month, and once a month I may go, and there saw “The Indian Queene” acted.

1664-02-01 11:54 Gresham College the King mightily laughed at, for spending time only in weighing of ayre, and doing nothing else since they sat.

1664-02-01 11:50 The King stayed an hour or two laughing at Sir W. Petty, who was there about his boat; at which poor Petty was, I perceive, at some loss.

1664-02-01 09:45 I hear how two men last night, justling for the wall about the New Exchange, did kill one another, each thrusting the other through.

1664-02-01 09:20 I found my Lord gone out. I am glad to see that he attends his business, though it troubles me that my counsel must be the cause of it.
