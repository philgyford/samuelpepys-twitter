1664-12-31 23:52 I judged it fit to look over my papers; and to tear all not to be worth keeping, or fit to be seen if it should please God to take me away.

1664-12-31 23:33 Publique matters are all in a hurry about a Dutch warr. Our preparations great; our provocations against them great.

1664-12-31 23:10 My credit in the world and my office grows daily, and I am in good esteeme with everybody, I think.

1664-12-31 22:22 I am at a loss to know whether it be my hare’s foote or taking every morning a pill of turpentine or having left off the wearing of a gowne.

1664-12-31 22:20 I bless God I never have been in so good plight as to my health in so very cold weather as this is, these ten years, as I am at this day.

1664-12-30 14:15 I paid my bookseller 6l. for books I had from him this day, and the silversmith 22l. 18s. for spoons, forks, and sugar box.

1664-12-30 09:30 My wife very full of a resolution to keep within doors, not so much as to go to church or see my Lady Sandwich before Easter next.

1664-12-29 16:36 I began to wipe and clean my books in my chamber in order to the settling of my papers and things there thoroughly.

1664-12-29 14:04 Whereas I should have dined with Sir W. Pen (and the officers), I pretended to dine with my Lady Sandwich and so home, where I dined well.

1664-12-28 22:45 To my office late, then home to bed, leaving my wife and people up to more sports, but without any great satisfaction to myself therein.

1664-12-28 10:23 I to the Council Chamber, where all of us to discourse about the way of measuring ships and the freight fit to give for them by the tun.

1664-12-28 08:05 My wife to bed at eight o’clock in the morning, which vexed me a little, but I believe there was no hurt in it all, but only mirth.

1664-12-28 05:55 I waked and my wife not come to bed; I lacked a pot, but there was none, and bitter cold, so was forced to rise and piss in the chimney.

1664-12-27 22:15 I went to bed, leaving my wife and all her folks, and Will also, too, come to make Christmas gambolls to-night.

1664-12-27 13:45 To Sir J. Minnes’s to dinner by appointment, where all yesterday’s company but Mr. Coventry, who could not come.

1664-12-27 07:25 My people came to bed, after their sporting, at four o’clock in the morning; I up at seven, and to Deptford and Woolwich in a gally.

1664-12-26 22:10 Home to bed, where my people and wife innocently at cards very merry, and I to bed, leaving them to their sport and blindman’s buff.

1664-12-26 16:30 To Sir W. Batten’s, where Mr. Coventry and all our families here, and Sir R. Ford and his, and a great feast and good discourse and merry.

1664-12-26 12:40 To the Coffeehouse, and all the opinion is that the Dutch will avoid fighting with us at home, but do all the hurte they can to us abroad.

1664-12-26 09:50 To White Hall, and then with Sir W. Batten back and to his house, where I by sicknesse excused my wife’s coming to them to-day.

1664-12-25 22:10 So home and to my chamber, looking over and setting in order my papers and books, and so to supper, and then to prayers and to bed.

1664-12-25 15:40 To Mr. Rawlinson’s church, where I heard a good sermon; and great store of fine women there is, more than I know anywhere else about us.

1664-12-25 09:04 Up (my wife’s eye being ill still of the blow I did in a passion give her) to church alone, where Mr. Mills, a good sermon.

1664-12-24 18:04 I saw the Comet which is now, whether worn away or no I know not, but appears not with a tail only is larger and duller than any other star.

1664-12-24 15:15 To my bookseller’s, and there saw several books I spoke for, which are finely bound and good books to my great content.

1664-12-24 12:50 I heard Sir Richard Ford tell the story of our defeat at Guinny. Wherein our men are guilty of the most horrid cowardice and perfidiousness.

1664-12-24 02:45 My boy and I to Tower Hill, it being a most fine, bright moonshine night, and a great frost; but no Comet to be seen.

1664-12-24 02:10 Our porter, being appointed, comes and tells us that the bellman tells him that the star is seen upon Tower Hill.

1664-12-23 20:55 It being a bright night I purpose to endeavour to be called in the morning to see the Comet, though I fear we shall not see it.

1664-12-23 17:31 God make me thankfull and carefull to preserve myself so, for I am sure they hate me and it is hope or fear that makes them flatter me.

1664-12-23 17:30 Sir W. Batten sent and afterwards spoke to me, to have me and my wife come and dine with them: which is a mighty condescension in them.

1664-12-23 14:12 The King of France do declare himself obliged to defend the Dutch, and more, it is doubted whether the Swede will be our friend or no.

1664-12-23 14:10 I hear that the Dutch have prepared a fleete to go the backway to the Streights, where without doubt they will master our fleete.

1664-12-22 15:05 I took boat down to Redriffe; and saw the new vessel of Sir William Petty’s launched. It swims and looks finely, and I believe will do well.

1664-12-22 10:40 To the ’Change; and there, among the merchants, I hear fully the news of our being beaten to dirt at Guinny, by De Ruyter with his fleete.

1664-12-22 08:55 I to a barber’s shop, and there met with a copy of verses, mightily commended, of my Lord Mordaunt’s. But, Lord! they are but sorry things.

1664-12-21 19:20 My Lord Sandwich writes me word that he hath seen (at Portsmouth) the Comet, and says it is the most extraordinary thing that ever he saw.

1664-12-21 10:05 I carried Mrs Turner our eagle, which she desired the other day, and we were glad to be rid of her she fouling our house of office mightily.

1664-12-20 13:02 I sent him abroad, and alone avec elle je tentoy à faire ce que je voudrais et contre sa force je le faisoy bien que pas à mon contentment.

1664-12-20 12:34 I was very kindly used, and the poor people did get a dinner for me in their fashion, of which I also eat very well.

1664-12-20 11:10 Walked to Deptford, where after doing something at the yard I walked, without being observed, with Bagwell home to his house.

1664-12-19 21:42 My mind too much upon what I can faire avec la femme de Bagwell having promised to go to Deptford and à aller à sa maison avec son mari.

1664-12-19 21:10 My wife was forced to lay a poultice or something to her eye all day, and is black, and the people of the house observed it.

1664-12-19 15:32 To an alehouse and endeavoured to caress Bagwell’s wife, but elle ne voulait pas, but I think it was not having a good place to do it upon.

1664-12-19 14:55 I walked round the fields again and again, but not finding Bagwell’s wife I to the ‘Change, and found her waiting for me and took her away.

1664-12-19 14:28 Bagwell’s wife being come I bid her go to Mooregate. After going to my wife (whose eye is bad but she is in good temper), I to the place.

1664-12-19 04:38 I sent for butter and parsley, and friends presently one with another, and I up, vexed at my heart to think what I had done.

1664-12-19 04:17 My wife’s spirit was such as to endeavour to bite and scratch me. But I coying with her made her leave crying.

1664-12-19 04:12 My wife giving me some cross answer I did strike her over her left eye such a blow as the poor wretch did cry out and was in great pain.

1664-12-19 04:10 I begun to find fault with my wife for not commanding her servants as she ought.

1664-12-19 04:05 We waked betimes, and from our people’s being forced to take the key to go out to light a candle, I was very angry.

1664-12-18 20:34 Mr. Andrews and Hill come and we sung finely, and Mr. Fuller, the Parson, and supped with me, but my musique friends would not stay supper.

1664-12-18 09:10 To church, where, God forgive me! I spent my time in looking my new Morena at the other side of the church, an acquaintance of Pegg Pen’s.

1664-12-17 20:24 To-night I thought to have seen this Comet too; but it is cloudy, and so no stars appear. But I will endeavour it.

1664-12-17 20:22 Mighty talke there is of this Comet that is seen a’nights; and the King and Queene did sit up last night to see it, and did, it seems.

1664-12-17 17:44 Mr. Povy did in discourse give me a rub about my late bill for money that I did get of him, which vexed me and stuck in my mind.

1664-12-17 14:14 Come the looking-glass man to set up the looking-glass I bought yesterday, in my dining-room, and very handsome it is.

1664-12-17 12:35 I had my first meeting with Mr. L’Estrange. He is a man of fine conversation, I think, but I am sure most courtly and full of compliments.

1664-12-16 14:33 Abroad with my wife, and bought a looking glasse by the Old Exchange, which costs me 5l. 5s. and 6s. for the hooks. A very fair glasse.

1664-12-16 09:29 I am well informed that Mr. Castle’s fine knees, lately delivered in, are not as they should be to make them knees.

1664-12-15 21:44 I begun to burn wax candles in my closett at the office, to try the charge and to see whether the smoke offends like that of tallow candles.
.
1664-12-15 11:12 To the Coffeehouse, where great talke of the Comet seen in several places; and among our men at sea, and by my Lord Sandwich.

1664-12-15 09:55 To Moorfields, and up and down to several houses to look for a place pour rencontrer la femme de je sais quoi, but could meet none.

1664-12-15 08:47 Mr. Cholmly tells me the King do hate my Lord Chancellor; and that the King and my Lord FitzHarding do laugh at him for a dull fellow.

1664-12-15 08:10 It seems, of all mankind there is no man so led by another as the Duke is by Lord Muskerry and this FitzHarding.

1664-12-14 23:02 Home to supper and to bed, not being very well through my taking cold of late, and so troubled with some wind.

1664-12-14 19:28 I spoke for some fruit for my father, and where should I do it but at the pretty woman’s that used to stand at the door in Fanchurch Street.

1664-12-14 09:58 To my bookseller’s, and there spoke for several books against New Year’s day, I resolving to lay out about 7l. or 8l.

1664-12-13 08:58 Lay long in bed, then up, and many people to speak with me.

1664-12-12 15:20 Comes Cutler to tell us that the King of France hath forbid any canvass to be carried out of his kingdom.

1664-12-12 14:32 To the office, where my Lord Brunkard reads over our Instructions in the Navy — and I expounded it to him, so he is become my disciple.

1664-12-11 16:40 It is strange how these Psalms of Ravenscroft after 2 or 3 times singing prove but the same again. No diversity appearing at all almost.

1664-12-11 16:17 Home, and there found Mr. Andrews and his lady, a well-bred and a tolerable pretty woman, and by and by Mr. Hill and to singing.

1664-12-11 15:42 Here was Sir Samuel Morland and his lady very fine, with two footmen in new liverys, going into their coach after sermon with great gazeing.

1664-12-11 15:20 To the French church, where much pleased with the three sisters of the parson, very handsome, especially in their noses, and sing prettily.

1664-12-10 14:03 Hearing newes of so many Dutchmen being brought in to Portsmouth, which it is expected will either put them upon present revenge or despair.

1664-12-10 12:28 A modest civil person my Lord Brunkard seems to be, but wholly ignorant in the business of the Navy as possible.

1664-12-10 07:48 Lay long, at which I am ashamed, because of so many people observing it that know not how late I sit up.

1664-12-10 01:14 To my office, setting to rights in writing this day’s two accounts of Povy and Taylor, and then quietly to bed.

1664-12-09 15:29 Though I took occasion of going to the Trumpet Jane declined coming. ‘Je avait grande envie envers elle, avec vrai amour et passion’.

1664-12-09 15:27 I to Westminster Hall, and thence to Gervas’s, and there find I cannot prevail with Jane to go forth with me.

1664-12-09 10:15 Captain Taylor and I did set even the business of the ship Union, wherein I hope to get 50l. more, for all which the Lord be praised.

1664-12-09 08:17 It overbears me on one side with joy and on the other to think of my condition if I shall be called into examination about it.

1664-12-09 08:15 To Mr. Povy’s. I got a note, and went and received 117l. 5s. of Alderman Viner upon my pretended freight of the “William” for Tangier.

1664-12-08 20:05 Comes my aunt and uncle Wight, Mrs. Norbury, and her daughter, where no great pleasure, my aunt being out of humour in her fine clothes.

1664-12-07 15:32 To White Hall, and we waited on the Duke, who looks better than he did before his voyage; and a little more stern than he used to do.

1664-12-07 09:20 Lay long, then up, and among others Bagwell’s wife coming to speak with me put new thoughts of folly into me which I am troubled at.

1664-12-06 12:57 Mrs. Lane is great with child, and she says I must be godfather, but I do not intend it.

1664-12-06 12:55 After many discourses and Mrs. Lane intreating me to do something for her husband, which I promised to do, I took leave.

1664-12-06 12:45 I made Mrs. Lane go home, and by and by followed her, and there did what I would with her.

1664-12-06 12:11 To Westminster Hall. Mrs. Lane plucks me by the cloak to speak to me, and I was fain to go to her shop, and pretending to buy some bands.

1664-12-05 20:02 I to White Hall, and there saw Mr. Coventry come to towne, and, with all my heart, am glad to see him, but could have no talke with him.

1664-12-05 18:40 I find Mrs. The., but not as I expected, but pleased I am to hear the mother commend her daughter Betty that she is like to be a beauty.

1664-12-05 18:15 We all, it being night, in Madam Turner’s coach to her house, there to see, as she tells us, how fat Mrs. The. is grown.

1664-12-05 09:50 Up, and to White Hall with Sir J. Minnes; and there, among an infinite crowd of great persons, did kiss the Duke’s hand.

1664-12-04 09:12 Lay long in bed, and then up and to my office, there to dispatch a business in order to the getting something out of the Tangier business.

1664-12-03 16:45 The Dutch are all drawn into their harbours. But it seems like a victory: and a matter of some reputation to us it is, and blemish to them.

1664-12-03 16:36 The Duke of Yorke being expected to-night with great joy from Portsmouth after having been abroad at sea three or four days with the fleete.

1664-12-03 15:25 My Lord Barkeley was there, but is the most hot, fiery man in discourse, without any cause, that ever I saw.

1664-12-03 15:15 To a Committee of the Fishery; only to hear Sir Edward Ford’s proposal about farthings wherein, O God! to see every body interested for him.

1664-12-02 20:20 Sat and talked, where good discourse of the late troubles, they knowing things, all of them, very well.

1664-12-02 19:15 To my office, whither comes Captain Cocke, and then Sir W. Batten, and we all to Sir J. Minnes, and I did give them a barrel of oysters.

1664-12-02 17:50 Homeward, and the coach broke with us in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and so walked to Fleete Streete, and there took coach and home.

1664-12-02 17:10 To the Duke’s House, and saw “The Rivalls”; but the play not good, nor anything but the good actings of Betterton and his wife and Harris.

1664-12-01 09:10 Up betimes and to White Hall to a Committee of Tangier, and so straight home and hard to my business at my office.
