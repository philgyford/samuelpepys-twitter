1664-04-30 23:58 So my people being all abed I put myself to bed very sleepy.

1664-04-30 23:53 Never more quiet in my family, there being only my wife and I and Besse and the little girl Susan, the best wenches that we can ever expect.

1664-04-30 23:50 Home about my month’s accounts, wherein I have just kept within compass, this having been a spending month.

1664-04-30 21:50 Wrote to my father my continued displeasure against my brother John, so that I will give him nothing more out of my own purse.

1664-04-30 12:39 Sir W. Rider and Cutler took me to the Old James and did give me a good dish of mackerell, the first I have seen this year, very good.

1664-04-29 19:42 Comes Mr. Hill, and we sung some things, and good musique it seemed to me, only my mind too full of business to have much pleasure in it.

1664-04-29 15:04 My Lady hath the meazles, and I fear the small pox, poor lady. It grieves me; for it will be a sad houre to the family should she miscarry.

1664-04-28 22:07 Tired with business and without joy otherwise than that I am by God’s grace enabled to go through it and one day hope to have benefit by it.

1664-04-27 20:47 Concluding in the business of Wood’s masts, which I believe I have taken more pains in than any Principall officer in this world ever did.

1664-04-27 15:20 The Houses attended the King, and delivered their votes to him: upon the business of the Dutch; and he promises an answer in writing.

1664-04-27 12:15 Up, and all the morning very busy with multitude of clients, till my head began to be overloaded.

1664-04-26 15:00 To the Old Exchange by coach, where great newes and true, I saw by written letters, of strange fires seen at Amsterdam in the ayre.

1664-04-26 12:40 I walked to the New Exchange, and there had a most delicate dish of curds and creame, and discourse with the good woman of the house.

1664-04-26 10:04 My Lady Peters, my Lord says, is a drunken jade, he himself having seen her drunk in the lobby of their House.

1664-04-25 18:52 And so through Kingsland again, and so to Bishopsgate, and so home with great pleasure. The country mighty pleasant.

1664-04-25 17:49 Thence to Islington, and so to St John’s to the Red Bull, and there saw the latter part of a rude prize fought, with good pleasure enough.

1664-04-25 16:59 Then to Newington Green, and saw the outside of Mrs. Herbert’s house, where she lived, and my Aunt Ellen with her.

1664-04-25 16:22 Thence to Kingsland, by my nurse’s house, Goody Lawrence, where my brother Tom and I was kept when young.

1664-04-25 15:32 I took my wife out at White Chapel, and to Bednal Green; so to Hackney, where I have not been many a year, since a child I boarded there.

1664-04-25 14:10 Mr. Moore told me my Lord runs in debt every day more and more, and takes little care how to come out of it.

1664-04-25 09:58 In the Duke’s chamber there is a bird, from the East Indys; talks many things and neyes like the horse, the best that ever I heard.

1664-04-25 09:05 To the Duke, and after he was ready to his closet, where most of our talke about a Dutch warr, and discoursing of things indeed now for it.

1664-04-24 12:04 Up, and all the morning in my chamber setting some of my private papers in order.

1664-04-23 17:09 All the afternoon, not being well, at my office, and there doing much business, my thoughts still running upon a warr and my money.

1664-04-23 13:20 I and my wife much troubled about my money that is in my Lord Sandwich’s hand, for fear of his going to sea and be killed.

1664-04-23 11:15 Talked with Sir W. Warren of Castle’s ill language of me behind my back, saying that I favour my fellow traytours. I shall be even with him.

1664-04-22 15:55 Here I saw Mrs. Bendy, my Lady Spillman’s faire daughter that was, who continues yet very handsome.

1664-04-22 15:42 Mrs. The., my wife and I, in their coach to Hide Parke where great plenty of gallants, and pleasant it was, only for the dust.

1664-04-22 06:25 I walked with great pleasure to Woolwich, in my way staying several times to listen to the nightingales.

1664-04-22 05:50 By water against tide, it being a little coole, to Greenwich; it was somewhat foggy till the sun got to some height.

1664-04-21 14:17 Running up I perceive by my dear Lady blushing that in my dining-room she was doing something upon the pott, which I also was ashamed of.

1664-04-21 14:15 To the office, but no sooner sat but news comes my Lady Sandwich was come to see us, so I went out.

1664-04-21 10:30 I calling with my wife at a place or two to inquire after a couple of mayds recommended to us, but we found both of them bad.

1664-04-20 21:22 At night comes my aunt and uncle Wight and Nan Ferrers and supped merrily with me, my uncle coming in an hour after them almost foxed.

1664-04-20 11:03 Calling for Lawes’s Psalms, which I did not so much (by being against my oath) buy as lay down money till others be bound better for me.

1664-04-19 20:48 With Captain Tayler consulting how to get a little money by letting him the Elias to fetch masts from New England.

1664-04-19 12:05 The ’Change full of news from Guinny, some say the Dutch have sunk our ships and taken our fort. Others say we have done the same to them.

1664-04-19 10:35 I to walk with Creed and Vernaty in the Physique Garden in St. James’s Parke; where I first saw orange-trees, and other fine trees.

1664-04-19 09:59 To St James’s where with Mr. Coventry, Povy, &c, in their Tangier accounts, but such the folly of that coxcomb Povy that we could do little.

1664-04-18 16:50 Myself being in a hackney and full of people, was ashamed to be seen by the world, many of them knowing me.

1664-04-18 16:42 I saw the King with his periwigg, but not altered at all; and my Lady Castlemayne in a coach by herself, in yellow satin and a pinner on.

1664-04-18 16:20 With my wife and my aunt Wight and Mrs. Hunt and a kinswoman of theirs, Mrs. Steward, to Hide Parke, where I have not been since last year.

1664-04-18 11:48 To the ’Change; and do hear that a Jew hath put in a policy of four per cent to any man, to insure him against a Dutch warr for four months.

1664-04-17 15:33 I did go to church with my wife, where a young simple fellow did preach: I slept soundly all the sermon.

1664-04-17 09:30 Pembleton was here to-day, but I think sat so as he could not see my wife, which did please me, God help me!

1664-04-17 08:46 The truth is, my jealousy hath hindered it, for fear my wife should see Pembleton.

1664-04-17 08:45 I put on my black suit and my velvet cloake, and with my wife in her laced suit to church, where we have not been these nine or ten weeks.

1664-04-16 16:55 I home, and found my wife and Besse gone over the water to Half-way house, and after them, but it was too late, so eat a cake and home.

1664-04-16 13:44 With Mr Coventry, Sir W Rider, the simple Povy, of all the most ridiculous foole, Creed and Vernatty, about my Lord Peterborough’s accounts.

1664-04-15 17:40 Never was any thing so well done in earnest, worse performed in jest upon the stage.

1664-04-15 17:38 With my wife by coach to the Duke’s house, and there saw “The German Princess” acted, by the woman herself.

1664-04-15 12:43 I met with Mr. Hill, with whom, I perceive, I shall contract a musical acquaintance; but I will make it as little troublesome as I can.

1664-04-15 11:06 I showed Captain Taylor my letters to Mr. Coventry, wherein he acknowledges that nobody did ever understand so much as I have done.

1664-04-14 19:42 My mind a little vexed, but yet without reason, for I shall prevail, I hope, for the King’s profit.

1664-04-14 08:22 With Mr. Coventry and Povy, &c, about my Lord Peterborough’s accounts, but, Lord! to see still what a puppy that Povy is with all his show.

1664-04-14 06:51 I took leave of my father, being much afeard I shall not see him here any more, he do decay so much every day.

1664-04-13 10:48 Mr. Coventry says those that are forward for a warr, they are reported in the world to be designers of getting money into the King’s hands.

1664-04-13 10:30 To talk of our business with the Dutch; Mr. Coventry tells me fully that he believes it will not come to a warr.

1664-04-12 16:27 To Mr. Pagett’s, and heard some musique not very good, but only one Dr. Walgrave, who plays the best upon the lute that I ever heard man.

1664-04-12 13:33 How I used to adore Mr. Cole’s talke, and now methinks he is but an ordinary man, his son a pretty boy indeed, but his nose unhappily awry.

1664-04-12 12:42 To my uncle Wight’s, where dined my father, poor melancholy man, that used to be as full of life as anybody.

1664-04-12 10:24 I would be glad to get W. Howe secretary and to out Creed if I can, for he is a crafty and false rogue.

1664-04-12 10:12 W. Howe and I to the Coffee-house, where we sat talking about getting of him some place under my Lord of advantage if he should go to sea.

1664-04-11 14:08 Dined at home, being myself not yet thorough well, making water with some pain, but better than I was, and all my fear of an ague gone away.

1664-04-10 18:32 We spent the day in pleasant talks and company one with another, reading in Dr. Fuller’s book what he says of the Cliffords and Kingsmills.

1664-04-10 11:40 My wife’s taylor brought home her new laced silks gowns with a smaller lace, and new petticoats, I bought the other day both very pretty.

1664-04-10 10:32 I not being so well as to go out, my wife, though much against her will, staid at home with me.

1664-04-10 07:02 By the help of Mithrydate I slept very well.

1664-04-09 20:43 I drank a glass or two of Hypocras, and to the office to dispatch some business, necessary, and so home and to bed.

1664-04-09 19:20 To my father’s and spoke one word with him, and thence home, where I found myself sick in my stomach and vomited, which I do not use to do.

1664-04-09 12:10 I continued cold and apt to shake all the morning.

1664-04-09 06:15 I did wake about one o’clock in the morning, and pissed with great pain, continued sleepy, but in a high fever all night, and in some pain.

1664-04-08 22:04 To walk in the garden with my wife, and to my office a while, and then to the only Lenten supper I have had of wiggs and ale, and so to bed.

1664-04-08 13:24 I put into a cane shop and bought one to walk with, cost me 4s. 6d., all of one joint.

1664-04-07 14:45 To dinner, where my wife got me a pleasant French fricassee of veal for dinner, and thence to the office.

1664-04-07 13:03 Talke of the Dutch’s protest against our Royall Company in Guinny and their granting letters of marke against us. Every body expects a warr.

1664-04-06 12:22 I all the morning in my office busy, and at noon home to dinner mightily oppressed with wind.

1664-04-06 08:25 She was brought to bed in St. Sepulchre’s parish of two children; one is dead, the other is alive; her name Elizabeth, and goes by Taylor.

1664-04-06 08:20 My father’s old servant told me he had been serviceable to my brother Tom, in the business of his getting his servant, Margaret, with child.

1664-04-05 17:45 The poor wretch took it ill, and I believe besides wringing her nose she did feel pain, and so cried, but by and by I made her friends.

1664-04-05 17:32 My wife answering me some way that I did not like I pulled her by the nose, to offend her, though afterwards to appease her I denied it.

1664-04-05 15:58 I went to W. Joyce, where I find the order come, and bayle given; and he paying his fees: which, I hope, will teach him to hold his tongue.

1664-04-05 13:03 I heard the King’s speech to the House; but he speaks the worst that ever I heard man in my life, worse than if he read it all.

1664-04-05 12:12 At last it was carried that W. Joyce should be bayled till the House meets again after Easter, he giving bond for his appearance.

1664-04-05 11:22 Lord Peterborough presented a petition to the House from W. Joyce: and a great dispute, we hear, there was in the House for and against it.

1664-04-05 09:50 I staid an hour or two and wrote over a fresh petition, that which was drawn by their solicitor not pleasing me.

1664-04-05 08:00 With Anthony Joyce to his brother Will, where I find him pretty cheery over he was yesterday (like a coxcomb), his wife being come to him.

1664-04-04 14:20 To the Duke’s, where discourse of the condition of the Fleete, in order to a Dutch warr, for that the Duke hath a mind it should come to.

1664-04-04 11:32 Who would have thought that W Joyce should be so daunted as not to know what he said, and now to cry like a child. It is strange to observe.

1664-04-04 11:10 The Sergeant of the Black Rod did direct a messenger to take W. Joyce in custody, and so he was conducted to the Swan with two Necks.

1664-04-04 10:59 W. Joyce was called in; and I find he did speak all he said to his disadvantage, and so was committed to the Black Rod: which is very hard.

1664-04-04 10:35 I saw my Lady Peters, an impudent jade, soliciting all the Lords on her behalf.

1664-04-04 10:27 To Westminster, to the Painted Chamber, and met the two Joyces. I to the Lords’ House before they sat; and stood within it a good while.

1664-04-04 09:02 I can yet discern a coldness in my Lord Sandwich to admit me to any discourse with him.

1664-04-03 16:10 My wife sent for me, to see her new laced gowne, that is her gown that is new laced; and indeed it becomes her very nobly, and is well made.

1664-04-03 10:32 W. Joyce’s business was to ask advice of me, he being summonsed to the House of Lords for endeavouring to arrest my Lady Peters for a debt.

1664-04-02 16:15 Looking over two ships now in building, and am resolved to learn something of the art, for I find it is not hard and very usefull.

1664-04-02 13:45 Sir Thomas Chamberlin tells me that it is very probable, as well as most necessary, that we fall out with the Dutch.

1664-04-02 12:53 It is hard not only to tell how we know when we do a thing really or in a dream, but also to know the difference between one and the other.

1664-04-02 12:52 Discourse with Sir W. Petty, who proposed a thing that is truly questionable, whether there be any difference between waking and dreaming.

1664-04-02 09:10 That doating fool Sir J. Minnes says whatever Sir W. Batten says, though never minding whether to the King’s profit or not.

1664-04-01 20:48 I was at it to-night, but durst not stay long at it, I being come to have a great pain and water in my eyes after candle-light.

1664-04-01 17:57 Mrs. Turner did lend me a manuscript of one Mr. Wells, writ long ago, teaching the method of building a ship, which pleases me mightily.

1664-04-01 15:42 The Duke of York called me to him. I perceive doth much wish that the Parliament will find reason to fall out with the Dutch.

1664-04-01 15:04 I saw the Queene going to the Parke: she herself looks ill, and methinks Mrs. Stewart is grown fatter, and not so fair as she was.

1664-04-01 12:35 To the ’Change. I found all the merchants concerned with the presenting their complaints to the Committee of Parliament against the Dutch.
