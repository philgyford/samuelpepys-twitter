1664-08-31 22:15 So home and to bed.

1664-08-31 22:05 Well in health, since I left off wearing of a gowne within doors all day, and then go out with my legs into the cold, which brought me pain.

1664-08-31 21:57 To my office, where casting up my monthly accounts, and, blessed be God! find myself worth 1020l, which is still the most I ever was worth.

1664-08-31 14:47 I up to hear my boy play upon a lute, which I have this day borrowed of Mr Hunt; indeed the boy would, with little practice, play very well.

1664-08-31 12:32 Home to dinner, and there my wife hath got me some pretty good oysters, which is very soon and the soonest, I think, I ever eat any.

1664-08-31 12:09 All the morning very busy at my office.

1664-08-31 09:24 Prince Rupert is to go to command this fleete going to Guinny against the Dutch. I doubt few will be pleased with his going.

1664-08-30 15:10 I perceive something of learning Mr. Pen hath got, but a great deale of the vanity of the French garbe and affected manner of speech.

1664-08-30 15:08 After dinner comes Mr. Pen to visit me, and staid an houre talking with me.

1664-08-29 16:10 I home, and thither came the woman with her mother which our Will recommends to my wife. I like her well, and I think will please us.

1664-08-29 13:28 My Lady Sandwich is become as handsome, I think, as ever she was; and so good and discreet a woman I know not in the world.

1664-08-29 06:10 I took a boat and down, and found, by God’s providence, the fire out; but if there had been any wind it must have burned all our stores.

1664-08-29 05:03 Mr. Hughes told me that as he came from Deptford he left the King’s yarde a-fire.

1664-08-28 22:10 Merry to think how Mr. Holliard (who came this evening to see me) makes nothing, but proving as a most clear thing that Rome is Antichrist.

1664-08-28 12:47 Home to dinner, and there met Creed, and we merry together, as his learning is such and judgment that I cannot but be pleased with it.

1664-08-28 08:50 Up and with my boy alone to church, the first time I have had anybody to attend me to church a great while.

1664-08-27 21:27 All the newes is that the Dutch are, with twenty-two sayle of ships of warr, crewsing up and down about Ostend; at which we are alarmed.

1664-08-27 18:04 I find my boy a very schoole boy, that talks innocently and impertinently, but it is a sport to us, and in a little time he will leave it.

1664-08-27 16:33 I called Will and told him my reason of taking a boy, and that it is of necessity, not out of any unkindness to him.

1664-08-27 15:42 I propose to make a clerke of Tom Edwards, and if he deserves well, to do well by him.

1664-08-27 15:40 I home, and there find my boy, Tom Edwards, come, sent me by Captain Cooke, having been bred in the King’s Chappell these four years.

1664-08-27 14:22 To my case-maker for my stone case, and had it to my mind, and cost me 24s, which is a great deale of money, but it pleases me.

1664-08-27 12:30 To the ’Change, and there almost made my bargain about a ship for Tangier, which will bring me in a little profit with Captain Taylor.

1664-08-26 20:20 My wife tells me Mr. Pen, Sir William’s son, is come back from France. A most modish person, grown, she says, a fine gentleman.

1664-08-26 16:55 Indeed there is both of the Queenes and Mayds of Honour (particularly Mrs. Stewart’s in a buff doublet) as good pictures as ever I saw.

1664-08-26 16:45 To one Hiseman’s, a picture drawer, a Dutchman, which is said to exceed Lilly

1664-08-26 13:15 Down by water to White Hall, by the way, at the Three Cranes, putting into an alehouse and eat a bit of bread and cheese.

1664-08-26 06:30 Down by water to Deptford, and there took in Mr. Pumpfield the rope-maker, and down with him to Woolwich to view Clothier’s cordage.

1664-08-25 08:15 I spoke to my taylor, Langford, desiring to know whether he knew of any debts that my father did owe in the City. He tells me “No, not any.”

1664-08-24 17:22 To the Wardrobe, and there saw one suit of clothes made for my boy and linen set out, and I think to have him the latter end of this week.

1664-08-24 10:45 Among the joyners in Wood Streete to buy a table and bade in many places, but did not buy it till I come home to see where it is to stand.

1664-08-23 21:30 The Dutch East India Fleete are now come home safe, which we are sorry for. Our Fleets on both sides are hastening out to Guinny.

1664-08-23 16:40 I went into New Bridewell, in my way to Mr. Cole, and there I saw the new model, and it is very handsome.

1664-08-23 15:50 Doing several errands, to comply with my oath of ending many businesses before Bartholomew’s day, which is two days hence.

1664-08-23 13:10 To the ’Change, where very busy getting ships for Guinny and for Tangier.

1664-08-23 08:20 Angry awhile about my wife desiring to have a French mayde all of a sudden, which I took to arise from yesterday’s being with her mother.

1664-08-22 16:03 To Westminster Hall, where I met with Dr. Tom Pepys, but avoided all discourse of difference with him, though much against my will.

1664-08-22 08:50 Up and abroad, doing very many errands to my great content which lay as burdens upon my mind and memory.

1664-08-21 04:15 I called Besse and sent her down to see, and it was Griffin’s maid for water to wash her house. So to sleep again.

1664-08-21 04:07 Waked, having a looseness, and peoples coming in the yard to the pump to draw water, so that fear of this day’s fire made me fearful.

1664-08-20 10:32 Sir Richard Ford, the Sheriffe, and the Mayor have power of commanding the pulling down of any house or houses, to defend the whole City.

1664-08-20 10:25 The fire hath burned many houses backward, though none forward; and that in the great uniform pile of buildings in the middle of Cheapside.

1664-08-20 10:04 I walked to Cheapside, there to see the effect of a fire there this morning, since four o’clock; which I find in the house of Mr. Bois.

1664-08-19 21:03 I to the office, where busy till supper, and home to supper to a good dish of fritters, which I bespoke, and were done much to my mind.

1664-08-19 16:35 Creed came to me, and he and I out, among other things, to look out a man to make a case, for to keep my stone, that I was cut of, in.

1664-08-19 14:55 My wife and I to Sir W. Pen’s, to see his Lady, the first time, who is a well-looked, fat, short, old Dutchwoman.

1664-08-19 12:03 Mr. Coventry and Sir W. Pen and I sat hiring of ships to go to Guinny, where we believe the warr with Holland will first break out.

1664-08-18 21:20 My wife says the play she saw is the worst that ever she saw in her life.

1664-08-18 20:15 Mr. Townsend says my boy’s clothes shall be soon done, and then I hope I shall be settled when I have one in the house that is musicall.

1664-08-18 18:55 To Westminster, and there in the Hall a while, and then to my barber, willing to have any opportunity to speak to Jane, but wanted it.

1664-08-18 13:40 Dined alone at home, my wife going to dine with Mrs. Pierce, and thence with her and. Mrs. Clerke to see a new play, “The Court Secret.”

1664-08-18 08:50 Mr. Reeve came and brought an anchor and a very fair loadstone. He would have had me bought it, and a good stone it is.

1664-08-17 17:04 Mr. Pierce believes my Lady Castlemayne has lately slunk a great belly away, for from very big she is come to be down again.

1664-08-17 15:20 I spoke with my boy Tom Edwards, and directed him to go to Mr. Townsend to have measure taken of his clothes to be made him there.

1664-08-17 11:32 My Lord Crew do much doubt that we shall fall into the Dutch war without the money or consent of Parliament.

1664-08-17 09:44 Sir W. Batten did give me three bottles of his Epsum water, which I drank and it wrought well with me, and did give me many good stools.

1664-08-16 05:15 I find not one drop of rain in my house, nor any newes of hurt done.

1664-08-16 05:05 I expected to find my house overflowed with the rain, and that much hurt must needs have been done in the city with this lightning.

1664-08-16 02:58 For a great while, not a minute’s space between new flames all the time; such a thing as I never did see.

1664-08-16 02:55 Wakened with the noise of thunder, with such continued lightnings, not flashes, but flames, that all the sky and ayre was light.

1664-08-15 17:57 It is true, the Dutchman wears high-heeled shoes, but not very high, and do generally wear a turbant, which makes him show yet taller.

1664-08-15 17:55 At Charing Crosse saw the great Dutchman that is come over, and I could not reach higher than his eye-browes with the tip of my fingers.

1664-08-15 16:22 Let Mrs. Lane brew as she has baked, seeing she would not take my counsel about Hawly.

1664-08-15 16:20 I had my pleasure Mrs. Lane, and she, like an impudent jade, depends upon my kindness to her husband but I will have no more to do with her.

1664-08-15 15:52 There begins a sad story how Mrs. Lane’s husband, as I feared, proves not worth a farthing, and that she is with child and undone.

1664-08-15 09:20 The Duke tells us how we must presently set out a fleete for Guinny, for the Dutch are doing so, and there I believe the warr will begin.

1664-08-14 20:10 W. Joyce supped with me; but a cunning, crafty fellow he is, and dangerous to displease, for his tongue spares nobody.

1664-08-14 18:29 Comes W. Joyce, in his silke suit, and cloake lined with velvett: staid talking with me, and I very merry at it.

1664-08-14 15:15 My wife and I with great pleasure, but with great difficulty before we could come to find the manner of seeing any thing by my microscope.

1664-08-14 08:34 And that I am not at all troubled with any ulcer, but my thickness of water comes from my overheat in my back.

1664-08-14 08:33 Mr. Holliard concurs with me that my pain is nothing but cold in my legs breeding wind, and got only by my using to wear a gowne.

1664-08-13 21:30 To read a little in Dr. Power’s book of discovery by the Microscope to enable me a little how to use and what to expect from my glasse.

1664-08-13 17:10 Betterton, Harris, and Ianthe’s parts are most incomparably done, and the whole play the most full of height and raptures of wit and sense.

1664-08-13 17:07 To the new play, at the Duke’s house, of “Henry the Fifth;” a most noble play, writ by my Lord Orrery

1664-08-13 13:41 I got Mr Creed to give me a play, lending him money to do it, a fallacy I have found to avoyde my vowe with but never to be more practised.

1664-08-13 06:56 The other Mr. Reeve gives me, and is of value; and a curious curiosity it is to look objects in a darke room with.

1664-08-13 06:54 For the first I did give him 5l. 10s, a great price, but a most curious bauble it is, and as good, nay, the best he knows in England.

1664-08-13 06:52 There comes also Mr. Reeve, with a microscope and scotoscope.

1664-08-13 06:20 Comes my Taylor with a coate to wear within doors, to come no lower than my knees, for by wearing a gowne comes my tenderness about my legs.

1664-08-12 22:15 Our poor Fancy, to my great grief, continues lame still so that I wish she had not been brought home again, for it troubles me to see her.

1664-08-12 21:44 Home. Though late, yet Pedro being there, he sang a song and parted. I did give him 5s but find it burdensome and will break up the meeting.

1664-08-12 10:51 Busy at the office with Sir W. Warren about a contract for New England masts, where I was very hard with him, even to the making him angry.

1664-08-11 22:10 I late to my office, and cannot forbear admiring and consulting my new rule, and so home to supper and to bed.

1664-08-11 19:15 For a wager before the King, my Lords of Castlehaven and Arran, they two alone did run down and kill a stoute bucke in St. James’s parke.

1664-08-11 16:27 Home, whither comes Cocker with my rule, which he hath engraved to admiration: it cost me 14s. the doing, and mightily pleased I am with it.

1664-08-11 13:51 Mr. Creed, lately come from the Downes, dined with me. I show him a good countenance, but love him not for his base ingratitude to me.

1664-08-11 09:47 A high dispute against Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen about the breadth of canvas again, they being for the making of it narrower.

1664-08-11 05:04 Up, and through pain, to my great grief forced to wear my gowne to keep my legs warm.

1664-08-10 10:28 Strange it is to see Cocker with his natural eyes to cut so small at his first designing it, and read it all over, without any missing.

1664-08-10 09:53 I find out Cocker, the famous writing-master, and get him to do it.

1664-08-10 09:10 Abroad to do several small businesses, among others to find out one to engrave my tables upon my new sliding rule with silver plates.

1664-08-09 18:30 The Emperour hath beat the Turke; killed the Grand Vizier and several great Bassas, with an army of 80,000 men killed and routed.

1664-08-09 16:04 To my office and my head being a little troubled with the little wine I drank, though mixed with beer, but it may be more than I used to do.

1664-08-09 14:57 Mr. Blagrave and I a little talke by ourselves of his kinswoman that is to come to live with my wife, who is to come about ten days hence.

1664-08-08 17:39 We saw “Flora’s Figarys.” By the most ingenuous performance of the young jade Flora, it seemed as pretty a pleasant play as ever I saw.

1664-08-08 15:10 My wife and I to the King’s play-house, she giving me her time of the last month, she having not seen any then; so my vowe is not broke.

1664-08-08 14:38 Home to dinner, and after dinner to hang up my fine pictures in my dining room, which makes it very pretty.

1664-08-07 17:21 I would to God they would either conform, or be more wise, and not be catched!

1664-08-07 17:20 Came by several poor creatures carried by by constables, for being at a conventicle. They go like lambs, without any resistance.

1664-08-07 17:10 Mr. Spong tell me that by his microscope he do discover that the wings of a moth is made just as the feathers of the wing of a bird.

1664-08-07 16:55 Mr. Spong talking of many ingenuous things, musique, and at last of glasses, and I find him still the same ingenuous man that ever he was.

1664-08-07 15:42 I met Mr. Blagrave, who gives a report of the boy, and I spoke to him, and he seems a willing boy to come to me, and I hope will do well.

1664-08-07 14:33 At home met with a letter of Captain Cooke’s, with which he had sent a boy for me to see, whom he did intend to recommend to me.

1664-08-07 11:47 I showed my wife, to her great joy, Mr. Gauden’s present of plate, the two flaggons, that I hardly can think that they are yet mine.

1664-08-07 09:10 My wife telling me sad stories of the ill, improvident, disquiett, and sluttish manner that my father and mother and Pall live.

1664-08-06 19:22 We ‘light in Holborne, and by another coach my wife and mayde home, and I by horseback, and found all things most mighty neate and clean.

1664-08-06 14:30 Here very merry as being weary I could be, and after dinner, out again, and to London.

1664-08-06 12:15 We mounted and away with them to Welling, and there ‘light, and dined very well and merry and glad to see my poor-wife.

1664-08-06 08:03 W. Joyce and I to a game at bowles on the green, and then comes my wife in the coach.

1664-08-06 01:15 W. Joyce comes into my chamber, with a note from my wife, that she was come by Yorke coach to Bigglesworth, and would be with us to-morrow.

1664-08-05 21:40 To my great trouble, find that my wife was not come, nor any Stamford coach gone down this week, so that she cannot come.

1664-08-05 21:10 To Barnett, and there drank, and so by night to Stevenage, it raining a little, but not much.

1664-08-05 12:10 W. Joyce and I out of towne toward Highgate. At Kentish-towne, showing me the place and manner of Clun’s being killed and laid in a ditch.

1664-08-05 10:38 And so through the City, not a little proud, God knows, to be seen upon so pretty a beast.

1664-08-05 10:10 I dressed myself, and so mounted upon a very pretty mare, sent me by Sir W. Warren, according to his promise yesterday.

1664-08-05 04:36 Up very betimes and set my plaisterer to work about whiting and colouring my musique roome.

1664-08-04 17:28 Clun, one of their best actors, was, the last night, going out of towne, set upon and murdered. It seems most cruelly butchered and bound.

1664-08-04 17:08 I was much pleased with the play, and it being given me, I look upon it as no breach to my oathe.

1664-08-04 17:06 Sir W. Penn did carry me to a play and pay for me at the King’s house, which is “The Rivall Ladys,” an innocent and most pretty witty play.

1664-08-04 13:37 Dined with Sir W. Pen, a piece of beef only, and I counterfeited a friendship and mirth which I cannot have with him.

1664-08-04 12:05 To the office, fitting myself against a great dispute about the East India Company, which spent afterwards with us all the morning.

1664-08-03 10:10 Mr Coventry and I discoursed of the likeliness of a Dutch warr which I think is likely. The Dutch do prepare a fleet to oppose us at Guinny.

1664-08-03 08:03 To Mr. Blagrave’s, and had his consent for his kinswoman to come to be with my wife for her woman, at which I am well pleased.

1664-08-03 05:58 Up betimes and set some joyners on work to new lay my floor in our wardrobe, which I intend to make a room for musique.

1664-08-02 20:55 To Sir W. Pen, and with him to Church to lay his brother in the ground, wherein nothing handsome at all.

1664-08-02 17:22 Four operas it shall have in the year; we shall have the best scenes and machines, and every thing as magnificent as is in Christendome.

1664-08-02 17:20 Tom Killigrew tells me that he is setting up a Nursery; that is, is going to build a house, wherein he will have common plays acted.

1664-08-02 17:04 To the King’s play-house, and there saw “Bartholomew Fayre,” which do still please me; and is, as it is acted, the best comedy in the world.

1664-08-02 14:42 Sir W. Warren told me that he confesses himself my debtor for my service and friendship to him in his present great contract of masts.

1664-08-01 14:22 Mrs. Harman is a very pretty-humoured wretch, whom I could love with all my heart, being so good and innocent company.

1664-08-01 14:10 Very merry we were, but Will most troublesomely so, and I find he and his wife have a most wretched life one with another.

1664-08-01 13:49 Taking up Harman and his wife, to Anthony Joyce’s, where we had my venison in a pasty well done; but, Lord! to see how much they made of it.

1664-08-01 10:15 All the Coffee-house full of the victory Generall Soushe hath had against the Turke; killing 4,000 men, and taking most extraordinary spoil.

1664-08-01 05:32 Up, my mind very light from my last night’s accounts.

1664-08-01 00:07 I was waked with knocking at Sir W. Pen’s door; and what was it but people’s running up and down to bring him word that his brother is dead.
