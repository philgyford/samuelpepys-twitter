1664-07-31 22:06   To bed, desiring God to give me the grace to make good use of what I have and continue my care and diligence to gain more.

1664-07-31 20:48   With great thanks to Almighty God, I do find myself most clearly worth 1014l., the first time that ever I was worth 1000l. before.

1664-07-31 17:32   After dinner Mr. Hill and I to my house, and there to musique all the afternoon.

1664-07-30 21:30   This day I sent a side of venison and six bottles of wine to Kate Joyce.

1664-07-30 17:16   I finished the contracts for victualling of Tangier, and to my comfort got Mr. Lanyon and Andrews to sign to the giving me 300l. per annum.

1664-07-30 12:20   Great talke of a rich present brought by an East India ship from the Princes of India, worth to the King 70,000l. in two precious stones.

1664-07-29 20:37   But I begin to be weary of having a master with us, for it spoils, methinks, the ingenuity of our practice.

1664-07-29 20:32   Came Mr. Hill, Andrews and Seignor Pedro, and great store of musique we had.

1664-07-29 16:31   I had my end to see what a cunning jade she was, to see her impudent tricks and ways of raising the reckoning by still calling for things.

1664-07-29 16:28   The jade, she would not offer to invite to do anything, but on the contrary saying she had no time, which I was glad of.

1664-07-29 16:26   It raining turned into Fleet Alley, and there was with Cocke an hour or so.

1664-07-28 20:21   I am endeavouring to find a woman for my wife to my mind, and above all one that understands musique, especially singing.

1664-07-28 20:18   My wife in the country and my mayde Besse with her. I do now live prettily at home, being neatly served by my two mayds Jane and Su.

1664-07-28 18:14   Strange to think how when I find that Jervas himself did intend to bring my periwigg, and not Jane his maid, I did desire not to have it.

1664-07-28 16:57   I saw “The Bondman” acted. For want of practice they had many of them forgot their parts; but Betterton and my Ianthe outdo all the world.

1664-07-28 14:04   Seeing “The Bondman” upon the posts, I consulted my oaths and find I may go safely this time without breaking it.

1664-07-27 16:18   Came my great store of Coles in, being 10 Chaldron, so that I may see how long they will last me.

1664-07-27 09:30   I went to Mr. Povy’s, and there heard a little of his empty discourse.

1664-07-26 17:04   I to Mr. Reeves to see a microscope, he having been with me to-day morning, and there chose one which I will have.

1664-07-26 15:15   Great discourse of the fray in Moorefields, how the butchers at first did beat the weavers, but at last the weavers rallied and beat them.

1664-07-26 14:22   Among them to lie with our heads where our heels do, or at least to make the bed high at feet and low at head.

1664-07-26 14:20   I began discourse of my not getting of children, and prayed them to give me their advice, and they freely and merrily did give me ten.

1664-07-26 13:49   Very merry we were, and when the women were merry and rose from table, I above with them, ne’er a man but I.

1664-07-26 12:05   To Anthony Joyce’s, to our gossip’s dinner. I had sent a dozen and a half of bottles of wine, and paid my double share besides, 18s.

1664-07-25 21:10   Strange to see how we are all divided that were bred so long at school together, and what various fortunes we have run, some good, some bad.

1664-07-25 20:49   With Mr. Cole, talking of old school stories, and truly I find that we did spend our time then otherwise than I think boys do now.

1664-07-25 19:15   Mr. Cole is giving over his trade; he will turn what he has into money and go to sea, his father being dead and leaving him little.

1664-07-25 16:29   To Mr. Reeves, but he was not within, so I walked all round that end of the town among the loathsome people and houses.

1664-07-25 15:48   To my barber Gervas, who this day buries his child, which it seems was born without a passage behind, so that it never voided any thing.

1664-07-25 14:10   I could not keep myself from Fleet Lane, but had the sense of honour not to go in, and I feared I might meet with people that know me.

1664-07-25 11:30   Sir W. Batten and I to the Coffee-house, but no newes, only the plague is very hot still, and encreases among the Dutch.

1664-07-25 09:10   To my Lord Berkeley’s, and met with the King’s commission for the repair of Paul’s, which is large, and large power for collecting money.

1664-07-24 19:07   In some pain all day from yesterday’s passages, having taken cold, I suppose.

1664-07-23 22:03   So to my office writing letters, and then home and to bed, weary of the pleasure I have had to-day, and ashamed to think of it.

1664-07-23 17:55   Desiring God to forgive me for this vanity, I went home, taking books from my bookseller, and paid 10l. for books I have laid up money for.

1664-07-23 17:03   The woman indeed is a most lovely woman, but I had no courage to meddle with her for fear of her not being wholesome.

1664-07-23 16:48   To Fleet Alley and went in and saw what I have been acquainted with the wickedness of these houses and the forcing a man to present expense.

1664-07-23 15:52   Mrs. Lane being the strangest woman in talk of love to her husband sometimes, and sometimes again she do not care for him.

1664-07-23 15:40   I met Mrs. Lane at White’s stairs, and over to the old house at Lambeth Marsh, and there eat and drank, and had my pleasure of her twice.

1664-07-23 14:32   By sense of honour and conscience I would not go in, but much against my will took coach and away, and away to Westminster Hall.

1664-07-23 14:20   Being in an idle and wanton humour I walked through Fleet Alley and there stood a pretty wench at one of the doors, so I took a turn or two.

1664-07-23 12:07   I took occasion to break the business of my Lord Chancellor’s timber to Mr. Coventry in the best manner I could.

1664-07-22 22:18   To supper and to the office a little, and to walk in the garden, the moon shining bright, and fine warm fair weather, and so home to bed.

1664-07-22 20:45   They spent the evening in singing the best piece of musique counted of all hands in the world, made by Seignor Charissimi.

1664-07-22 18:27   Home and find Mr. Hill, and Andrews, and one slovenly and ugly fellow, Seignor Pedro, who sings Italian songs to the theorbo most neatly.

1664-07-22 14:20   Putting Mr. Shish to measure timber, which he did most cruelly wrong, and to the King’s losse 12 or 13s. in a piece of 28 feet in contents.

1664-07-21 16:12   Mrs. Lane’s husband is a man of no discourse, and I fear married her to make a prize of, and a sad wife I believe she will prove to him.

1664-07-21 16:08   To Mrs. Lane, to give her joy, and there suffered me to deal with her as I hoped to do. By and by her husband comes, a sorry, simple fellow.

1664-07-21 14:44   To my Lord Chancellor, a good account of his business, and he is well pleased therewith, and carries himself with great discretion to me.

1664-07-21 10:04   Making a contract with Sir W. Warren for almost 1000 Gottenburg masts, the biggest that ever was made in the Navy, wholly of my compassing.

1664-07-20 21:50   This evening being moonshine I played a little late upon my flageolette in the garden.

1664-07-20 15:59   I met with great news that Mrs. Lane is married to one Martin. I must have a bout with her very shortly to see how she finds marriage.

1664-07-20 15:20   Good sport it was to see how most that did give their ten pounds did go away with a pair of globes only for their lot.

1664-07-20 14:55   I observed the King and Queenes did get but as poor lots as any else.

1664-07-20 14:40   One I staid to see drew a suit of hangings valued at 430l., and they say are well worth the money, or near it.

1664-07-20 14:15   To White Hall, to the Committee for Fishing; but nothing done, it being a great day upon drawing at the Lottery of Sir Arthur Slingsby.

1664-07-20 11:11   Home with Mr. Deane, discoursing upon the business of my Lord Chancellor’s timber, and how to make a report therein without offending him.

1664-07-20 00:26   They being gone, I to bed.

1664-07-20 00:24   At the office about Sir W. Warren’s contract for masts, and then at home with Lanyon and Yeabsly about their contract for Tangier.

1664-07-19 14:30   By water to Woolwich, where at the ropeyarde we are told that Mr. Falconer, who hath been ill of a relapse these two days, is just now dead.

1664-07-18 11:25   I did sport with my barber’s mayd Jane, without any knowledge of her though, and a very pretty innocent girl she is.

1664-07-18 11:10   To my barber’s, to have my Periwigg he lately made me cleansed of its nits, which vexed me that he should put such a thing into my hands.

1664-07-18 09:48   The Duke discourses very freely of a warr with Holland, to begin about winter, so that I believe we shall come to it.

1664-07-18 07:34   Up, and walked to my Lord’s, and there took my leave of him. He sets out this morning for Deale.

1664-07-17 20:20   Dr. Burnett showed me the manner of eating turpentine, which pleases me well, for it is with great ease.

1664-07-17 14:10   I got a piece of cake.

1664-07-17 13:49   I found my Lord and much other guests at table at dinner, and it seems they have christened his young son to-day – called him James.

1664-07-16 15:58   And by their promise I do thereby get 300l. per annum to myself, which do overjoy me; and the matter is left to me to draw up.

1664-07-16 15:50   To the Tangier Committee, and there, above my expectation, got the business of our contract for the victualling carried for my people.

1664-07-16 05:43   Up, my head mightily confounded with the great deale of business I have upon me to do.

1664-07-15 21:31   With my mind I bless God in good state of ease and body of health, only my head at this juncture full of business, how to get something.

1664-07-15 10:33   To White Hall; where there comes Mrs. Stewart, in a most lovely form, with her hair all about her eares, having her picture taking there.

1664-07-15 08:03   In the middle of our discourse my Lady Crew came in to bring my Lord word that he hath another son, my Lady being brought to bed just now.

1664-07-15 07:44   My Lord told me that his work is only to keep up his interest at Court, having little hope to get more. He hath now about 8,000l. per annum.

1664-07-15 07:29   I did give my Lord Sandwich an account of what had passed with my Lord Chancellor yesterday; with which he was well pleased.

1664-07-14 19:30   There has been so little ground for his jealousy of me, I am afeard that my Lord Chancellor do this to bring me to his side by scaring me.

1664-07-14 19:24   I think I did thoroughly appease my Lord Chancellor, till he thanked me for my desire and pains to satisfy him.

1664-07-14 19:22   My Lord Chancellor walked with me, I think, above an houre, talking most friendly, yet cunningly.

1664-07-14 13:34   He was confident upon my Lord Sandwich’s character of me, but he had reason to think what he did, and desired me to call upon him to-night.

1664-07-14 13:32   I to my Lord Chancellor’s; and I accosted him, telling him that I was the unhappy Pepys that had fallen into his high displeasure.

1664-07-14 07:44   All of which, I did assure my Lord, was most properly false, and nothing like it true; and told my Lord the whole passage.

1664-07-14 07:35   My Lord Chancellor said that I did most ungentlemanlike with him, and had justified rogues in cutting down a tree of his.

1664-07-14 07:34   In me, by a displeasure which my Lord Chancellor did show to him last night against me, in the most passionate manner any man did speak.

1664-07-14 07:32   My Lord Sandwich did begin with a profession of confidence in me, then told me what a misfortune was fallen upon me and him.

1664-07-14 06:03   Hearing a psalm sung, I went into St. Dunstan’s, and there heard prayers read, which, it seems, is done there every morning at six o’clock.

1664-07-13 12:50   I with Captain Ferrers to Mr. Barwell the King’s Squire Sadler, where about this time twelvemonths I dined before at a good venison pasty.

1664-07-13 12:03   I to my Lord Sandwich, thinking to have dined there, but they not dining at home.

1664-07-12 16:04   Mr Coventry and I to Blackwall and fine storehouses there are and good docks but of no great profit to him that oweth them for ought we see.

1664-07-12 13:30   Dined alone; sad for want of company and not being very well, and know not how to eat alone.

1664-07-12 00:13   At last Jane rose, and then I understand it was only the dogg wants a lodging and so made a noyse.

1664-07-11 23:58   These thoughts and fears I had, and do hence apprehend the fears of all rich men that are covetous and have much money by them.

1664-07-11 23:50   I rung, and could not make either of the wenches hear me, and this made me fear the more, lest they might be gag’d.

1664-07-11 23:23   Knowing what money I have in the house and hearing a noyse, I begun to sweat worse and worse, till I melted almost to water.

1664-07-11 23:14   I betimes to bed. And there fell into a most mighty sweat in the night.

1664-07-11 19:10   We rode home, round by Kingsland, Hackney, and Mile End till we were quite weary, and my water working at least 7 or 8 times upon the road.

1664-07-11 15:15   I and Will to see the Wells, half a mile off, and there I drank three glasses, and went and walked and came back and drunk two more.

1664-07-11 13:30   Here we staid two hours and then parted for all together, and my poor wife I shall soon want I am sure.

1664-07-11 11:03   By coach to Holborne, where they set out, and I and my man Will on horseback, by my wife, to Barnett; a very pleasant day.

1664-07-10 21:42   Home, and there my wife fell to putting things in order against her going to-morrow, and I to read, and so to bed, where I not well.

1664-07-10 13:20   By water to Somersett House, and walked to my Lord Sandwich’s, and there dined with my Lady and the children.

1664-07-09 22:10   To bed, where we have not lain together because of the heat of the weather a good while, but now against my wife going into the country.

1664-07-09 16:38   Home, by the way calling for my Chaucer and other books, and that is well done to my mind, which pleased me well.

1664-07-09 14:45   A great dispute we had; some, that we should swear to be true to the best of our power, and others to the best of our understanding.

1664-07-09 14:32   By coach with Sir J. Minnes to White Hall, and there to a Committee for Fishing; but the first thing was swearing to be true to the Company.

1664-07-08 18:38   To my office till 5 o’clock, and then came Mr. Hill and Andrews, and we sung an houre or two.

1664-07-08 11:20   To the binder’s and directed the doing of my Chaucer, though they were not neate enough; to the clasp-maker’s to have it clasped and bossed.

1664-07-08 08:11   I am concerned in hopes of the 50l. my Lord promised me, but I dare not reckon myself sure of it, for these Lords are hard to be trusted.

1664-07-07 22:07   Home and to bed, finding myself pretty well for all my waistecoate being put off to-day.

1664-07-07 17:19   I home, calling by the way for my new bookes, viz, Sir H. Spillman’s “Whole Glossary,” “Scapula’s Lexicon,” and Shakespeare’s plays.

1664-07-07 07:00   This day begun, the first day this year, to put off my linnen waistcoat, but it happening to be a cool day I was afraid of taking cold.

1664-07-06 21:15   The charge of the barge lies heavy upon me, which troubles me, but it is but once, and I may make Pierce do me some courtesy as great.

1664-07-06 20:59   Mrs. Clerke herself witty, but spoils all in making so great a flutter with a few fine clothes and some bad tawdry things worne with them.

1664-07-06 20:54   Mrs. Clerke’s kinswoman sings very prettily, but is very confident in it.

1664-07-06 20:50   Mrs. Pierce hath, I think, the best complexion that ever I saw on any woman, young or old, or child either, all days of my life.

1664-07-06 20:00   And so home to the Bridge, bringing night home with us.

1664-07-06 13:52   Come to the Hope and there showed them all the ships, and had a collacion of anchovies, gammon, &c.

1664-07-06 08:13   Mr Pierce and his wife, and a kinswoman and his sister, and Mrs Clerke and her sister and cozen were to expect us; so set out for the Hope.

1664-07-06 08:04   Having got some bottles of wine and beer and neat’s tongues, we went to our barge at the Towre.

1664-07-05 21:21   Full of thoughts of a sudden resolution this day taken upon the ’Change of going down to-morrow to the Hope.

1664-07-05 15:37   Much discourse with young Gregory about the Chest business, wherein Sir W. Batten is so great a knave.

1664-07-05 06:27   Went to bed discontented, and my wife came to bed to me, but all would not make me friends, but sleep and rise in the morning angry.

1664-07-04 19:04   The King and the Queene went to visit my Lord Sandwich and the fleete, going forth in the Hope.

1664-07-04 14:51   I followed Besse my wife’s messenger at the ‘Change, and sent her back; I would not have the pendantes changed, satisfied that she yielded.

1664-07-04 14:04   I vowed to breake the pendantes, or that she should go and get what she could for them again.

1664-07-04 13:57   It brought both me and my wife to very high and very foule words from her to me, such as trouble me to think she should have in her mouth.

1664-07-04 13:49   At home find my wife this day of her owne accord to have lain out 25s. upon a pair of pendantes for her eares, which did vex me.

1664-07-03 20:41   It thundering and lightning all the evening, and this yeare have had the most of thunder and lightning they say of any in man’s memory.

1664-07-03 13:20   To dinner, where the remains of yesterday’s venison and a couple of brave green geese, which we are fain to eat alone.

1664-07-02 14:59   After dinner sat close to discourse about our business of the victualling of the garrison of Tangier.

1664-07-02 12:50   To the ’Change, and there I could meet with nobody that I could invite home to my venison pasty, but only Mr. Alsopp and Mr. Lanyon.

1664-07-01 21:10   We broke up with great pleasure, and very good company it is, and I hope I shall now and then have their company.

1664-07-01 19:04   By agreement came Mr. Hill and Andrews and one Cheswicke, a maister who plays very well upon the Spinette, and we sat singing Psalms.

1664-07-01 12:12   Dr. Burnett did write me down some direction what to do for it, but not with the satisfaction I expected.

1664-07-01 12:10   Dr. Burnett assures me that I have an ulcer either in the kidneys or bladder, for my water, he is sure the sediment is a direct pusse.

1664-07-01 11:45   Within all the morning, first bringing down my Tryangle to my chamber below, having a new frame made proper for it to stand on.
