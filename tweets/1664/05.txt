1664-05-31 21:45   The discourse of the town is only whether a warr with Holland or no, and we are preparing for it all we can, which is but little.

1664-05-31 21:35   Upon Sunday night last, being the King’s birth-day, the King was at my Lady Castlemayne’s lodgings, dancing with fiddlers all night almost.

1664-05-31 21:22   To my monthly accounts, where to my great comfort I find myself better than I was still the last month, and now come to 930l.

1664-05-31 10:05   I think if I do find it fit to keep a boy at all I had as good be supplied from Captain Cooke with one as any body.

1664-05-31 08:41   I called upon Mr. Hollyard. I shall fall upon some course of doing something for my disease of the wind, which grows upon me every day.

1664-05-30 20:58   Came Mr. Howe and sat and then supped with me. He is a little conceited, but will make a discreet man.

1664-05-30 19:51   All the day long in my study at home studying of shipmaking with great content till the evening.

1664-05-29 21:44   It is a most strange thing that in such warm weather the least ayre should get cold and wind in me.

1664-05-29 14:50   Up and down to see Mr. Povy’s house. And in a word, methinks it do surpass all that ever I did see of one man in all my life.

1664-05-29 10:35   Mr. Coventry and I did discourse of the warr with the Dutch; and he seemed to argue with the little reason that there is for all this.

1664-05-28 21:58   But, Lord! to see how my very going to the ‘Change, and being without my gowne, presently brought me wind and pain.

1664-05-28 17:32   Home, and at the office a while, and then with Mr. Deane to a second lesson upon my Shipwrightry, wherein I go on with great pleasure.

1664-05-28 14:04   A good dinner. Good discourse, Sir W. Rider especially much fearing the issue of a Dutch warr, wherein I very highly commend him.

1664-05-28 11:45   Up pretty well as to pain and wind, and to the office, where we sat close and did much business.

1664-05-27 14:48   With Mr. Wayth to St. Catherine’s to see some variety of canvas’s, which indeed was worth my seeing.

1664-05-27 11:32   To the office, where busy till my brains ready to drop with variety of business. Vexed to see the service suffer by other people’s neglect.

1664-05-27 09:11   I am afeard she will be over high for us, she having last been a chamber mayde, and holds up her head, as my little girle Su observed.

1664-05-27 09:09   My taylor brought me a mayde to be my cook-mayde; she asked 5l, but my wife offered but 3l 10s — whether she will take it or no I know not.

1664-05-26 16:04   Lord! what a pitiful rout of people there was of them, but very good service and great company the whole was.

1664-05-26 16:01   To the Old Bayly, and there we were led to the Quest House, where all the kindred were by themselves at the buriall of my uncle Fenner.

1664-05-26 10:42   I had some high words with Sir W. Batten about canvas, wherein I opposed him and all his experience, to the rejecting of the whole business.

1664-05-25 16:48   In my chamber spending two or three hours to look over some unpleasant letters and things of trouble to answer my father in.

1664-05-24 20:20   This day I heard that my uncle Fenner is dead, which makes me a little sad, to see with what speed a great many of my friends are gone.

1664-05-23 21:18   At the office late discoursing with Sir J. Minnes and Sir W. Batten, who like a couple of sots receive all I say but to little purpose.

1664-05-23 15:52   I did at Mr. Ackworth’s obtain a demonstration of his being a knave; but I did not discover it, till it be a little more seasonable.

1664-05-23 13:28   To Mr. Falconer’s to a good dinner, having myself carried them a vessel of sturgeon and a Lamprey pie.

1664-05-23 11:04   The King is gone down with the Duke and a great crew this morning by break of day to Chatham.

1664-05-22 22:11   I wrote a letter to Mr. Coventry, and so a good supper of pease, the first I eat this year, and so to bed.

1664-05-22 16:27   With Mr. Wayth talking about his supplying us with canvas, and he told me in discourse several instances of Sir W. Batten’s cheats.

1664-05-22 15:33   I walked to the Docke, where I met Mrs. Ackworth alone at home, and God forgive me! what thoughts I had, but I had not the courage to stay.

1664-05-21 16:20   Called to see my Lady Sandwich, whom we found in her dining-room, which joyed us mightily; but she looks very thin, being mightily broke.

1664-05-21 15:48   Abroad with my wife by coach to the New Exchange, and there laid out almost 40s. upon her.

1664-05-21 09:02   To another Committee of Tangier, as we did meet as we did use to do, to see more of Povy’s folly.

1664-05-20 20:10   With great trouble, it growing night, spent some time walking, and putting care out of my head, with my wife in the garden.

1664-05-20 16:21   Came a letter from my father so full of trouble for discontents between my mother and servants that I know not what in the world to do.

1664-05-20 09:32   By and by comes Povy, Creed, and Vernatty, and so to their accounts, wherein more trouble and vexation with Povy.

1664-05-19 22:12   So home to supper and to bed, finding myself pretty well. A pretty good stool, which I impute to my whey to-day, and broke wind also.

1664-05-19 21:04   All the afternoon till 9 at night, being fallen again to business, and I hope my health will give me leave to follow it.

1664-05-19 10:42   God forgive how our Report of my Lord Peterborough’s accounts was agreed to by the Lords, without one of them understanding it!

1664-05-18 21:54   So to bed, afraid that I have been too bold to-day in venturing in the cold.

1664-05-18 19:22   I met a pretty cabinet sent me by Mr. Shales, which I give my wife, the first I ever had yet, and conveniently it comes for her closett.

1664-05-17 22:03   To bed, and endeavoured to tie my hands that I might not lay them out of bed, by which I believe I have got cold, but I could not endure it.

1664-05-17 15:08   To the office, finding myself better than I was, and making a little water, but not yet breaking any great store of wind, which I wonder at.

1664-05-16 17:48   My pain grew so great, besides a bruise I got in my right testicle, which now vexes me as much as the other, that I was mighty melancholy.

1664-05-16 15:10   I walked to Westminster Hall, where the King was expected to come to prorogue the House, but it seems, afterwards I hear, he did not come.

1664-05-16 12:35   With the little they got in, the dogg did presently fall asleep, and so lay till we cut him up. It is a strange and sudden effect.

1664-05-16 12:15   Mr. Pierce and Dr. Clerke did fail mightily in hitting the vein, and in effect did not do the business after many trials.

1664-05-16 11:55   We to see an experiment of killing a dogg by letting opium into his hind leg.

1664-05-16 10:20   To Mr. Pierce’s the chyrurgeon. His wife holds her complexion still, but she continues the veriest slattern that ever I knew in my life.

1664-05-15 11:15   I was not well, for I could make no water yet, but a drop or two with great pain, nor break any wind.

1664-05-15 06:37   Rose, and as I had intended without reference to this pain, took physique, and it wrought well with me.

1664-05-14 17:10   Upon getting by chance, among my other tumblings, upon my knees, in bed, my pain began to grow less and less.

1664-05-14 15:38   No wind could I break. I took a glyster, but it brought away but a little, and my height of pain followed it.

1664-05-14 14:48   My pain rose to be as great for an hour or two as ever I remember it was in any fit of the stone.

1664-05-14 04:32   Up, full of pain, I believe by cold got yesterday.

1664-05-13 11:28   In the Painted Chamber I heard a fine conference between some of the two Houses upon the Bill for Conventicles.

1664-05-13 07:09   To Woolwich, where I with Mr. Deane spent two hours upon the new ship, informing myself in the names and natures of many parts of her.

1664-05-13 04:32   A rainbow appeared, the first that ever in a morning I saw, and then it fell a-raining a little, but held up again.

1664-05-13 03:59   Up before three o’clock, and a little after upon the water, it being very light as at noon, and a bright sunrising.

1664-05-12 16:42   By a letter to me from Mr. Coventry I saw the first appearance of a warr with Holland.

1664-05-11 17:32   At my office to see it finished by the joyners and every thing in order, and indeed now my closet is very convenient and pleasant for me.

1664-05-11 14:26   Since my uncle Wight saw what my wife’s mind was he would say no more to her of it, and desired her to make no words of it.

1664-05-11 14:22   He thought it would be best for him and her to have a child between them. He would give her 500l. beforehand, and make the child his heir.

1664-05-11 14:20   My wife did tell me that my uncle Wight should begin discourse of her want of children and his also.

1664-05-10 12:06   Up and at my office looking after my workmen all the morning.

1664-05-09 19:10   We to Mr Hollyard to advise upon my wife drying up her issue in her leg, which inclines to dry up, and he admits that it should be dried up.

1664-05-09 15:30   My Lady Sandwich is as well as ever she was, as to the meazles, and nothing can I see upon her face.

1664-05-09 15:02   To my Lady Sandwich who, good lady, is now, thanks be to God! so well as to sit up and sent to us, if we were not afeard, to come up to her.

1664-05-08 17:04   To Sir W. Pen, and the perfidious rogue seems, as he do always, mightily civil to us, though I know he hates and envies us.

1664-05-08 13:32   Strange how Deane cries up chymistry from some talk with an acquaintance of his, when, poor man, he understands not one word of it.

1664-05-08 12:18   Deane and I to my chamber, and there we repeated my yesterday’s lesson about ships all the morning, and I hope I shall soon understand it.

1664-05-08 09:06   My new tailor, Mr. Langford, brought me home a new black cloth suit and cloake lined with silk moyre.

1664-05-07 17:38   Deane of Woolwich gives me instructions to understand the building of a ship, and I think I shall soon understand it.

1664-05-06 10:40   Sympson my joyner came to work upon altering my closet, which I alter by setting the door in another place, and several other things.

1664-05-05 18:10   To the office, where all the afternoon, and thence home, my eyes beginning to grow less and less able to bear with long reading or writing.

1664-05-04 21:44   To my office, where very late, till my eyes (which begin to fail me nowadays by candlelight) begin to trouble me.

1664-05-04 11:20   To the ‘Change a while. News uncertain how the Dutch proceed. Some say for, some against a war. The plague increases at Amsterdam.

1664-05-04 08:15   Up, and my new Taylor, Langford, comes and takes measure of me for a new black cloth suit and cloake I think he will please me well.

1664-05-03 22:15   I went with Mr. Norbury near hand to the Fleece, a mum house in Leadenhall, and there drunk mum.

1664-05-03 09:16   For all Mr. Povy’s folly he hath the lucke, now and then, to speak in as good words as if it were reason, one of the wonders of my life.

1664-05-03 09:10   Of all the men in the world, I never knew any man of Mr. Povy’s degree so great a coxcomb in such imployments.

1664-05-03 09:05   To Mr. Coventry’s chamber, and there upon my Lord Peterborough’s accounts, where I endeavoured to shew the folly of Mr. Povy.

1664-05-03 07:49   By agreement to Mr. Bland’s and there drank my morning draft in good chocollatte, and slabbering my band sent home for another.

1664-05-02 20:04   My wife would fain have kept the pieces of gold to look on, without any other design but a simple love to them; I thought it not convenient.

1664-05-02 19:55   Mr. Bland pays me the debt he owed me for my service in his business of the Tangier Merchant, twenty pieces of new gold, a pleasant sight.

1664-05-02 18:20   In the coach to the Parke, where no pleasure; there being much dust, little company, and one of our horses almost spoiled by falling down.

1664-05-02 17:27   There being nothing in the play but the odd accidents that fell out, by a lady’s being bred up in man’s apparel, and a man in a woman’s.

1664-05-02 17:25   To the King’s Play-house, my wife and I, and there saw “The Labyrinth,” the poorest play, methinks, that ever I saw.

1664-05-02 13:10   I walked to my Lord’s to hear how my Lady do, who is pretty well; at least past all fear.

1664-05-01 15:15   By water with my wife and Besse with pleasure as low as Greenwich and so back, playing as it were leisurely upon the water to Deptford.

1664-05-01 10:44   Went not to church, but staid at home to examine my last night’s accounts, which I find right, and that I am 908l. creditor in the world.
