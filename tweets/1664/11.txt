1664-11-30 22:02   So, with my heart glad to see my accounts fall so right in this time of mixing of monies and confusion, I home to bed.

1664-11-30 21:53   I to my monthly accounts and, bless God! I find I have increased my last balance. Praise God for what I have which is 1209l.

1664-11-29 10:03   Sir G. Carteret told us how the King inclines to our request of making us Commissioners of the Prize office.

1664-11-28 14:48   Home to dinner, then come Dr. Clerke to speak with me about sick and wounded men, wherein he is like to be concerned.

1664-11-28 10:40   The Dutch have sent part of their fleete round by Scotland; and pay the rest half-pay, promising the rest in the Spring, keeping their men.

1664-11-27 21:20   After supper fell into the rarest discourse with Mr. Hill about Rome and Italy; but most pleasant that I ever had in my life.

1664-11-27 20:06   Come Mr. Andrews and Hill, and we sung, with my boy, Ravenscroft’s 4-part psalms, most admirable musique.

1664-11-27 17:22   Setting right my business of flaggs. After all my pains find reason not to be sorry, because I think it will bring me considerable profit.

1664-11-26 22:20   To the office, where very late busy till quite weary, but contented well with my dispatch of business.

1664-11-25 21:15   The House have given the King 2,500,000l. to be paid for this warr, only for the Navy, in three years’ time; which is a joyfull thing.

1664-11-25 20:06   I hear that Mrs. Lane and her husband live a sad life, and he is gone to be a paymaster to a company to Portsmouth. She big with child.

1664-11-25 11:59   But God knows this is only a scare to the Parliament, to make them give the more money.

1664-11-25 11:57   At my office, to prepare an account of the charge we have been put to by the Dutch already; and I have brought it to appear 852,700l.

1664-11-24 14:22   Fine discourse we had and fine talke, being proud to see myself accepted in such company and thought better than I am.

1664-11-24 14:20   I dined with Sir Philip Warwicke, and Mr. Povy with us and Sir Edmund Pooly, a fine gentleman, and Mr. Chichly.

1664-11-24 12:48   Out with Commissioner Pett, and he and I to a Coffee-house, to drink jocolatte, very good.

1664-11-24 12:05   Up and to the office, where all the morning busy answering of people.

1664-11-23 19:05   Mr. Hollyard came to me and told me that he hath searched my boy and he finds he hath a stone in his bladder, which grieves me to the heart.

1664-11-23 15:30   Sir G. Carteret was here; strange to see how we plot to make the charge of this warr to appear greater than it is, because of getting money.

1664-11-22 21:44   Troubled to hear my poor boy Tom has a fit of the stone, or some other pain like it. I must consult Mr. Holliard for him.

1664-11-22 19:10   Sir Richard Ford did meet us with letters from Holland this day, that it is likely the Dutch fleete will not come out this year.

1664-11-22 15:20   Sir Philip Warwicke told me that one year of the late Dutch warr cost 1,623,000l.

1664-11-21 21:55   I to White Hall to the Secretaries, and there wrote to Mr. Coventry, and so home by coach, a fine clear moonshine night, but very cold.

1664-11-21 20:20   Sir J. Minnes’s paper served us in no stead, but was all false, and after I had done it, I am confident he understands not one word in it.

1664-11-21 15:24   I had letters that three are brought into the Downes and Dover; so that the warr is begun: God give a good end to it!

1664-11-21 15:22   Newes is come that Teddiman hath brought in twenty Dutchmen, merchants, their Bourdeaux fleete, and two men of warr to Portsmouth.

1664-11-20 21:27   I was in the right, and was the willinger to do so before Sir W. Batten and my Lady, that they might see that I am somebody.

1664-11-20 21:25   I did roundly and in many words for an houre together talk boldly to Sir J. Minnes, which pleased Sir W. Batten and my Lady.

1664-11-20 20:38   Sir J. Minnes’ folly so great in a report so ridiculous that he hath drawn up, nothing of it being true, that I was ashamed.

1664-11-20 09:20   Up, and with my wife to church, where Pegg Pen very fine in her new coloured silk suit laced with silver lace.

1664-11-19 15:15   Without dinner down by galley up and down the river to visit the yards and ships now ordered forth with great delight.

1664-11-18 09:45   To the Committee of the Fishery at White Hall, where so poor simple doings about the business of the Lottery, that I was ashamed to see it.

1664-11-17 14:22   But, which is a strange thing, my girle Susan could carry the chest alone, when neither I nor anyone but Jane the cook-mayde could do it.

1664-11-17 14:20   I received from Mr Foley, but for me to pay for it, if I like it, an iron chest, having now received back money I had laid out for the King.

1664-11-16 15:10   Much discourse with Sir W. Batten, how to get ourselves into some fair way of obliging the King to consider us in our extraordinary pains.

1664-11-16 04:33   My wife waked in the night, and strange to see how dead sleep our people sleep that she was fain to ring an hour before any body would wake.

1664-11-15 23:52   Late, very late, at business, nobody minding it but myself, and so home to bed, weary and full of thoughts.

1664-11-15 17:40   I took coach and to White Hall to a Committee of Tangier, where, and every where else, I thank God, I find myself growing in repute.

1664-11-15 16:27   But at last after many protestings by degrees I did arrive at what I would, with great pleasure.

1664-11-15 16:12   Many hard looks and sithes the poor wretch did give me, and I think verily was troubled at what I did.

1664-11-15 15:57   Bagwell’s wife with much ado followed me through Moorfields to a blind alehouse, and there I did caress her and eat and drink.

1664-11-15 06:40   That I might not be too fine for the business I intend this day, I did leave off my fine new cloth suit and put on my poor black suit.

1664-11-15 00:28   So home, where infinite busy till 12 at night, and so home to supper and to bed.

1664-11-14 18:15   The Dutch have stopped a ship of masts, coming in a Swede’s ship, which they will not release: which appears as the first act of hostility.

1664-11-14 16:29   To White Hall, to the Duke of Albemarle, about Tangier; and then homeward to the Coffee-house to hear newes.

1664-11-14 14:32   To the ‘Change, where mighty busy; and so home to dinner, where Mr. Creed and Moore: and after dinner I to my Lord Treasurer’s.

1664-11-14 09:30   To Sir Philip Warwicke about Navy business: and my Lord Ashly; and afterwards to my Lord Chancellor, who is very well pleased with me.

1664-11-14 08:10   Up, and with Sir W. Batten to White Hall, to the Lords of the Admiralty, and there did our business betimes.

1664-11-13 20:55   To sing psalms, and in come Mr. Hill to see me, and then he and I and the boy finely to sing, and so anon broke up after much pleasure.

1664-11-13 17:08   Spent all the afternoon with my wife within doors, and getting a speech out of Hamlett, “To bee or not to bee,” without book.

1664-11-13 09:10   To church, where mighty sport, to hear our clerke sing out of tune, though his master sits by him that keeps the tune aloud for the parish.

1664-11-12 22:28   To the office, where mighty busy till very late, but I bless God I go through with it very well and hope I shall.

1664-11-11 10:54   It was alive 24 hours, and cried and did as all hopefull children do; but, being showed too much to people, was killed.

1664-11-11 10:53   Two women children perfectly made, joyned at the lower part of their bellies, only one payre of legs coming forth where they were joined.

1664-11-11 10:52   A gentleman told us he saw the other day of a monster born of an hostler’s wife at Salisbury.

1664-11-11 09:52   I found my Lord Sandwich, his title under his armes is, “The most noble and mighty Lord, Edward, Earl of Sandwich, &c.”

1664-11-11 09:45   Looking upon books of heraldry of Sir Edward Walker’s making, which are very fine, I observed the Duke of Monmouth’s armes are neatly done.

1664-11-10 21:00   My little girle Susan is fallen sicke of the meazles, we fear, or, at least, of a scarlett feavour.

1664-11-10 17:15   So abroad, intending to have spoke with my Lord Chancellor about the old business of his wood at Clarendon, but could not, and so home.

1664-11-10 15:30   To the office, where Sir W. Batten begins, too fast, to shew his knavish tricks in giving what price he pleases for commodities.

1664-11-10 06:04   Up, and not finding my things ready, I was so angry with Besse, for though she be good-natured, she hath no care of her business at all.

1664-11-09 15:15   I am not a little contented at this chance of being made known to these persons, and called often by my name by the King.

1664-11-09 15:06   To White Hall. The King being in his Cabinet Council I was demanded by the King himself many questions to which I did give him full answers.

1664-11-09 11:37   Not staying, the wind blowing hard, I made use of the Jemmy yacht and returned to the Tower, my boy being a very droll boy and good company.

1664-11-09 08:03   Found the Charles. I up and down to see the ship I was so well acquainted with, and a great worke it is, the setting so great a mast.

1664-11-09 02:30   Called up, as I had appointed, I and my boy Tom by water with a gally down to the Hope, it being a fine starry night.

1664-11-08 22:05   All the afternoon at my office till late, and then to bed, joyed in my love and ability to follow my business.

1664-11-08 14:58   To the King, and went up and down the store-houses and magazines; which are, with the addition of the new great store-house, a noble sight.

1664-11-08 14:10   To dinner, to the Lieutenant’s of the Tower; where a good dinner, but disturbed in the middle of it by the King’s coming into the Tower.

1664-11-08 12:55   I and Sir J. Minnes and Lord Barkeley to the office of the Ordnance, to discourse about wadding for guns.

1664-11-08 09:40   Mr. Coventry come, and after doing a little business, took his leave of us, being to go to sea with the Duke to-morrow.

1664-11-07 16:40   I to my barber’s again, and did meet in the street my Jane, but could not talk with her, but only a word or two.

1664-11-07 13:20   I find that I dine as well myself, that is, as neatly, and my meat as good and well-dressed, as my good Lady do, in the absence of my Lord.

1664-11-07 11:55   I see the greatest businesses are done so superficially that I wonder anything succeeds at all among us, that is publique.

1664-11-07 11:33   A meeting of the Fishery but things looked so superficially over that I had not an opportunity to propose my paper that I wrote yesterday.

1664-11-07 09:10   With Sir W. Batten to White Hall, where mighty thrusting about the Duke now upon his going. We were with him long.

1664-11-06 16:38   Drawing up proposals to present to the Committee for the Fishery to-morrow, having a great good intention to be serviceable in the business.

1664-11-05 17:57   Home; the coach being forced to go round by London Wall home, because of the bonefires; the day being mightily observed in the City.

1664-11-05 17:06   With my wife to the Duke’s house to a play, “Macbeth,” a pretty good play, but admirably acted.

1664-11-04 15:05   I to the alehouse with a smith and was near buying 4 or 5 anchors, and learned something worth my knowing of them.

1664-11-04 09:51   Mr Coventry said Sir J Minnes was like a lapwing; that all he did was to keepe a flutter to keepe others from the nest that they would find.

1664-11-04 09:40   Mr. Coventry and I in the Long Gallery, talking about the management of our office; he tells me the weight of dispatch will lie on me.

1664-11-04 06:08   Waked very betimes and lay long awake, my mind being so full of business.

1664-11-03 21:58   Sir W. Batten did tell me that my Lord Sandwich will be sent Governor to Tangier. I think his honour will suffer, and his interest fail.

1664-11-03 21:33   Sir W. Pen came to take his leave of me, being to-morrow, which is very sudden to us, to go on board to lie on board.

1664-11-03 13:21   Very modestly she denied me, which I was glad to see and shall value her the better for it, and I hope never tempt her to any evil more.

1664-11-03 13:20   I did caress Bagwell’s wife, but though I did make some offer did not receive any compliance from her in what was bad.

1664-11-03 12:45   By appointment was met with Bagwell’s wife, and she followed me into Moorfields, and into a drinking house, and all alone eat and drank.

1664-11-03 11:11   At the office did much business, among other an end of that that has troubled me long, the business of the bewpers and flags.

1664-11-03 08:04   Up and to the office, where strange to see how Sir W. Pen is flocked to by people of all sorts against his going to sea.

1664-11-02 17:45   To my office all the afternoon, where in some pain in my backe, which troubled me, but I think it comes only with stooping.

1664-11-02 08:55   Back again home, I seeming very friendly to Mr. Castle, though I know him to be a rogue, and one that hates me with his heart.

1664-11-02 07:22   Up betimes, and down with Mr Castle to Redriffe, and there walked to Deptford to view a parcel of brave knees of his, which indeed are good.

1664-11-01 18:34   With Mr. Parham to the tavern, but I drank no wine, only he did give me another barrel of oysters, and good discourse to my information.

1664-11-01 16:20   To the Committee of the Fishery, and there we sat with several good discourses and some bad and simple ones, and with great disorder.

1664-11-01 12:40   My wife being invited to my Lady Sandwich’s, all alone dined at home upon a good goose with Mr. Wayth, discussing of business.

1664-11-01 01:02   Making up my month’s accounts, and find that my expense this month in clothes has kept me from laying up anything; but I am no worse.
