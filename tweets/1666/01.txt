1666-01-04 20:38 To my Lord Bruncker’s, thinking to have been merry, having appointed a meeting for Sir J. Minnes and his company and Mrs. Knipp again, but whatever hindered I know not, but no company come, which vexed me because it disappointed me of the glut of mirth I hoped for.

1666-01-04 14:58 Mr. Sheldon anon took leave and took Mrs. Barbary his niece home with him, and seems very thankful to me for the 10l. I did give him for my wife’s rent of his house, and I am sure I am beholding to him, for it was a great convenience to me.

1666-01-04 13:44 Home to dinner, where Mr. Sheldon come by invitation from Woolwich, and as merry as I could be with all my thoughts about me and my wife still in pain of her tooth.

1666-01-03 20:50 Then to dancing and supper, and mighty merry till Mr. Rolt come in, whose pain of the tooth-ake made him no company, and spoilt ours; so he away, and then my wife’s teeth fell of akeing, and she to bed.

1666-01-03 19:12 Home, and find all my good company I had bespoke, as Coleman and his wife, and Laneare, Knipp and her surly husband; and good music we had, and, among other things, Mrs. Coleman sang my words I set of “Beauty retire,” and I think it is a good song, and they praise it mightily.

1666-01-03 16:32 At the Duke of Albemarle’s with great joy I received the good news of the decrease of the plague this week to 70, and but 253 in all; which is the least Bill hath been known these twenty years in the City.

1666-01-03 15:10 All the morning till three in the afternoon examining and fitting up my Pursers’ paper and sent it away by an Express.

1666-01-02 23:20 Home to my lodgings and there endeavoured to have finished the examining my papers of Pursers’ business to have sent away to-night, but I was so sleepy with my late early risings and late goings to bed that I could not do it, but was forced to go to bed.

1666-01-02 22:10 I got into the coach where Mrs. Knipp was and got her upon my knee (the coach being full) and played with her breasts and sung, and at last set her at her house and so good night.

1666-01-02 18:10 To make our mirth the completer, Sir J. Minnes was in the highest pitch of mirth, and his mimicall tricks, that ever I saw, and most excellent pleasant company he is, and the best mimique that ever I saw, and certainly would have made an excellent actor.

1666-01-02 15:28 To my Lord Bruncker’s, and there find Sir J. Minnes and all his company, and Mr. Boreman and Mrs. Turner, but, above all, my dear Mrs. Knipp, with whom I sang, and in perfect pleasure I was to hear her sing, and especially her little Scotch song of “Barbary Allen”.

1666-01-02 05:45 Up by candlelight again, and wrote the greatest part of my business fair, and then to the office.

1666-01-01 18:04 Interrupted by Sir W. Warren’s coming, of whom I always learn something or other, his discourse being very good and his brains also.

1666-01-01 05:22 Called up by five o’clock, by my order, by Mr. Tooker, who wrote, while I dictated to him, my business of the Pursers.
