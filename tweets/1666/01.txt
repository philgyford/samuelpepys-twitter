1666-01-02 23:20 Home to my lodgings and there endeavoured to have finished the examining my papers of Pursers’ business to have sent away to-night, but I was so sleepy with my late early risings and late goings to bed that I could not do it, but was forced to go to bed.

1666-01-02 22:10 I got into the coach where Mrs. Knipp was and got her upon my knee (the coach being full) and played with her breasts and sung, and at last set her at her house and so good night.

1666-01-02 18:10 To make our mirth the completer, Sir J. Minnes was in the highest pitch of mirth, and his mimicall tricks, that ever I saw, and most excellent pleasant company he is, and the best mimique that ever I saw, and certainly would have made an excellent actor.

1666-01-02 15:28 To my Lord Bruncker’s, and there find Sir J. Minnes and all his company, and Mr. Boreman and Mrs. Turner, but, above all, my dear Mrs. Knipp, with whom I sang, and in perfect pleasure I was to hear her sing, and especially her little Scotch song of “Barbary Allen”.

1666-01-02 05:45 Up by candlelight again, and wrote the greatest part of my business fair, and then to the office.

1666-01-01 18:04 Interrupted by Sir W. Warren’s coming, of whom I always learn something or other, his discourse being very good and his brains also.

1666-01-01 05:22 Called up by five o’clock, by my order, by Mr. Tooker, who wrote, while I dictated to him, my business of the Pursers.
