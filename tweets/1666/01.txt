1666-01-16 21:45 Mightily troubled at the news of the plague’s being encreased, and was much the saddest news that the plague hath brought me; because of the lateness of the year, and the fear of its continuing with us the next summer. The total being now 375, and the plague 158.

1666-01-16 11:57 I to London to the office, and there forgot, through business, to bespeak any dinner for my wife and Mrs. Pierce.

1666-01-15 22:20 Pierce and I to bed together, and he and I very merry to find how little and thin clothes they give us to cover us, so that we were fain to lie in our stockings and drawers, and lay all our coats and clothes upon the bed.

1666-01-15 20:07 By and by we all to supper, which the silly master of the feast commended, but, what with my being out of humour, and the badness of the meat dressed, I did never eat a worse supper in my life.

1666-01-15 18:40 Not so much as her husband could get her to come; but, which was a pleasant thing in all my anger, I asking him what he thought, whether she would come or no, he answered that, for his part, he could not so much as think.

1666-01-15 18:32 To Boreman’s, where the greatest disappointment that ever I saw in my life, much company, and all come with expectation of excess of mirth, but all blank through the waywardnesse of Mrs. Knipp, who, though she had appointed the night, could not be got to come.

1666-01-14 19:20 The fair creature went away, and proves one of the modestest women, and pretty, that ever I saw in my life, and my wife judges her so too.

1666-01-14 17:03 After sermon, comes my dear fair beauty of the Exchange, Mrs. Batelier, brought by her sister, an acquaintance of Mercer’s, to see my wife. I saluted her with as much pleasure as I had done any a great while.

1666-01-14 16:10 I propose Mr. Harman the upholster for a husband for Pall, to whom I have a great love and did heretofore love his former wife, and a civil man he is and careful in his way.

1666-01-14 10:55 I perform my vow to finish my journall and other things before I kiss any woman more or drink any wine, which I must be forced to do to-morrow if I go to Greenwich as I am invited by Mr. Boreman to hear Mrs. Knipp sing, and I would be glad to go, so as we may be merry.

1666-01-14 09:04 Long in bed, till raised by my new taylor, Mr. Penny, who comes and brings me my new velvet coat, very handsome, but plain, and a day hence will bring me my camelott cloak.

1666-01-13 21:50 I trust in God if I can but clear myself of my Lord Sandwich’s bond, wherein I am bound with him for 1000l. to T. Pepys, I shall do pretty well, come what will come.

1666-01-13 13:45 With my Lord Bruncker to Mrs. Williams’s, in Covent-Garden, to dinner (the first time I ever was there), and there met Captain Cocke; and pretty merry, though not perfectly so, because of the fear that there is of a great encrease again of the plague this week.

1666-01-12 21:38 I to the office and thence home to my poor wife, who works all day at home like a horse, at the making of her hangings for our chamber and the bed.

1666-01-12 10:40 Called at Wotton’s, my shoemaker, lately come to town, and bespoke shoes, as also got him to find me a taylor to make me some clothes, my own being not yet in towne, nor Pym, my Lord Sandwich’s taylor.

1666-01-11 19:20 To Dr. Wilkins’s, where I never was before, and very kindly received and met with Dr. Merritt, and fine discourse among them to my great joy, so sober and so ingenious.

1666-01-11 17:15 My Lord Bruncker and I to Gresham College to have seen Mr. Hooke and a new invented chariot of Dr. Wilkins, but met with nobody at home.

1666-01-10 11:50 I had the opportunity I longed for, of seeing and saluting Mrs. Stokes, my little goldsmith’s wife in Paternoster Row, and there bespoke some thing, a silver chafing-dish for warming plates.

1666-01-10 10:4 To the ’Change, and there hear to our grief how the plague is encreased this week from seventy to eighty-nine. We have also great fear of our Hambrough fleete, of their meeting the Dutch.

1666-01-09 22:04 I with a glad heart to the office to write, my letters and so home to supper and bed, my wife mighty full of her work she hath to do in furnishing her bedchamber.

1666-01-08 22:07 After supper, and considering the uselessness of laying out so much money upon my wife’s closet, but only the chamber, to bed.

1666-01-08 09:55 To a place to look over some fine counterfeit damasks to hang my wife’s closet, and pitched upon one.

1666-01-08 09:22 My wife and I by coach to Bennett’s, in Paternoster Row, few shops there being yet open, and there bought velvett for a coat, and camelott for a cloak for myself.

1666-01-07 22:10 Being come home, my wife and I to look over our house and consider of laying out a little money to hang our bedchamber better than it is, and so resolved to go and buy something to-morrow, and so, with great joy in my heart for my coming once again hither, to bed.

1666-01-07 18:29 Before I went, comes Mrs. Knipp, just to speak with me privately, to excuse her not coming to me yesterday, complaining how like a devil her husband treats her, but will be with us in town a week hence, and so I kissed her and parted.

1666-01-07 18:12 Took leave of my landlady and daughters, having paid dear for what time I have spent there, but yet having been quiet and my health, I am very well contented therewith.

1666-01-06 15:37 Comes notice that my wife is come unexpectedly to me to town. So I to her. It is only to see what I do, and why I come not home; and she is in the right that I would have a little more of Mrs. Knipp’s company before I go away.

1666-01-06 13:04 I hoping to get Mrs. Knipp to us, having wrote a letter to her, calling myself “Dapper Dicky” in answer to hers of “Barbary Allen,” but could not and am told by the boy that carried it that he found her crying; but she lives a sad life with that ill-natured fellow her husband.

1666-01-06 08:12 Sir G. Carteret tells me that my Lord Sandwich do proceed on his journey with the greatest kindness that can be imagined from the King and Chancellor, which was joyful news to me.

1666-01-05 23:15 By and by comes little Mrs. Tooker and sat and supped with me, and I kept her very late talking and making her comb my head, and did what I will with her et tena grande plaisir con ella, tocando sa cosa con mi cosa, and hazendo la cosa par cette moyen. So late to bed.

1666-01-05 16:10 Reading a discourse about the River of Thames, the reason of its being choked up in several places with shelfes; which is plain is, by the encroachments made upon the River, and running out of causeways into the River at every wood-wharfe.

1666-01-05 09:32 A delightful thing it is to see the town full of people again as now it is; and shops begin to open, though in many places seven or eight together, and more, all shut; but yet the town is full, compared with what it used to be.

1666-01-05 09:20 I with my Lord Bruncker and Mrs. Williams by coach with four horses to London, to my Lord’s house in Covent-Guarden. But, Lord! what staring to see a nobleman’s coach come to town. And porters every where bow to us; and such begging of beggars!

1666-01-04 20:38 To my Lord Bruncker’s, thinking to have been merry, having appointed a meeting for Sir J. Minnes and his company and Mrs. Knipp again, but whatever hindered I know not, but no company come, which vexed me because it disappointed me of the glut of mirth I hoped for.

1666-01-04 14:58 Mr. Sheldon anon took leave and took Mrs. Barbary his niece home with him, and seems very thankful to me for the 10l. I did give him for my wife’s rent of his house, and I am sure I am beholding to him, for it was a great convenience to me.

1666-01-04 13:44 Home to dinner, where Mr. Sheldon come by invitation from Woolwich, and as merry as I could be with all my thoughts about me and my wife still in pain of her tooth.

1666-01-03 20:50 Then to dancing and supper, and mighty merry till Mr. Rolt come in, whose pain of the tooth-ake made him no company, and spoilt ours; so he away, and then my wife’s teeth fell of akeing, and she to bed.

1666-01-03 19:12 Home, and find all my good company I had bespoke, as Coleman and his wife, and Laneare, Knipp and her surly husband; and good music we had, and, among other things, Mrs. Coleman sang my words I set of “Beauty retire,” and I think it is a good song, and they praise it mightily.

1666-01-03 16:32 At the Duke of Albemarle’s with great joy I received the good news of the decrease of the plague this week to 70, and but 253 in all; which is the least Bill hath been known these twenty years in the City.

1666-01-03 15:10 All the morning till three in the afternoon examining and fitting up my Pursers’ paper and sent it away by an Express.

1666-01-02 23:20 Home to my lodgings and there endeavoured to have finished the examining my papers of Pursers’ business to have sent away to-night, but I was so sleepy with my late early risings and late goings to bed that I could not do it, but was forced to go to bed.

1666-01-02 22:10 I got into the coach where Mrs. Knipp was and got her upon my knee (the coach being full) and played with her breasts and sung, and at last set her at her house and so good night.

1666-01-02 18:10 To make our mirth the completer, Sir J. Minnes was in the highest pitch of mirth, and his mimicall tricks, that ever I saw, and most excellent pleasant company he is, and the best mimique that ever I saw, and certainly would have made an excellent actor.

1666-01-02 15:28 To my Lord Bruncker’s, and there find Sir J. Minnes and all his company, and Mr. Boreman and Mrs. Turner, but, above all, my dear Mrs. Knipp, with whom I sang, and in perfect pleasure I was to hear her sing, and especially her little Scotch song of “Barbary Allen”.

1666-01-02 05:45 Up by candlelight again, and wrote the greatest part of my business fair, and then to the office.

1666-01-01 18:04 Interrupted by Sir W. Warren’s coming, of whom I always learn something or other, his discourse being very good and his brains also.

1666-01-01 05:22 Called up by five o’clock, by my order, by Mr. Tooker, who wrote, while I dictated to him, my business of the Pursers.
