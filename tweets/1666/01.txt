1666-01-31 19:16 So after going to the Swan in the Palace, and sent for Spicer to discourse about my last Tangier tallys that have some of the words washed out with the rain, to have them new writ, I home.

1666-01-31 17:08 To White Hall, and to my great joy people begin to bustle up and down there, the King holding his resolution to be in town to-morrow.

1666-01-31 15:21 To my Lord Chancellor’s new house which he is building, only to view it, hearing so much from Mr. Evelyn of it; and, indeed, it is the finest pile I ever did see in my life, and will be a glorious house.

1666-01-31 12:55 Mr. Knightly is mighty solicitous, as I find many about the City that live near the churchyards, to have the churchyards covered with lime, and I think it is needfull, and ours I hope will be done.

1666-01-31 11:30 Seeing my neighbour Mr. Knightly walk alone from the ’Change, his family being not yet come to town, I did invite him home with me, and he dined with me, a very sober, pretty man he is.

1666-01-30 15:43 I went down by water to Deptford, and fetched up what money there was of W. Howe’s contingencies in the chest there, being 516l. 13s. 3d. and brought it home to dispose of.

1666-01-30 11:32 This is the first time I have been in this church since I left London for the plague, and it frighted me indeed to go through the church more than I thought it could have done, to see so many graves lie so high upon the churchyards where people have been buried of the plague.

1666-01-30 11:12 I presently into the church, thinking to see Mrs. Lethulier or Batelier, but did not, and a dull sermon of our young Lecturer, too bad.

1666-01-30 09:28 I home, finding the town keeping the day solemnly, it being the day of the King’s murther.

1666-01-29 21:15 After supper I made the ladies sing, and they have been taught, but, Lord! though I was forced to commend them, yet it was the saddest stuff I ever heard.

1666-01-29 16:57 Particularly Mr. Evelyn entertained me with discourse of an Infirmary, which he hath projected for the sick and wounded seamen against the next year, which I mightily approve of; and will endeavour to promote it.

1666-01-29 16:52 Mr. Evelyn and I rode together with excellent discourse till we come to Clapham, talking of the vanity and vices of the Court, which makes it a most contemptible thing; and indeed in all his discourse I find him a most worthy person.

1666-01-29 13:04 To Sir W. Coventry’s, whom I took occasion to thank for his favour and good thoughts of what service I did, desiring he would do the last act of friendship in telling me of my faults also. He told me he would be sure he would do that also, if there were any occasion for it.

1666-01-29 09:15 The Duke of Yorke told me that he knew nobody so fit as I for the Victualling business, and next, he was very glad to find that to give me for my encouragement, speaking very kindly of me.

1666-01-28 22:00 My mind being in a great delirium between joy for what the King and Duke have said to me and Sir W. Coventry, and trouble for my Lord Sandwich’s concernments, and how hard it will be for me to preserve myself from feeling thereof.

1666-01-28 18:32 I find Sir W. Pen, and he and I to discourse. I find him very much out of humour, so that I do not think matters go very well with him, and I am glad of it.

1666-01-28 16:52 The King come to me of himself, and told me, “Mr. Pepys,” says he, “I do give you thanks for your good service all this year, and I assure you I am very sensible of it.”

1666-01-28 16:05 Lord! to see in what difficulty I stand, that I dare not walk with Sir W. Coventry, for fear my Lord or Sir G. Carteret should see me; nor with either of them, for fear Sir W. Coventry should.

1666-01-28 15:44 I took my Lord Sandwich a little aside to know when I should wait on him, and where: he told me, and that it would be best to meet at his lodgings, without being seen to walk together.

1666-01-28 15:42 I found my Lord Sandwich there, poor man! I see with a melancholy face, and suffers his beard to grow on his upper lip more than usual.

1666-01-28 15:30 The Council being up, out comes the King, and I kissed his hand, and he grasped me very kindly by the hand. The Duke also, I kissed his, and he mighty kind, and Sir W. Coventry.

1666-01-28 14:12 To Court, where we find the King, and Duke, and Lords, all in council; so we walked up and down: there being none of the ladies come, and so much the more business I hope will be done.

1666-01-28 10:13 Only after I was in the house, heard a great dog bark, and so was afeard how I should get safe back again, and therefore drew my sword and scabbard out of my belt to have ready in my hand, but did not need to use it, but got safe into the coach again.

1666-01-28 10:10 At Brainford I ’light, having need to shit, and went into an Inne doore that stood open, found the house of office and used it, but saw no people.

1666-01-28 09:15 Took my Lord Bruncker’s coach with four horses and away toward Hampton Court, having a great deal of good discourse with him, particularly about his coming to lie at the office.

1666-01-28 06:32 Being dressed in my velvet coate and plain cravatt took a hackney coach provided ready for me by eight o’clock, and so to my Lord Bruncker’s with all my papers.

1666-01-27 21:09 To the office and there fitting myself in all points to give an account to the Duke and Mr. Coventry in all things, and in my Tangier business.

1666-01-26 15:21 D. Gawden and I to talk of the Victualling business of the Navy in what posture it is, which is very sad also for want of money.

1666-01-26 10:04 Sir G. Carteret bemoans the Kingdom as in a sad state, and with too much reason I doubt, having so many enemies about us and no friends abroad, nor money nor love at home.

1666-01-26 08:10 Pleased mightily with what my poor wife hath been doing these eight or ten days with her own hands, like a drudge in fitting the new hangings of our bed-chamber of blue, and putting the old red ones into my dressing-room.

1666-01-25 20:40 To the office business, and I find Wir W. Warren as cunning a man in all points as ever I met with in my life and mighty merry we were in the discourse of our own tricks.

1666-01-25 19:20 Sir W. Warren gives me good advice not to embark into trade so as to be seen to mind it, for it will do me hurt, and draw my mind off from my business and embroil my estate too soon.

1666-01-25 14:49 It is now certain that the King of France hath publickly declared war against us, and God knows how little fit we are for it.

1666-01-25 14:12 I to the office, where I did much business, and set my people to work against furnishing me to go to Hampton Court, where the King and Duke will be.

1666-01-24 22:22 I to my office-business late, and then home to supper and even sack for lack of a little wine, which I was forced to drink against my oath, but without pleasure.

1666-01-24 17:10 Mr. Creed and I to our accounts and very troublesome he is and with tricks which I found plainly and was vexed at.

1666-01-24 14:52 The greatest sight of all was, among other parcels of ships driven here and there in clusters together, one was quite overset and lay with her masts all along in the water, and keel above water.

1666-01-24 14:33 Above all, the pales on London-bridge on both sides were blown away, so that we were fain to stoop very low for fear of blowing off of the bridge.

1666-01-24 14:30 It was dangerous to walk the streets, the bricks and tiles falling from the houses that the whole streets were covered with them; and whole chimneys, nay, whole houses in two or three places, blowed down.

1666-01-24 14:10 Lord! what a dirty walk we had, and so strong the wind, that in the fields we many times could not carry our bodies against it, but were driven backwards.

1666-01-24 14:05 My Lord and I, the wind being again very furious, so as we durst not go by water, walked to London quite round the bridge, no boat being able to stirre.

1666-01-24 11:20 By water to Deptford to Sir G. Carteret’s house, where W. Howe met us, and there we opened the chests, and saw the poor sorry rubys which have caused all this ado to the undoing of W. Howe; though I am not much sorry for it, because of his pride and ill nature.

1666-01-24 09:35 To the office, where we met upon an occasion extraordinary of examining abuses of our clerks in taking money for examining of tickets, but nothing done in it.

1666-01-24 08:04 My Lord Bruncker called me up, and though it was a very foul, windy, and rainy morning, yet down to the waterside we went, but no boat could go, the storm continued so.

1666-01-24 05:30 A most furious storme all night and morning.

1666-01-23 19:30 Good news beyond all expectation of the decrease of the plague, being now but 79, and the whole but 272.

1666-01-23 16:49 After dinner to the office again all the afternoon, and much business with me.

1666-01-22 19:45 What, among other fine discourse pleased me most, was Sir G. Ent about Respiration; that it is not to this day known, or concluded on among physicians, nor to be done either, how the action is managed by nature, or for what use it is.

1666-01-22 18:20 Dr. Goddard did fill us with talk, in defence of his and his fellow physicians going out of town in the plague-time; saying that their particular patients were most gone out of town, and they left at liberty; and a great deal more, &c.

1666-01-22 17:30 To the Crowne taverne behind the Exchange by appointment, and there met the first meeting of Gresham College since the plague.

1666-01-22 14:01 I saw my Lord Bruncker ride in a charriot; where the coachman sits astride upon a pole over the horse, but do not touch the horse, which is a pretty odde thing; but it seems it is most easy for the horse, and, as they say, for the man also.

1666-01-22 13:50 My Lord Bruncker going with Dr. Wilkins, Mr. Hooke, and others, to Colonell Blunts, to consider again of the business of charriots, and to try their new invention.

1666-01-21 17:05 After dinner to my Tangier accounts and there stated them against to-morrow very distinctly for the Lords to see who meet tomorrow.

1666-01-21 11:50 Lay almost till noon merrily and with pleasure talking with my wife in bed.

1666-01-20 17:20 I sent my boy home for some papers, where, he staying longer than I would have him, I become angry, and boxed my boy when he came, that I do hurt my thumb so much, that I was not able to stir all the day after, and in great pain.

1666-01-19 17:20 Comes Sir H. Cholmley to me, and he and I to my house, there to settle his accounts with me, and so with great pleasure we agreed and great friends become, I think.

1666-01-19 09:30 It is a remarkable thing how infinitely naked all that end of the town, Covent-Garden, is at this day of people; while the City is almost as full again of people as ever it was.

1666-01-18 23:20 Mighty merry, and sing and dance with great pleasure; and I danced, who never did in company in my life, and Captain Cocke come for a little while and danced.

1666-01-18 16:04 I brought down my wife in her night-gown, she not being indeed very well, to the office to them and there by and by they parted all and my wife and I anon and Mercer, by coach, to Pierce’s.

1666-01-18 14:20 Vexed with Major Norwood’s coming, who takes it ill my not paying a bill of Exchange of his, and so troubled, so as being carried to Captain Cocke’s to dinner, where Mrs. Williams was, and Mrs. Knipp, I was not heartily merry, though a glass of wine did a little cheer me.

1666-01-18 07:55 Rode to London before office time, where I met a note at the door to invite me to supper to Mrs. Pierce’s because of Mrs. Knipp, who is in town and at her house.

1666-01-17 23:04 Anon to prayers the whole family, and then all to bed, I handsomely used, lying in the chamber Mr. Carteret formerly did, but sat up an hour talking sillily with Mr. Carteret and Mr. Marre, and so to bed.

1666-01-17 20:50 To supper, my Lady Wright very kind. After supper up to wait on my Lady Crew, who is the same weak silly lady as ever, asking such saintly questions.

1666-01-17 18:35 It was my Lord Crew’s desire that I should come, and chiefly to discourse with me of Lord Sandwich’s matters; and therein to persuade, what I had done already, that my Lord should sue out a pardon for his business of the prizes.

1666-01-17 17:43 After dinner, late took horse, having sent for Lashmore to go with me, and so he and I rode to Dagenhams in the dark.

1666-01-16 21:45 Mightily troubled at the news of the plague’s being encreased, and was much the saddest news that the plague hath brought me; because of the lateness of the year, and the fear of its continuing with us the next summer. The total being now 375, and the plague 158.

1666-01-16 11:57 I to London to the office, and there forgot, through business, to bespeak any dinner for my wife and Mrs. Pierce.

1666-01-15 22:20 Pierce and I to bed together, and he and I very merry to find how little and thin clothes they give us to cover us, so that we were fain to lie in our stockings and drawers, and lay all our coats and clothes upon the bed.

1666-01-15 20:07 By and by we all to supper, which the silly master of the feast commended, but, what with my being out of humour, and the badness of the meat dressed, I did never eat a worse supper in my life.

1666-01-15 18:40 Not so much as her husband could get her to come; but, which was a pleasant thing in all my anger, I asking him what he thought, whether she would come or no, he answered that, for his part, he could not so much as think.

1666-01-15 18:32 To Boreman’s, where the greatest disappointment that ever I saw in my life, much company, and all come with expectation of excess of mirth, but all blank through the waywardnesse of Mrs. Knipp, who, though she had appointed the night, could not be got to come.

1666-01-14 19:20 The fair creature went away, and proves one of the modestest women, and pretty, that ever I saw in my life, and my wife judges her so too.

1666-01-14 17:03 After sermon, comes my dear fair beauty of the Exchange, Mrs. Batelier, brought by her sister, an acquaintance of Mercer’s, to see my wife. I saluted her with as much pleasure as I had done any a great while.

1666-01-14 16:10 I propose Mr. Harman the upholster for a husband for Pall, to whom I have a great love and did heretofore love his former wife, and a civil man he is and careful in his way.

1666-01-14 10:55 I perform my vow to finish my journall and other things before I kiss any woman more or drink any wine, which I must be forced to do to-morrow if I go to Greenwich as I am invited by Mr. Boreman to hear Mrs. Knipp sing, and I would be glad to go, so as we may be merry.

1666-01-14 09:04 Long in bed, till raised by my new taylor, Mr. Penny, who comes and brings me my new velvet coat, very handsome, but plain, and a day hence will bring me my camelott cloak.

1666-01-13 21:50 I trust in God if I can but clear myself of my Lord Sandwich’s bond, wherein I am bound with him for 1000l. to T. Pepys, I shall do pretty well, come what will come.

1666-01-13 13:45 With my Lord Bruncker to Mrs. Williams’s, in Covent-Garden, to dinner (the first time I ever was there), and there met Captain Cocke; and pretty merry, though not perfectly so, because of the fear that there is of a great encrease again of the plague this week.

1666-01-12 21:38 I to the office and thence home to my poor wife, who works all day at home like a horse, at the making of her hangings for our chamber and the bed.

1666-01-12 10:40 Called at Wotton’s, my shoemaker, lately come to town, and bespoke shoes, as also got him to find me a taylor to make me some clothes, my own being not yet in towne, nor Pym, my Lord Sandwich’s taylor.

1666-01-11 19:20 To Dr. Wilkins’s, where I never was before, and very kindly received and met with Dr. Merritt, and fine discourse among them to my great joy, so sober and so ingenious.

1666-01-11 17:15 My Lord Bruncker and I to Gresham College to have seen Mr. Hooke and a new invented chariot of Dr. Wilkins, but met with nobody at home.

1666-01-10 11:50 I had the opportunity I longed for, of seeing and saluting Mrs. Stokes, my little goldsmith’s wife in Paternoster Row, and there bespoke some thing, a silver chafing-dish for warming plates.

1666-01-10 10:4 To the ’Change, and there hear to our grief how the plague is encreased this week from seventy to eighty-nine. We have also great fear of our Hambrough fleete, of their meeting the Dutch.

1666-01-09 22:04 I with a glad heart to the office to write, my letters and so home to supper and bed, my wife mighty full of her work she hath to do in furnishing her bedchamber.

1666-01-08 22:07 After supper, and considering the uselessness of laying out so much money upon my wife’s closet, but only the chamber, to bed.

1666-01-08 09:55 To a place to look over some fine counterfeit damasks to hang my wife’s closet, and pitched upon one.

1666-01-08 09:22 My wife and I by coach to Bennett’s, in Paternoster Row, few shops there being yet open, and there bought velvett for a coat, and camelott for a cloak for myself.

1666-01-07 22:10 Being come home, my wife and I to look over our house and consider of laying out a little money to hang our bedchamber better than it is, and so resolved to go and buy something to-morrow, and so, with great joy in my heart for my coming once again hither, to bed.

1666-01-07 18:29 Before I went, comes Mrs. Knipp, just to speak with me privately, to excuse her not coming to me yesterday, complaining how like a devil her husband treats her, but will be with us in town a week hence, and so I kissed her and parted.

1666-01-07 18:12 Took leave of my landlady and daughters, having paid dear for what time I have spent there, but yet having been quiet and my health, I am very well contented therewith.

1666-01-06 15:37 Comes notice that my wife is come unexpectedly to me to town. So I to her. It is only to see what I do, and why I come not home; and she is in the right that I would have a little more of Mrs. Knipp’s company before I go away.

1666-01-06 13:04 I hoping to get Mrs. Knipp to us, having wrote a letter to her, calling myself “Dapper Dicky” in answer to hers of “Barbary Allen,” but could not and am told by the boy that carried it that he found her crying; but she lives a sad life with that ill-natured fellow her husband.

1666-01-06 08:12 Sir G. Carteret tells me that my Lord Sandwich do proceed on his journey with the greatest kindness that can be imagined from the King and Chancellor, which was joyful news to me.

1666-01-05 23:15 By and by comes little Mrs. Tooker and sat and supped with me, and I kept her very late talking and making her comb my head, and did what I will with her et tena grande plaisir con ella, tocando sa cosa con mi cosa, and hazendo la cosa par cette moyen. So late to bed.

1666-01-05 16:10 Reading a discourse about the River of Thames, the reason of its being choked up in several places with shelfes; which is plain is, by the encroachments made upon the River, and running out of causeways into the River at every wood-wharfe.

1666-01-05 09:32 A delightful thing it is to see the town full of people again as now it is; and shops begin to open, though in many places seven or eight together, and more, all shut; but yet the town is full, compared with what it used to be.

1666-01-05 09:20 I with my Lord Bruncker and Mrs. Williams by coach with four horses to London, to my Lord’s house in Covent-Guarden. But, Lord! what staring to see a nobleman’s coach come to town. And porters every where bow to us; and such begging of beggars!

1666-01-04 20:38 To my Lord Bruncker’s, thinking to have been merry, having appointed a meeting for Sir J. Minnes and his company and Mrs. Knipp again, but whatever hindered I know not, but no company come, which vexed me because it disappointed me of the glut of mirth I hoped for.

1666-01-04 14:58 Mr. Sheldon anon took leave and took Mrs. Barbary his niece home with him, and seems very thankful to me for the 10l. I did give him for my wife’s rent of his house, and I am sure I am beholding to him, for it was a great convenience to me.

1666-01-04 13:44 Home to dinner, where Mr. Sheldon come by invitation from Woolwich, and as merry as I could be with all my thoughts about me and my wife still in pain of her tooth.

1666-01-03 20:50 Then to dancing and supper, and mighty merry till Mr. Rolt come in, whose pain of the tooth-ake made him no company, and spoilt ours; so he away, and then my wife’s teeth fell of akeing, and she to bed.

1666-01-03 19:12 Home, and find all my good company I had bespoke, as Coleman and his wife, and Laneare, Knipp and her surly husband; and good music we had, and, among other things, Mrs. Coleman sang my words I set of “Beauty retire,” and I think it is a good song, and they praise it mightily.

1666-01-03 16:32 At the Duke of Albemarle’s with great joy I received the good news of the decrease of the plague this week to 70, and but 253 in all; which is the least Bill hath been known these twenty years in the City.

1666-01-03 15:10 All the morning till three in the afternoon examining and fitting up my Pursers’ paper and sent it away by an Express.

1666-01-02 23:20 Home to my lodgings and there endeavoured to have finished the examining my papers of Pursers’ business to have sent away to-night, but I was so sleepy with my late early risings and late goings to bed that I could not do it, but was forced to go to bed.

1666-01-02 22:10 I got into the coach where Mrs. Knipp was and got her upon my knee (the coach being full) and played with her breasts and sung, and at last set her at her house and so good night.

1666-01-02 18:10 To make our mirth the completer, Sir J. Minnes was in the highest pitch of mirth, and his mimicall tricks, that ever I saw, and most excellent pleasant company he is, and the best mimique that ever I saw, and certainly would have made an excellent actor.

1666-01-02 15:28 To my Lord Bruncker’s, and there find Sir J. Minnes and all his company, and Mr. Boreman and Mrs. Turner, but, above all, my dear Mrs. Knipp, with whom I sang, and in perfect pleasure I was to hear her sing, and especially her little Scotch song of “Barbary Allen”.

1666-01-02 05:45 Up by candlelight again, and wrote the greatest part of my business fair, and then to the office.

1666-01-01 18:04 Interrupted by Sir W. Warren’s coming, of whom I always learn something or other, his discourse being very good and his brains also.

1666-01-01 05:22 Called up by five o’clock, by my order, by Mr. Tooker, who wrote, while I dictated to him, my business of the Pursers.
