1666-07-31 21:32   We having a victory over the Dutch just such as I could have wished, and as the kingdom was fit to bear, enough to give us the name of conquerors, and leave us masters of the sea, but without any such great matters done as should give the Duke of Albemarle any honour at all.

1666-07-31 15:40   I had some discourse with Povy, who is mightily discontented, I find, about his disappointments at Court; and says, of all places, if there be hell, it is here. No faith, no truth, no love, nor any agreement between man and wife, nor friends.

1666-07-31 11:11   Great bandying this day between Sir W. Coventry and my Lord Bruncker about Captain Cocke, which I am well pleased with, while I keep from any open relyance on either side, but rather on Sir W. Coventry’s.

1666-07-31 10:05   Colville was with me, and to my great joy I could now have all my money in, that I have in the world. But the times being open again, I think it is best to keep some of it abroad.

1666-07-31 09:22   We were mightily joyed with news brought by Sir J. Minnes and Sir W. Batten of the death of De Ruyter, but when Sir W. Coventry come, he told us there was no such thing, which quite dashed me again.

1666-07-30 20:04 r  Which I acknowledge; but it is because that the girl do take music mighty readily, and she do not, and music is the thing of the world that I love most, and all the pleasure almost that I can now take.

1666-07-30 20:02   Home; and to sing with my wife and Mercer in the garden; and coming in I find my wife plainly dissatisfied with me, that I can spend so much time with Mercer, teaching her to sing and could never take the pains with her.

1666-07-30 09:36   By and by comes my boy’s Lute-Master, and I did direct him hereafter to begin to teach him to play his part on the Theorbo, which he will do, and that in a little time I believe.

1666-07-29 22:04   Young Seamour is killed, the only captain slain. The Resolution burned; but, as they say, most of her crew and commander saved. This is all, only we keep the sea, which denotes a victory, or at least that we are not beaten; but no great matters to brag of, God knows.

1666-07-29 14:30   To our business of my microscope to be shown some of the observables of that, and then down to my office to look in a dark room with my glasses and tube, and most excellently things appeared indeed beyond imagination.

1666-07-29 11:45   A letter from Sir W. Coventry tells me that we have the victory. Beat them into the Weelings; had taken two of their great ships; but by the orders of the Generals they are burned.

1666-07-28 20:35 r But strange to hear my Lord Lauderdale say himself that he had rather hear a cat mew, than the best musique in the world; and the better the music, the more sick it makes him; and that of all instruments, he hates the lute most, and next to that, the baggpipe.

1666-07-28 20:30   At supper there played one of their servants upon the viallin some Scotch tunes only; several, and the best of their country, as they seemed to esteem them, by their praising and admiring them: but, Lord! the strangest ayre that ever I heard in my life, and all of one cast.

1666-07-28 14:15   I learning of my Lord Bruncker the principles of Optickes, and what it is that makes an object seem less or bigger and how much distance do lessen an object, and that it is not the eye that can tell distance, but it is only an act of reason comparing of one mark with another.

1666-07-28 13:22 r But the Doctor, I think, did well observe that creatures do naturally and from the first, before they have had experience to try, do love such a food rather than another, and that all children love fruit, and none brought to flesh, but against their wills at first.

1666-07-28 13:19 r My Lord Bruncker made one or two objections to it that creatures find their food proper for their teeth rather than that the teeth were fitted for the food.

1666-07-28 13:11   Very pretty discourse of Dr. Charleton’s, concerning Nature’s fashioning every creature’s teeth according to the food she intends them; and that men’s, it is plain, was not for flesh, but for fruit, and that he can at any time tell the food of a beast unknown by the teeth.

1666-07-27 19:30   Sir W. Coventry was very free with me in speaking his mind of the unruliness of the young gentlemen captains; and what a loss the King hath of his old men, and now of this Hannam, of the Resolution, if he be dead, and that there is but few old sober men in the fleet.

1666-07-27 18:22   I away by water from the Old Swan to White Hall. The waterman tells me that news is come that our ship Resolution is burnt, and that we had sunk four or five of the enemy’s ships.

1666-07-26 18:04   To my Lord Chancellor’s new house, and there up to the leads where I find my Lord Chamberlain, Lauderdale, Sir Robert Murray, and others, and do find it the most delightful place for prospect that ever was in the world, it even ravishing me, and that is all I can say of it.

1666-07-26 16:40   To Mrs. Pierce’s, there to find my wife. Mrs. Pierce hath lain in of a boy about a month. The boy is dead this day.

1666-07-25 17:48   Back toward Westminster, and there met Mrs. Burroughs, whom I had a mind to meet, but being undressed did appear a mighty ordinary woman.

1666-07-25 16:04   I away to Mrs. Martin’s new lodgings, where I find her, and was with her close, but, Lord! how big she is already. She is, at least seems, in mighty trouble for her husband at sea, when I am sure she cares not for him.

1666-07-25 13:38   We dined with the meat that come from the King’s table; which was most excellent, with most brave drink cooled in ice (which at this hot time was welcome), and I drinking no wine, had metheglin for the King’s owne drinking, which did please me mightily.

1666-07-25 10:50 r And so every body to the Parke, and by and by the chappel done, and the King and Duke into the bowling-green, and upon the leads, whither I went, and there the guns were plain to be heard; though it was pretty to hear how confident some would be in the loudnesse of the guns.

1666-07-25 10:03   At White Hall we find the Court gone to Chappel, it being St. James’s day. And by and by, while they are at chappel, and we waiting chappel being done, come people out of the Parke, telling us that the guns are heard plain.

1666-07-24 15:40   To the office, there to set up again my frames about my Platts, which I have got to be all gilded, and look very fine.

1666-07-23 18:54 r The French are not yet joined with the Dutch, which do dissatisfy the Hollanders, and if they should have a defeat, will undo De Witt; the people generally of Holland do hate this league with France.

1666-07-23 18:50   All full of expectation of the fleet’s engagement, but it is not yet. Sir W. Coventry says they are eighty-nine men-of-war, but one fifth-rate, and that, the Sweepstakes, which carries forty guns. They are most infinitely manned.

1666-07-23 13:04   Home and to dinner, where I confess, reflecting upon the ease and plenty that I live in, of money, goods, servants, honour, every thing, I could not but with hearty thanks to Almighty God ejaculate my thanks to Him while I was at dinner, to myself.

1666-07-23 11:03   Colvill tells me he hath 1000l. ready for me upon a tally; which pleases me, and yet I know not now what to do with it, having already as much money as is fit for me to have in the house, but I will have it.

1666-07-23 08:47   Sympson, the Joyner, and I with great pains contriving presses to put my books up in: they now growing numerous, and lying one upon another on my chairs, I lose the use to avoid the trouble of removing them, when I would open a book.

1666-07-22 16:54 r For flowers they are best seen in a little plat by themselves; besides, their borders spoil the walks of another garden: and then for fruit, the best way is to have walls built circularly one within another, to the South, on purpose for fruit.

1666-07-22 16:52 r So our business here being ayre, this is the best way, only with a little mixture of statues, or pots, which may be handsome, and so filled with another pot of such and such a flower or greene as the season of the year will bear.

1666-07-22 16:50   Hugh May is a very ingenious man. Among other things, discoursing of the present fashion of gardens to make them plain, that we have the best walks of gravell in the world, France having no nor Italy; and our green of our bowling allies is better than any they have.

1666-07-22 12:02   Up, and to my chamber, and there till noon mighty busy, setting money matters and other things of mighty moment to rights to the great content of my mind.

1666-07-21 19:22   Sir W. Pen is gone down to Sheernesse today to see things made ready against the fleet shall come in again, which makes Pett mad, and calls him dissembling knave.

1666-07-21 12:35   Commissioner Pett (newly come to town) tells me how infinite the disorders are among the commanders and all officers of the fleet. No discipline, nothing but swearing and cursing, and every body doing what they please.

1666-07-20 22:15   Sir W. Pen and I supped together upon the seat in the garden, and thence, he gone, my wife and Mercer come and walked and sang late, and then home to bed.

1666-07-20 13:58   To dinner, there coming young Mrs. Daniel and her sister Sarah, and dined with us; and old Mr. Hawly, whose condition pities me, he being forced to turne under parish-clerk at St. Gyles’s, I think at the other end of the town.

1666-07-20 11:45   Home, calling at the stationer’s for some paper fit to varnish, and in my way home met with Lovett, to whom I gave it, and he did present me with a varnished staffe, very fine and light to walk with.

1666-07-20 10:52   I to Lovett’s, there to see how my picture goes on to be varnished (a fine Crucifix), which will be very fine; and here I saw some fine prints, brought from France by Sir Thomas Crew, who is lately returned.

1666-07-20 09:03   The Duke of York did bid Sir W. Pen to stay to discourse with him and the King about business of the fleet, which troubled me a little, but it was only out of envy, for which I blame myself, having no reason to expect to be called to advise in a matter I understand not.

1666-07-19 14:30   Balty takes his leave of us, he going away just now towards the fleet, where he will pass through one great engagement more before he be two days older, I believe.

1666-07-19 11:55   To the office, where all the morning sitting. Full of wants of money, and much stores to buy, for to replenish the stores, and no money to do it with, nor anybody to trust us without it.

1666-07-18 16:37   I down the river to Greenwich, about business, and thence walked to Woolwich, reading “The Rivall Ladys” all the way, and find it a most pleasant and fine writ play.

1666-07-18 12:05 r So full of work Lilly is, that he was fain to take his table-book out to see how his time is appointed, and appointed six days hence for him to come between seven and eight in the morning.

1666-07-18 11:47   With Sir W. Pen home, calling at Lilly’s, to have a time appointed when to be drawn among the other Commanders of Flags the last year’s fight.

1666-07-18 09:17 r Sir W. Coventry did move that it would be of use to send this down to the fleet, for the recovering of the spirits of the officers and seamen; who are under great dejectedness for want of knowing that they did do any thing against the enemy.

1666-07-18 09:10   The Duke of Yorke did say that now at length he is come to a sure knowledge that the Dutch did lose in the late engagements twenty-nine captains and thirteen ships.

1666-07-17 16:30   I did bid Balty to agree with the Dutch painter, which he once led me to, to see landskipps, for a winter piece of snow, which indeed is a good piece, and costs me but 40s, which I would not take the money again for, it being, I think, very good.

1666-07-17 15:20   I did take my wife out to the New Exchange to buy things. She there while I with Balty went and bought a common riding-cloak for myself, to save my best. It cost me but 30s, and will do my turn mighty well.

1666-07-16 19:32   I passed the day with Balty, who is come from sea for a day or two before the fight, and I perceive could be willing fairly to be out of the next fight, and I cannot much blame him, he having no reason by his place to be there.

1666-07-16 16:25   A wonderful dark sky, and shower of rain this morning, which at Harwich proved so too with a shower of hail as big as walnuts.

1666-07-16 16:20   Lay in great pain in bed all the morning and most of the afternoon, being in much pain, making little or no water, and indeed having little within to make any with. And had great twinges with the wind all the day in my belly with wind.

1666-07-16 06:38   I was in mighty pain all night long of the winde griping of my belly and making of me shit often and vomit too, which is a thing not usual with me, but this I impute to the milk that I drank after so much beer.

1666-07-15 20:15   I took up my wife and Betty Michell and her husband, and away into the fields as far as beyond Hackny, in our way drinking a great deale of milke, which I drank to take away my heartburne, but all the way home I did break abundance of wind behind.

1666-07-15 17:22   I to the Abbey and there called Michell, and so walked in great pain, having new shoes on, as far as Fleet Street and there got a coach, and so in some little ease home and there drank a great deal of small beer.

1666-07-15 15:04   I to White Hall but met with nobody to discourse with, having no great mind to be found idling there and be asked questions of the fleet, so walked only through to the Park and there, it being mighty hot and I weary, lay down by the canaille, upon the grasse, and slept awhile.

1666-07-14 22:14   After a song in the garden, which, and after dinner, is now the greatest pleasure I take, and indeed do please me mightily, to bed, after washing my legs and feet with warm water in my kitchen.

1666-07-14 17:08 r I sent for young Michell and employed him all the afternoon about weighing and shipping off of the corke, having by this means an opportunity of getting him 30 or 40s.

1666-07-14 09:37   I down to Thames-streete, and there agreed for four or five tons of corke, to send this day to the fleet, being a new device to make barricados with, instead of junke.

1666-07-13 17:04   Our fleet being now in all points ready to sail, but for the carrying of the two or three new ships, which will keep them a day or two or three more.

1666-07-12 18:25 r All the way most excellent pretty company. I had her lips as much as I would, and a mighty pretty woman she is and very modest and yet kinde in all fair ways.

1666-07-12 18:22 r I quite through with Mrs. Burroughs, and so into the fields Uxbridge way, and then back and to Paddington, and then back to Lyssen green, a place the coachman led me to (I never knew in my life) and there we eat and drank and so back to Charing Crosse, and there I set her down.

1666-07-12 16:30   I by coach and took my pretty widow, Mrs. Burroughs, up in Fenchurch Street and away through the City, hiding my face as much as I could, but she being mighty pretty and well enough clad, I was not afeard, but only lest somebody should see me and think me idle.

1666-07-12 15:55   At noon home and thought to have slept, my head all day being full of business and yet sleepy and out of order, and so I lay down on my bed in my gowne to sleep, but I could not, therefore about three o’clock up and to dinner and thence to the office.

1666-07-12 07:20   Sir W. Coventry hath no esteem nor kindness for the Duke’s matters, but, contrarily, do slight him and them; and I pray God the Kingdom do not pay too dear by this jarring; though this blockheaded Duke I did never expect better from.

1666-07-11 23:15 r I to the Tower, and got a couple of musquetiers with me, and Griffen and my boy Tom and so down; and, being come, found none on board but two or three servants, looking to horses and doggs, there on board, and, seeing no more, I staid not long there.

1666-07-11 22:28   I met with a command to go to a galliott at Greenwich that is to carry the Savoy Envoyé over, and we fear there may be many Frenchmen there on board; I have a power to seize all that have not passes from one of the Secretarys of State, and to bring them in custody some whither.

1666-07-11 22:10   By coach took up my wife at her sister’s, and so away to Islington, she and I alone, and so through Hackney, and home late, our discourse being about laying up of some money safe in prevention to the troubles I am afeard we may have in the state.

1666-07-11 09:50 r The King did speak most in contempt of the ceremoniousnesse of the King of Spain, that he do nothing but under some ridiculous form or other, and will not piss but another must hold the chamber-pot.

1666-07-11 09:25   By and by called to wait on the Duke, the King being present; and there agreed, among other things, of the places to build the ten new great ships ordered to be built, and as to the relief of prisoners in Holland.

1666-07-11 08:22   I away by coach to St. James’s, and there hear that the Duchesse is lately brought to bed of a boy.

1666-07-10 20:10   The two Mrs. Bateliers and we and Mrs. Mercer, the mother, and her daughter Anne, and our Mercer, to supper to a good venison-pasty and other good things, and had a good supper, and very merry, Mistresses Bateliers being both very good-humoured.

1666-07-10 17:14   I to the Tower to speak with Sir John Robinson about business, principally the bad condition of the pressed men for want of clothes, so it is represented from the fleet, and so to provide them shirts and stockings and drawers.

1666-07-10 15:10 r Wwhen the rest were gone, I did call one woman to me that I heard complain only and pity her husband and did give her some money, and she blessed me and went away.

1666-07-10 14:35 r The women got into the garden, and come all to my closet window, and I confess their cries were so sad for money, and laying down the condition of their families and their husbands, that I do most heartily pity them, and was ready to cry to hear them, but cannot help them.

1666-07-10 14:12 r My wife and I were afeard to send a venison-pasty that we have for supper to-night to the cook’s to be baked, for fear of their offering violence to it: but it went, and no hurt done.

1666-07-10 14:07   To the office; the yard being very full of women (I believe above three hundred) coming to get money for their husbands and friends that are prisoners in Holland; and they lay clamouring and swearing and cursing us.

1666-07-10 10:15   Presented Sir W. Coventry with my little book made up of Lovett’s varnished paper, which he and the whole board liked very well.

1666-07-09 17:22 r I left them, having showed them my chamber, and 1000l. in gold, which they wondered at, and given them sweetmeats, and shown my aunt Wight my father’s picture, which she admires.

1666-07-09 16:40   Home, and there find my aunt Wight with my wife come to take her leave of her, being going for the summer into the country; there was also Mrs Mary Batelier and her sister, newly come out of France, a black, very black woman, but mighty good-natured people both, as ever I saw.

1666-07-09 15:50   Lovett and his wife brought me some sheets of paper varnished on one side, which lies very white and smooth and will do our business most exactly, and will come up to the use that I intended them for, and I am apt to believe will be an invention that will take in the world.

1666-07-08 21:30   I expected to have had news sent me of Knipp’s christening to-day; but, hearing nothing of it, I did not go, though I fear it is but their forgetfulness and so I may disappoint them.

1666-07-08 10:04   To church, wife and Mercer and I, in expectation of hearing some mighty preacher to-day, Mrs. Mary Batelier sending us word so; but it proved our ordinary silly lecturer, which made me merry, and she laughed upon us to see her mistake.

1666-07-08 06:32   Up, and pretty well of my pain, so that it did not trouble me at all, and I do clearly find that my pain in my back was nothing but only accompanied my bruise in my stones.

1666-07-08 06:08   It proved the hottest night that ever I was in in my life, and thundered and lightened all night long and rained hard.

1666-07-08 01:05   Lord! to see in what fears I lay a good while, hearing of a noise of somebody walking in the house: so rung the bell, and it was my maids going to bed. But the fear of being robbed, having so much money in the house, was very great, and is still so, and do much disquiet me.

1666-07-07 17:24   In some pain in my back by some bruise or other I have given myself in my right testicle this morning, and the pain lies there and hath done, and in my back thereupon all this day.

1666-07-07 14:50   Creed tells me he finds all things mighty dull at Court; and that they now begin to lie long in bed; it being, as we suppose, not seemly for them to be found playing and gaming as they used to be.

1666-07-06 17:22   I met with a letter from Bab Allen, to invite me to be god-father to her boy, with Mrs. Williams, which I consented to, but know not the time when it is to be.

1666-07-06 16:29   To Lumbard Streete, and received 2000l, and carried it home: whereof 1000l. in gold. The greatest quantity not only that I ever had of gold, but that ever I saw together, and is not much above half a 100lb. bag full, but is much weightier.

1666-07-06 10:05   It is a pretty thing to observe that a man shall see many women now-a-days of mean sort in the streets, but no men; men being so afeard of the press.

1666-07-06 09:34   To Lumbard Street, about the getting of a good sum of money, thence home, in preparation for my having some good sum in my hands, for fear of a trouble in the State, that I may not have all I have in the world out of my hands and so be left a beggar.

1666-07-05 22:20   I to my office and Lumbard Street about money, and then to my office again, very busy, and so till late, and then a song with my wife and Mercer in the garden, and so with great content to bed.

1666-07-04 20:55 r Sir W. Pen did talk very rationally to me, insomuch that I took more pleasure this night in hearing him discourse, than I ever did in my life in any thing that he said.

1666-07-04 20:28 r In the business of fore-castles, which Sir W. Pen did oppose, all the world sees now the use of them for shelter of men.

1666-07-04 20:12 r 1. That we must fight in a line, whereas we fight promiscuously; 2. We must not desert ships of our own in distress; 3. That ships, when they are a little shattered, must not take the liberty to come in of themselves, but refit themselves the best they can, and stay out.

1666-07-04 20:10   Sir W. Pen come to me, and we walked together, and talked of the late fight. He says three things must remedied, or else we shall be undone by this fleet...

1666-07-04 10:20   To St. James’s, and did our business with the Duke, discoursing about the places where to build ten great ships; the King and Council have resolved on none to be under third-rates; but it is impossible to do it, unless we have more money towards the doing it than yet we have.

1666-07-04 07:05   Thanks be to God, the plague is, as I hear, encreased but two this week; but in the country in several places it rages mightily, and particularly in Colchester, where it hath long been, and is believed will quite depopulate the place.

1666-07-04 00:05   Home and till midnight about settling my last month’s accounts wherein I have been interrupted by public business, that I did not state them two or three days ago, but I do now to my great joy find myself worth above 5600l, for which the Lord’s name be praised!

1666-07-03 20:20   News come yesterday from Harwich, that the Dutch had appeared upon our coast with their fleet, and we believe did go to the Gun-fleete, and they are supposed to be there now.

1666-07-03 16:22 r Mr. Finch told me Mr. Prin’s character; that he is a man of mighty labour and reading and memory, but the worst judge of matters, or layer together of what he hath read, in the world.

1666-07-03 16:03   Mr. Finch, one of the Commissioners, and I walked two hours together in the garden, talking of many things; sometimes of Mr. Povy, whose vanity, prodigality, neglect of his business, and committing it to unfit hands hath undone him and outed him of all his public employments.

1666-07-02 18:32 r With good words, and cajoling the ringleader into the Tower (where, when he was come, he was clapped up in the hole), they were got very quietly; but I think it is much if they do not run the vessel on ground.

1666-07-02 17:37 r I meant to have spoke with Bagwell’s mother, but her face was sore, and so I did not, but returned and upon the water found one of the vessels loaden with the Bridewell birds in a great mutiny, and they would not sail.

1666-07-02 15:48   Down to Deptford; but to see what a consternation there is upon the water by reason of this great press, that nothing is able to get a waterman to appear almost.

1666-07-02 11:04   Like an asse at Paul’s, prating Colonel Cox did take me out of my way on purpose to show me the gate (the little north gate) where he had two men shot close by him on each hand, and his own hair burnt by a bullet-shot in the insurrection of Venner, and himself escaped.

1666-07-02 07:32   Out of curiosity to Bridewell to see the pressed men, where there are about 300; but so unruly that I durst not go among them: and they have reason to be so, having been kept these three days prisoners, with little or no victuals.

1666-07-02 00:08 r Besides, to see poor patient labouring men and housekeepers, leaving poor wives and families, taking up on a sudden by strangers, was very hard, and that without press-money, but forced against all law to be gone. It is a great tyranny.

1666-07-02 00:05 r Lord! how some poor women did cry; and in my life I never did see such natural expression of passion as I did here in some women’s bewailing themselves, and running to every parcel of men that were brought to look for their husbands, that it grieved me to the heart to hear them.

1666-07-02 00:03   Back to the Tower several times, about the business of the pressed men, and late at it till twelve at night, shipping of them.

1666-07-01 17:38   Down to Deptford to the yard, thinking to have seen Bagwell’s wife, whose husband is gone yesterday back to the fleet, but I did not see her, so missed what I went for.

1666-07-01 13:58 r Though I do not love Sir W. Pen, yet I find it necessary to keep in with him; his good service at Shearnesse in getting out the fleet being much taken notice of, and reported to the King and Duke, even from the Prince and Duke of Albemarle themselves.

1666-07-01 13:55   While I was hard at it comes Sir W. Pen to town, which I little expected, having invited my Lady and her daughter Pegg to dine with me to-day; which at noon they did, and Sir W. Pen with them: and pretty merry we were.

1666-07-01 10:20   To the office receiving letters, two or three one after another from Sir W. Coventry, and sent as many to him, being full of variety of business and hurry.
