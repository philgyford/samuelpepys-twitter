1666-07-16 19:32   I passed the day with Balty, who is come from sea for a day or two before the fight, and I perceive could be willing fairly to be out of the next fight, and I cannot much blame him, he having no reason by his place to be there.

1666-07-16 16:25   A wonderful dark sky, and shower of rain this morning, which at Harwich proved so too with a shower of hail as big as walnuts.

1666-07-16 16:20   Lay in great pain in bed all the morning and most of the afternoon, being in much pain, making little or no water, and indeed having little within to make any with. And had great twinges with the wind all the day in my belly with wind.

1666-07-16 06:38   I was in mighty pain all night long of the winde griping of my belly and making of me shit often and vomit too, which is a thing not usual with me, but this I impute to the milk that I drank after so much beer.

1666-07-15 20:15   I took up my wife and Betty Michell and her husband, and away into the fields as far as beyond Hackny, in our way drinking a great deale of milke, which I drank to take away my heartburne, but all the way home I did break abundance of wind behind.

1666-07-15 17:22   I to the Abbey and there called Michell, and so walked in great pain, having new shoes on, as far as Fleet Street and there got a coach, and so in some little ease home and there drank a great deal of small beer.

1666-07-15 15:04   I to White Hall but met with nobody to discourse with, having no great mind to be found idling there and be asked questions of the fleet, so walked only through to the Park and there, it being mighty hot and I weary, lay down by the canaille, upon the grasse, and slept awhile.

1666-07-14 22:14   After a song in the garden, which, and after dinner, is now the greatest pleasure I take, and indeed do please me mightily, to bed, after washing my legs and feet with warm water in my kitchen.

1666-07-14 17:08 r I sent for young Michell and employed him all the afternoon about weighing and shipping off of the corke, having by this means an opportunity of getting him 30 or 40s.

1666-07-14 09:37   I down to Thames-streete, and there agreed for four or five tons of corke, to send this day to the fleet, being a new device to make barricados with, instead of junke.

1666-07-13 17:04   Our fleet being now in all points ready to sail, but for the carrying of the two or three new ships, which will keep them a day or two or three more.

1666-07-12 18:25 r All the way most excellent pretty company. I had her lips as much as I would, and a mighty pretty woman she is and very modest and yet kinde in all fair ways.

1666-07-12 18:22 r I quite through with Mrs. Burroughs, and so into the fields Uxbridge way, and then back and to Paddington, and then back to Lyssen green, a place the coachman led me to (I never knew in my life) and there we eat and drank and so back to Charing Crosse, and there I set her down.

1666-07-12 16:30   I by coach and took my pretty widow, Mrs. Burroughs, up in Fenchurch Street and away through the City, hiding my face as much as I could, but she being mighty pretty and well enough clad, I was not afeard, but only lest somebody should see me and think me idle.

1666-07-12 15:55   At noon home and thought to have slept, my head all day being full of business and yet sleepy and out of order, and so I lay down on my bed in my gowne to sleep, but I could not, therefore about three o’clock up and to dinner and thence to the office.

1666-07-12 07:20   Sir W. Coventry hath no esteem nor kindness for the Duke’s matters, but, contrarily, do slight him and them; and I pray God the Kingdom do not pay too dear by this jarring; though this blockheaded Duke I did never expect better from.

1666-07-11 23:15 r I to the Tower, and got a couple of musquetiers with me, and Griffen and my boy Tom and so down; and, being come, found none on board but two or three servants, looking to horses and doggs, there on board, and, seeing no more, I staid not long there.

1666-07-11 22:28   I met with a command to go to a galliott at Greenwich that is to carry the Savoy Envoyé over, and we fear there may be many Frenchmen there on board; I have a power to seize all that have not passes from one of the Secretarys of State, and to bring them in custody some whither.

1666-07-11 22:10   By coach took up my wife at her sister’s, and so away to Islington, she and I alone, and so through Hackney, and home late, our discourse being about laying up of some money safe in prevention to the troubles I am afeard we may have in the state.

1666-07-11 09:50 r The King did speak most in contempt of the ceremoniousnesse of the King of Spain, that he do nothing but under some ridiculous form or other, and will not piss but another must hold the chamber-pot.

1666-07-11 09:25   By and by called to wait on the Duke, the King being present; and there agreed, among other things, of the places to build the ten new great ships ordered to be built, and as to the relief of prisoners in Holland.

1666-07-11 08:22   I away by coach to St. James’s, and there hear that the Duchesse is lately brought to bed of a boy.

1666-07-10 20:10   The two Mrs. Bateliers and we and Mrs. Mercer, the mother, and her daughter Anne, and our Mercer, to supper to a good venison-pasty and other good things, and had a good supper, and very merry, Mistresses Bateliers being both very good-humoured.

1666-07-10 17:14   I to the Tower to speak with Sir John Robinson about business, principally the bad condition of the pressed men for want of clothes, so it is represented from the fleet, and so to provide them shirts and stockings and drawers.

1666-07-10 15:10 r Wwhen the rest were gone, I did call one woman to me that I heard complain only and pity her husband and did give her some money, and she blessed me and went away.

1666-07-10 14:35 r The women got into the garden, and come all to my closet window, and I confess their cries were so sad for money, and laying down the condition of their families and their husbands, that I do most heartily pity them, and was ready to cry to hear them, but cannot help them.

1666-07-10 14:12 r My wife and I were afeard to send a venison-pasty that we have for supper to-night to the cook’s to be baked, for fear of their offering violence to it: but it went, and no hurt done.

1666-07-10 14:07   To the office; the yard being very full of women (I believe above three hundred) coming to get money for their husbands and friends that are prisoners in Holland; and they lay clamouring and swearing and cursing us.

1666-07-10 10:15   Presented Sir W. Coventry with my little book made up of Lovett’s varnished paper, which he and the whole board liked very well.

1666-07-09 17:22 r I left them, having showed them my chamber, and 1000l. in gold, which they wondered at, and given them sweetmeats, and shown my aunt Wight my father’s picture, which she admires.

1666-07-09 16:40   Home, and there find my aunt Wight with my wife come to take her leave of her, being going for the summer into the country; there was also Mrs Mary Batelier and her sister, newly come out of France, a black, very black woman, but mighty good-natured people both, as ever I saw.

1666-07-09 15:50   Lovett and his wife brought me some sheets of paper varnished on one side, which lies very white and smooth and will do our business most exactly, and will come up to the use that I intended them for, and I am apt to believe will be an invention that will take in the world.

1666-07-08 21:30   I expected to have had news sent me of Knipp’s christening to-day; but, hearing nothing of it, I did not go, though I fear it is but their forgetfulness and so I may disappoint them.

1666-07-08 10:04   To church, wife and Mercer and I, in expectation of hearing some mighty preacher to-day, Mrs. Mary Batelier sending us word so; but it proved our ordinary silly lecturer, which made me merry, and she laughed upon us to see her mistake.

1666-07-08 06:32   Up, and pretty well of my pain, so that it did not trouble me at all, and I do clearly find that my pain in my back was nothing but only accompanied my bruise in my stones.

1666-07-08 06:08   It proved the hottest night that ever I was in in my life, and thundered and lightened all night long and rained hard.

1666-07-08 01:05   Lord! to see in what fears I lay a good while, hearing of a noise of somebody walking in the house: so rung the bell, and it was my maids going to bed. But the fear of being robbed, having so much money in the house, was very great, and is still so, and do much disquiet me.

1666-07-07 17:24   In some pain in my back by some bruise or other I have given myself in my right testicle this morning, and the pain lies there and hath done, and in my back thereupon all this day.

1666-07-07 14:50   Creed tells me he finds all things mighty dull at Court; and that they now begin to lie long in bed; it being, as we suppose, not seemly for them to be found playing and gaming as they used to be.

1666-07-06 17:22   I met with a letter from Bab Allen, to invite me to be god-father to her boy, with Mrs. Williams, which I consented to, but know not the time when it is to be.

1666-07-06 16:29   To Lumbard Streete, and received 2000l, and carried it home: whereof 1000l. in gold. The greatest quantity not only that I ever had of gold, but that ever I saw together, and is not much above half a 100lb. bag full, but is much weightier.

1666-07-06 10:05   It is a pretty thing to observe that a man shall see many women now-a-days of mean sort in the streets, but no men; men being so afeard of the press.

1666-07-06 09:34   To Lumbard Street, about the getting of a good sum of money, thence home, in preparation for my having some good sum in my hands, for fear of a trouble in the State, that I may not have all I have in the world out of my hands and so be left a beggar.

1666-07-05 22:20   I to my office and Lumbard Street about money, and then to my office again, very busy, and so till late, and then a song with my wife and Mercer in the garden, and so with great content to bed.

1666-07-04 20:55 r Sir W. Pen did talk very rationally to me, insomuch that I took more pleasure this night in hearing him discourse, than I ever did in my life in any thing that he said.

1666-07-04 20:28 r In the business of fore-castles, which Sir W. Pen did oppose, all the world sees now the use of them for shelter of men.

1666-07-04 20:12 r 1. That we must fight in a line, whereas we fight promiscuously; 2. We must not desert ships of our own in distress; 3. That ships, when they are a little shattered, must not take the liberty to come in of themselves, but refit themselves the best they can, and stay out.

1666-07-04 20:10   Sir W. Pen come to me, and we walked together, and talked of the late fight. He says three things must remedied, or else we shall be undone by this fleet...

1666-07-04 10:20   To St. James’s, and did our business with the Duke, discoursing about the places where to build ten great ships; the King and Council have resolved on none to be under third-rates; but it is impossible to do it, unless we have more money towards the doing it than yet we have.

1666-07-04 07:05   Thanks be to God, the plague is, as I hear, encreased but two this week; but in the country in several places it rages mightily, and particularly in Colchester, where it hath long been, and is believed will quite depopulate the place.

1666-07-04 00:05   Home and till midnight about settling my last month’s accounts wherein I have been interrupted by public business, that I did not state them two or three days ago, but I do now to my great joy find myself worth above 5600l, for which the Lord’s name be praised!

1666-07-03 20:20   News come yesterday from Harwich, that the Dutch had appeared upon our coast with their fleet, and we believe did go to the Gun-fleete, and they are supposed to be there now.

1666-07-03 16:22 r Mr. Finch told me Mr. Prin’s character; that he is a man of mighty labour and reading and memory, but the worst judge of matters, or layer together of what he hath read, in the world.

1666-07-03 16:03   Mr. Finch, one of the Commissioners, and I walked two hours together in the garden, talking of many things; sometimes of Mr. Povy, whose vanity, prodigality, neglect of his business, and committing it to unfit hands hath undone him and outed him of all his public employments.

1666-07-02 18:32 r With good words, and cajoling the ringleader into the Tower (where, when he was come, he was clapped up in the hole), they were got very quietly; but I think it is much if they do not run the vessel on ground.

1666-07-02 17:37 r I meant to have spoke with Bagwell’s mother, but her face was sore, and so I did not, but returned and upon the water found one of the vessels loaden with the Bridewell birds in a great mutiny, and they would not sail.

1666-07-02 15:48   Down to Deptford; but to see what a consternation there is upon the water by reason of this great press, that nothing is able to get a waterman to appear almost.

1666-07-02 11:04   Like an asse at Paul’s, prating Colonel Cox did take me out of my way on purpose to show me the gate (the little north gate) where he had two men shot close by him on each hand, and his own hair burnt by a bullet-shot in the insurrection of Venner, and himself escaped.

1666-07-02 07:32   Out of curiosity to Bridewell to see the pressed men, where there are about 300; but so unruly that I durst not go among them: and they have reason to be so, having been kept these three days prisoners, with little or no victuals.

1666-07-02 00:08 r Besides, to see poor patient labouring men and housekeepers, leaving poor wives and families, taking up on a sudden by strangers, was very hard, and that without press-money, but forced against all law to be gone. It is a great tyranny.

1666-07-02 00:05 r Lord! how some poor women did cry; and in my life I never did see such natural expression of passion as I did here in some women’s bewailing themselves, and running to every parcel of men that were brought to look for their husbands, that it grieved me to the heart to hear them.

1666-07-02 00:03   Back to the Tower several times, about the business of the pressed men, and late at it till twelve at night, shipping of them.

1666-07-01 17:38   Down to Deptford to the yard, thinking to have seen Bagwell’s wife, whose husband is gone yesterday back to the fleet, but I did not see her, so missed what I went for.

1666-07-01 13:58 r Though I do not love Sir W. Pen, yet I find it necessary to keep in with him; his good service at Shearnesse in getting out the fleet being much taken notice of, and reported to the King and Duke, even from the Prince and Duke of Albemarle themselves.

1666-07-01 13:55   While I was hard at it comes Sir W. Pen to town, which I little expected, having invited my Lady and her daughter Pegg to dine with me to-day; which at noon they did, and Sir W. Pen with them: and pretty merry we were.

1666-07-01 10:20   To the office receiving letters, two or three one after another from Sir W. Coventry, and sent as many to him, being full of variety of business and hurry.
