1666-07-08 21:30   I expected to have had news sent me of Knipp’s christening to-day; but, hearing nothing of it, I did not go, though I fear it is but their forgetfulness and so I may disappoint them.

1666-07-08 10:04   To church, wife and Mercer and I, in expectation of hearing some mighty preacher to-day, Mrs. Mary Batelier sending us word so; but it proved our ordinary silly lecturer, which made me merry, and she laughed upon us to see her mistake.

1666-07-08 06:32   Up, and pretty well of my pain, so that it did not trouble me at all, and I do clearly find that my pain in my back was nothing but only accompanied my bruise in my stones.

1666-07-08 06:08   It proved the hottest night that ever I was in in my life, and thundered and lightened all night long and rained hard.

1666-07-08 01:05   Lord! to see in what fears I lay a good while, hearing of a noise of somebody walking in the house: so rung the bell, and it was my maids going to bed. But the fear of being robbed, having so much money in the house, was very great, and is still so, and do much disquiet me.

1666-07-07 17:24   In some pain in my back by some bruise or other I have given myself in my right testicle this morning, and the pain lies there and hath done, and in my back thereupon all this day.

1666-07-07 14:50   Creed tells me he finds all things mighty dull at Court; and that they now begin to lie long in bed; it being, as we suppose, not seemly for them to be found playing and gaming as they used to be.

1666-07-06 17:22   I met with a letter from Bab Allen, to invite me to be god-father to her boy, with Mrs. Williams, which I consented to, but know not the time when it is to be.

1666-07-06 16:29   To Lumbard Streete, and received 2000l, and carried it home: whereof 1000l. in gold. The greatest quantity not only that I ever had of gold, but that ever I saw together, and is not much above half a 100lb. bag full, but is much weightier.

1666-07-06 10:05   It is a pretty thing to observe that a man shall see many women now-a-days of mean sort in the streets, but no men; men being so afeard of the press.

1666-07-06 09:34   To Lumbard Street, about the getting of a good sum of money, thence home, in preparation for my having some good sum in my hands, for fear of a trouble in the State, that I may not have all I have in the world out of my hands and so be left a beggar.

1666-07-05 22:20   I to my office and Lumbard Street about money, and then to my office again, very busy, and so till late, and then a song with my wife and Mercer in the garden, and so with great content to bed.

1666-07-04 20:55 r Sir W. Pen did talk very rationally to me, insomuch that I took more pleasure this night in hearing him discourse, than I ever did in my life in any thing that he said.

1666-07-04 20:28 r In the business of fore-castles, which Sir W. Pen did oppose, all the world sees now the use of them for shelter of men.

1666-07-04 20:12 r 1. That we must fight in a line, whereas we fight promiscuously; 2. We must not desert ships of our own in distress; 3. That ships, when they are a little shattered, must not take the liberty to come in of themselves, but refit themselves the best they can, and stay out.

1666-07-04 20:10   Sir W. Pen come to me, and we walked together, and talked of the late fight. He says three things must remedied, or else we shall be undone by this fleet...

1666-07-04 10:20   To St. James’s, and did our business with the Duke, discoursing about the places where to build ten great ships; the King and Council have resolved on none to be under third-rates; but it is impossible to do it, unless we have more money towards the doing it than yet we have.

1666-07-04 07:05   Thanks be to God, the plague is, as I hear, encreased but two this week; but in the country in several places it rages mightily, and particularly in Colchester, where it hath long been, and is believed will quite depopulate the place.

1666-07-04 00:05   Home and till midnight about settling my last month’s accounts wherein I have been interrupted by public business, that I did not state them two or three days ago, but I do now to my great joy find myself worth above 5600l, for which the Lord’s name be praised!

1666-07-03 20:20   News come yesterday from Harwich, that the Dutch had appeared upon our coast with their fleet, and we believe did go to the Gun-fleete, and they are supposed to be there now.

1666-07-03 16:22 r Mr. Finch told me Mr. Prin’s character; that he is a man of mighty labour and reading and memory, but the worst judge of matters, or layer together of what he hath read, in the world.

1666-07-03 16:03   Mr. Finch, one of the Commissioners, and I walked two hours together in the garden, talking of many things; sometimes of Mr. Povy, whose vanity, prodigality, neglect of his business, and committing it to unfit hands hath undone him and outed him of all his public employments.

1666-07-02 18:32 r With good words, and cajoling the ringleader into the Tower (where, when he was come, he was clapped up in the hole), they were got very quietly; but I think it is much if they do not run the vessel on ground.

1666-07-02 17:37 r I meant to have spoke with Bagwell’s mother, but her face was sore, and so I did not, but returned and upon the water found one of the vessels loaden with the Bridewell birds in a great mutiny, and they would not sail.

1666-07-02 15:48   Down to Deptford; but to see what a consternation there is upon the water by reason of this great press, that nothing is able to get a waterman to appear almost.

1666-07-02 11:04   Like an asse at Paul’s, prating Colonel Cox did take me out of my way on purpose to show me the gate (the little north gate) where he had two men shot close by him on each hand, and his own hair burnt by a bullet-shot in the insurrection of Venner, and himself escaped.

1666-07-02 07:32   Out of curiosity to Bridewell to see the pressed men, where there are about 300; but so unruly that I durst not go among them: and they have reason to be so, having been kept these three days prisoners, with little or no victuals.

1666-07-02 00:08 r Besides, to see poor patient labouring men and housekeepers, leaving poor wives and families, taking up on a sudden by strangers, was very hard, and that without press-money, but forced against all law to be gone. It is a great tyranny.

1666-07-02 00:05 r Lord! how some poor women did cry; and in my life I never did see such natural expression of passion as I did here in some women’s bewailing themselves, and running to every parcel of men that were brought to look for their husbands, that it grieved me to the heart to hear them.

1666-07-02 00:03   Back to the Tower several times, about the business of the pressed men, and late at it till twelve at night, shipping of them.

1666-07-01 17:38   Down to Deptford to the yard, thinking to have seen Bagwell’s wife, whose husband is gone yesterday back to the fleet, but I did not see her, so missed what I went for.

1666-07-01 13:58 r Though I do not love Sir W. Pen, yet I find it necessary to keep in with him; his good service at Shearnesse in getting out the fleet being much taken notice of, and reported to the King and Duke, even from the Prince and Duke of Albemarle themselves.

1666-07-01 13:55   While I was hard at it comes Sir W. Pen to town, which I little expected, having invited my Lady and her daughter Pegg to dine with me to-day; which at noon they did, and Sir W. Pen with them: and pretty merry we were.

1666-07-01 10:20   To the office receiving letters, two or three one after another from Sir W. Coventry, and sent as many to him, being full of variety of business and hurry.
