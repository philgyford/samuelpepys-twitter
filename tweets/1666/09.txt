1666-09-30 21:45   This month ends with my mind full of business and concernment how this office will speed with the Parliament, which begins to be mighty severe in the examining our accounts, and the expence of the Navy this war.

1666-09-30 09:15   I saw Mercer come into the church, which I had a mind to, but she avoided looking up, which vexed me.

1666-09-30 09:10   The church infinitely thronged with strangers since the fire come into our parish; but not one handsome face in all of them, as if, indeed, there was a curse, as Bishop Fuller heretofore said, upon our parish.

1666-09-29 22:15   I to my wife, who staid for the finishing her new best gowne (the best that ever he made her) coloured tabby, flowered, and so took it and her home.

1666-09-29 21:39   Sir W. Coventry and I find to our great joy that wages, victuals, wear and tear, cast by the medium of the men, will come to above 3000000; and that the extraordinaries will arise to more than will justify the expence we have declared to have been at since the war, viz, 320000l.

1666-09-29 20:58   To the office again, and then got done by night the lists that are to be presented to the Parliament Committee of the ships, number of men, and time employed since the war, and then I with it (leaving my wife at Unthanke’s) to St. James’s.

1666-09-29 10:50   Sir W. Warren, Sir W. Pen and I talked of our Scotch motion, which Sir W. Warren did seem to be stumbled at, and did give no answer. We were parted without coming to any good resolution, I discerning that Sir W. Warren had no mind to it, but that he was surprised at our motion.

1666-09-28 21:57   I discoursed with W. Hewer about Mercer, having a great mind she should come to us again, and instructed him what to say to her mother about it.

1666-09-28 21:20   Sir W. Pen and I a turn in the garden, and he broke to me a proposition of his and my joining in a design of fetching timber and deals from Scotland, by the help of Mr. Pett upon the place; which, while London is building, will yield good money.

1666-09-28 09:10   By and by the glazier comes to finish the windows of my house, which pleases me, and the bookbinder to gild the backs of my books. I got the glass of my book-presses to be done presently, which did mightily content me.

1666-09-28 07:04   I am come to agreement with my wife to have Mercer again, on condition she may learn this winter two months to dance, and she promises me she will endeavour to learn to sing, and all this I am willing enough to.

1666-09-27 21:42   No news of the fleet yet, but that they went by Dover on the 25th towards the Gunfleet, but whether the Dutch be yet abroad, or no, we hear not. De Ruyter is not dead, but like to do well.

1666-09-27 20:04   I have this evening discoursed with W. Hewer about Mercer, I having a mind to have her again; and I am vexed to hear him say that she hath no mind to come again, though her mother hath.

1666-09-27 10:40   To the Exchequer, and spoke to Mr. Falconbridge about his girl I heard sing at Nonsuch, and he sent for the girl, and she hath a pretty way of singing, but hath almost forgot for want of practice. She is poor in clothes and not bred to any carriage, but will be soon taught all.

1666-09-27 09:03   I to look out Penny, my tailor, to speak for a cloak and cassock for my brother, who is coming to town; and I will have him in a canonical dress, that he may be the fitter to go abroad with me.

1666-09-27 06:31   A very furious blowing night all the night; and my mind still mightily perplexed with dreams, and burning the rest of the town, and waking in much pain for the fleet.

1666-09-26 21:18   I to Sir W. Batten, and there hear our business was tendered to the House to-day, and a Committee of the whole House chosen to examine our accounts, and a great many Hotspurs enquiring into it, and likely to give us much trouble and blame.

1666-09-26 20:40   Away by coach, and called away my wife at Unthanke’s, where she tells me she hath bought a gowne of 15s. per yard; the same, before her face, my Lady Castlemayne this day bought also, which I seemed vexed for, though I do not grudge it her.

1666-09-26 19:22 r I met with good Mr. Evelyn, who cries out against it, and calls it bitchering, for the Duke of York talks a little to her, and then she goes away, and then he follows her again like a dog.

1666-09-26 19:10   I went into the dining-room and saw several fine ladies; among others, Castlemayne, but chiefly Denham again; and the Duke of York taking her aside and talking to her in the sight of all the world, all alone; which was strange, and what also I did not like.

1666-09-26 17:52 r And Mr. Crumlum all his books and household stuff burned; they trusting St. Fayth’s, and the roof of the church falling, broke the arch down into the lower church, and so all the goods burned. A very great loss.

1666-09-26 17:49   I to White Hall waiting all day on the Duke of York. By Mr. Dugdale I hear the great loss of books in St. Paul’s Church-yard, and at their Hall also, which they value about 150000l; some booksellers being wholly undone, among others, they say, my poor Kirton.

1666-09-26 11:32   I away by coach to White Hall, and after a few turns, and hearing that our accounts come into the House but to-day, being hindered yesterday by other business, I away by coach home.

1666-09-26 06:15   All night still mightily troubled in my sleep, with fire and houses pulling down.

1666-09-25 10:15   I walked in the Hall, and among others with Ned Pickering, who continues still a lying, bragging coxcomb, telling me that my Lord Sandwich may thank himself for all his misfortune.

1666-09-25 09:32   I had brought my wife to White Hall, and leaving her with Mrs. Michell, where she sat in her shop and had burnt wine sent for her.

1666-09-25 09:14   With all my people to get the letter writ over, and other things done, which I did, and by coach to Lord Bruncker’s, and got his hand to it; and then to the Parliament House and got it signed by the rest, and then delivered it at the House-door to Sir Philip Warwicke.

1666-09-24 19:37 r At last, I concluded of scraping out my name and putting in Mr. Tooker’s, which eased me; though the price was such as I should have had glory by.

1666-09-24 19:20   Looking over the book that Sir G. Carteret intends to deliver to the Parliament of his payments since September 1st, 1664, and there I find my name the very second for flags, which I had bought for the Navy, of calico; once, about 500 and odd pounds, which vexed me mightily.

1666-09-23 17:10 r Here happened a pretty question of Sir W. Coventry, whether this account of ours will not put my Lord Treasurer to a difficulty to tell what is become of all the money the Parliament have given in this time for the war, which hath amounted to about 4000000l.

1666-09-23 16:45   At Sir G. Carteret’s lodgings Sir W. Coventry met, and we did debate the whole business of our accounts to the Parliament; where it appears to us that the charge of the war from September 1st, 1664, to this Michaelmas, will have been but 3200000l.

1666-09-23 13:57   Mr. Wayth and I eat a bit of victuals in my old closet, now my little dining-room, which makes a pretty room, and my house being so clean makes me mightily pleased, but only I do lacke Mercer or somebody in the house to sing with.

1666-09-22 21:15   Writ for brother John to come to town. Among other reasons, my estate lying in money, I am afeard of any sudden miscarriage.

1666-09-22 16:07   Comes Anthony Joyce to see me, and with tears told me his loss, but yet that he had something left that he can live well upon, and I doubt it not. But he would buy some place that he could have and yet keepe his trade where he is settled in St. Jones’s.

1666-09-22 10:54   My Lord Bruncker do now give me a watch, a plain one, in the room of my former watch with many motions which I did give him. If it goes well, I care not for the difference in worth, though believe there is above 5l.

1666-09-22 08:42 r But with, I believe, about 20l. cost one way or other besides about 20l. charge in removing my goods, and do not find that I have lost any thing but two little pictures of ship and sea, and a little gold frame for one of my sea-cards.

1666-09-22 08:39   To my closet, and had it new washed, and now my house is so clean as I never saw it, or any other house in my life, and every thing in as good condition as ever before the fire.

1666-09-21 23:02   I home, and there, with great pleasure, very late new setting all my books; and now I am in as good condition as I desire to be in all worldly respects. The Lord of Heaven make me thankful, and continue me therein!

1666-09-21 11:04 r I sent for Harry, and he tells me it is so, and brought me by and by my hamper of books to my great joy, with the same books I missed, and three more great ones, and no more.

1666-09-21 08:20   W. Hewer tells me that upon enquiry he do find that Sir W. Pen hath a hamper more than his own, which he took for a hamper of bottles of wine, and are books in it.

1666-09-21 01:02   Very late up with Jane setting my books in perfect order in my closet, but am mightily troubled for my great books that I miss, and I am troubled the more for fear there should be more missing than what I find.

1666-09-20 16:04   Out by coach, my wife with me, which we have not done several weeks now, through all the ruines, to show her them, which frets her much, and is a sad sight indeed.

1666-09-20 11:10   News is come that De Ruyter is dead, or very near it, of a hurt in his mouth, upon the discharge of one of his own guns; which put him into a fever, and he likely to die, if not already dead.

1666-09-20 06:30   Up, much troubled about my books, but cannot imagine where they should be.

1666-09-20 02:06 r Two little pictures of sea and ships and a little gilt frame belonging to my plate of the River, I want; but my books do heartily trouble me. Most of my gilt frames are hurt, which also troubles me, but most my books.

1666-09-20 02:03 r Speed’s Chronicle and Maps, and the two parts of Waggoner, and a book of cards, which I suppose I have put up with too much care, that I have forgot where they are; for sure they are not stole.

1666-09-20 02:00   I and the boy to finish and set up my books, and everything else in my house, and then to bed; but mightily troubled at my missing four or five of my biggest books.

1666-09-19 20:22   To Deptford and got all my pictures put into wherries, and my other fine things, and landed them all very well, and brought them home, and got Sympson to set them all up.

1666-09-19 09:24   With Sir W. Pen by coach to St. James’s, and there did our usual business before the Duke of York; which signified little, our business being only complaints of lack of money.

1666-09-18 20:04   Betimes to bed, my wife also being all this day ill in the same manner. Troubled at my wife’s hair coming off so much.

1666-09-18 10:20   Soon as up I begun to have some pain in my bladder and belly, as usual, which made me go to dinner betimes, to fill my belly, and that did ease me.

1666-09-18 06:50   Strange with what freedom and quantity I pissed this night, which I know not what to impute to but my oysters, unless the coldness of the night should cause it, for it was a sad rainy and tempestuous night.

1666-09-17 22:16   I weary, my wife and I, and Balty and his wife, who come hither to-day to help us, to a barrel of oysters I sent from the river today, and so to bed.

1666-09-17 21:20   All the day with Harman and his people finishing the hangings and beds in my house, and the hangings will be as good as ever, and particularly in my new closet.

1666-09-17 07:38   By water, seeing the City all the way, a sad sight indeed, much fire being still in.

1666-09-17 05:14   Up betimes, and shaved myself after a week’s growth, but, Lord! how ugly I was yesterday and how fine to-day!

1666-09-16 13:20   With my wife, against her will, all undressed and dirty, dined at Sir W. Pen’s, where was all the company of our families in town; but, Lord! so sorry a dinner: venison baked in pans, that the dinner I have had for his lady alone hath been worth four of it.

1666-09-15 23:21   I home to bed; and find to my infinite joy many rooms clean; and myself and wife lie in our own chamber again. But much terrified in the nights now-a-days with dreams of fire, and falling down of houses.

1666-09-15 23:04   While my people were busy, I wrote near thirty letters and orders with my own hand. It is strange to see how clear my head was, being eased of all the matter of all these letters; whereas one would think that I should have been dazed.

1666-09-15 19:20 r He says that the French, as late in the year as it is, are coming; that the Dutch are really in bad condition, but that this unhappinesse of ours do give them heart.

1666-09-15 19:07   Captain Coke says he hath computed that the rents of houses lost by this fire in the City comes to 600,000l. per annum; that this will make the Parliament more quiet than otherwise they would have been.

1666-09-15 11:58   All the morning at the office, Harman being come to my great satisfaction to put up my beds and hangings, so I am at rest.

1666-09-14 22:10   So to bed as last night, only my wife and I upon a bedstead with curtains in that which was Mercer’s chamber, and Balty and his wife (who are here and do us good service), where we lay last night.

1666-09-14 21:05   This day, poor Tom Pepys, the turner, was with me, and Kate Joyce, to bespeak places; one for himself, the other for her husband. She tells me he hath lost 140l. per annum, but hath seven houses left.

1666-09-14 17:35   I also got my wine out of the ground again, and set in my cellar; but with great pain to keep the porters that carried it in from observing the money-chests there.

1666-09-14 17:31   All the afternoon busy; and Sir W. Coventry come to me, and found me, as God would have it, in my office, and people about me setting my papers to rights.

1666-09-14 10:47   I was troubled in being at home, to see all my goods lie up and down the house in a bad condition, and strange workmen going to and fro might take what they would almost.

1666-09-14 08:10   Up, and to work, having carpenters come to help in setting up bedsteads and hangings; and at that trade my people and I all the morning.

1666-09-13 22:02   After supper to bed in my house, the first time I have lain there; and lay with my wife in my old closet upon the ground, and Balty and his wife in the best chamber, upon the ground also.

1666-09-13 16:31   So to Sir G. Carteret’s to work, and there did to my content ship off into the Bezan all the rest of my goods, saving my pictures and fine things, that I will bring home in wherrys when the house is fit to receive them.

1666-09-13 13:04   So down to Deptford again to fetch the rest, and there eat a bit of dinner at the Globe, with the master of the Bezan with me, while the labourers went to dinner. Here I hear that this poor town do bury still of the plague seven or eight in a day.

1666-09-13 08:07   Down to Tower Wharfe; and there, with Balty and labourers from Deptford, did get my goods housed well at home.

1666-09-12 22:30 r Taking occasion from the uncertainty of su marido’s return esta noche, did me levar, and so away home late to Sir W. Pen’s (Balty and his wife lying at my house).

1666-09-12 21:55   I found occasion to return in the dark and to Bagwell, and there nudo in lecto con ella did do all that I desired, but though I did intend para aver demorado con elle toda la night, yet when I had done ce que je voudrais I did hate both ella and la cosa.

1666-09-12 16:03   I took Balty down with me to Deptford, and there by the Bezan loaded above half my goods and sent them away.

1666-09-12 12:10   To Martin, and there did tout ce que je voudrais avec her, and drank, and away by water home and to dinner, Balty and his wife there.

1666-09-11 22:04   I home, and with Mr. Hater, Gibson, and Tom alone, got all my chests and money into the further cellar with much pains, but great content to me when done.

1666-09-11 20:12   At Sir W. Pen’s, with my wife, at supper, he in a mad, ridiculous, drunken humour; and it seems there have been some late distances between his lady and him, as my wife tells me.

1666-09-11 15:30   I down to Deptford and there spoke with Bagwell and agreed upon to-morrow, and come home in the rain by water.

1666-09-11 06:10   Up betimes, and by water with my gold, and laid it with the rest in my office, where I find all well and safe.

1666-09-10 20:50   So down to Woolwich, and there find my wife out of humour and indifferent, as she uses upon her having much liberty abroad.

1666-09-10 19:15   By and by comes brother Balty from sea, which I was glad of; and so got him, and Mr. Tooker, and the boy, to watch with them all in the office all night, while I went down to my wife, calling at Deptford, intending to see Bagwell, but did not ouvrir la porta como yo did expect.

1666-09-10 16:34 r Took a hackney-coach myself (the hackney-coaches now standing at Allgate). Much wealth indeed there is at his house. Blessed be God, I got all mine well thence, and lodged it in my office; but vexed to have all the world see it.

1666-09-10 13:22   I hear that Sir W. Rider says that the town is full of the report of the wealth that is in his house, and would be glad that his friends would provide for the safety of their goods there.

1666-09-10 11:57   All the morning clearing our cellars, and breaking in pieces all my old lumber, to make room, and to prevent fire.

1666-09-09 20:30 r To my office, there to write down my journall, and take leave of my brother, whom I sent back this afternoon, though rainy; which it hath not done a good while before. I was troubled for him, though it is good for the fyre.

1666-09-09 15:20 r To church again, and there preached Dean Harding; but, methinks, a bad, poor sermon, though proper for the time; nor eloquent, in saying at this time that the City is reduced from a large folio to a decimo tertio.

1666-09-09 09:20 r I to church, where our parson made a melancholy but good sermon; and many and most in the church cried, specially the women. The church mighty full; but few of fashion, and most strangers.

1666-09-08 23:57 r I was much frighted and kept awake in my bed, by some noise I heard a great while below stairs; and the boys not coming up to me when I knocked. It was by their discovery of people stealing of some neighbours’ wine that lay in vessels in the streets.

1666-09-08 17:53 r To Bednall Green by coach, my brother with me, and saw all well there, and fetched away my journall book to enter for five days past, and then back to the office where I find Bagwell’s wife, and her husband come home.

1666-09-08 14:10 r Alderman Starling, a very rich man, the fire at next door to him in our lane, after our men had saved his house, did give 2s. 6d. among thirty of them, and did quarrel with some that would remove the rubbish out of the way of the fire, saying that they come to steal.

1666-09-08 13:53 r Much good discourse; among others, of the low spirits of some rich men in the City, in sparing any encouragement to the poor people that wrought for the saving their houses.

1666-09-08 13:47 r To Sir W. Batten’s, and took my brother with me, and there dined with a great company of neighbours.

1666-09-08 12:20 r I met with many people undone, and more that have extraordinary great losses. People speaking their thoughts variously about the beginning of the fire, and the rebuilding of the City.

1666-09-08 11:39 r To Gresham College; where infinity of people, partly through novelty to see the new place, and partly to find out and hear what is become one man of another.

1666-09-08 10:50 r To the Cockpit, whither the Duke of Albemarle is come. It seems the King holds him so necessary at this time that he hath sent for him. Indeed, his interest in the City, being acquainted, and his care in keeping things quiet, is reckoned that wherein he will be very serviceable.

1666-09-08 09:38 r The fleet is at Portsmouth, there staying a wind to carry them to the Downes, or towards Bullen, where they say the Dutch fleete is gone, and stays.

1666-09-08 09:03 r To St. James’s, where we met first at Sir W. Coventry’s chamber, and there did what business we can, without any books. Our discourse, as every thing else, was confused.

1666-09-07 22:38 r I home to Sir W. Pen’s, who did give me a bed; but without curtains or hangings, all being down. So here I went the first time into a naked bed, only my drawers on.

1666-09-07 20:27 r A proclamation is come out for markets to be kept at Leadenhall and Mile-end greene, and several other places about the town; and Tower-hill, and all churches to be set open to receive poor people.

1666-09-07 20:04 r This day our Merchants first met at Gresham College, which, by proclamation, is to be their Exchange.

1666-09-07 17:52 r People do all the world over cry out of the simplicity of my Lord Mayor in general; and more particularly in this business of the fire, laying it all upon him.

1666-09-07 16:56 r Much dispute where the Custome-house shall be thereby the growth of the City again to be foreseen. My Lord Treasurer, they say, and others; would have it at the other end of the town.

1666-09-07 16:20 r Strange to hear what is bid for houses all up and down here; a friend of Sir W. Rider’s: having 150l. for what he used to let for 40l. per annum.

1666-09-07 13:28 r Down to Woolwich, and there find all well. Dined, and Mrs. Markham come to see my wife.

1666-09-07 11:36 r Home, and did give orders for my house to be made clean.

1666-09-07 10:48 r My Lord Bruncker tells us the Generall is sent for up, to come to advise with the King about business at this juncture, and to keep all quiet; which is great honour to him, but I am sure is but a piece of dissimulation.

1666-09-07 09:29 r Our fleetes, he tells me, have been in sight one of another, and most unhappily by fowle weather were parted, to our great loss, as in reason they do conclude; the Dutch being come out only to make a show.

1666-09-07 09:13 r Sir W. Coventry hopes we shall have no public distractions upon this fire, which is what every body fears, because of the talk of the French having a hand in it.

1666-09-07 08:50 r To Sir W. Coventry, at St. James’s, who lay without curtains, having removed all his goods; as the King at White Hall, and every body had done, and was doing.

1666-09-07 07:40 r To Creed’s lodging, near the New Exchange, and there find him laid down upon a bed; the house all unfurnished, there being fears of the fire’s coming to them. There borrowed a shirt of him, and washed.

1666-09-07 06:30 r To Paul’s Wharfe. I saw all the town burned, and a miserable sight of Paul’s church, with all the roofs fallen, and the body of the quire fallen into St. Fayth’s. Paul’s school also, Ludgate, and Fleet-street, my father’s house, and the church, and a good part of the Temple.

1666-09-07 05:04 r I slept with the office full of labourers, who talked, and slept, and walked all night long there.

1666-09-06 20:40 r I home, and to Sir W. Batten’s, and there with Sir R. Ford, Mr. Knightly, and one Withers, a professed lying rogue, supped well, and mighty merry, and our fears over.

1666-09-06 19:34 r Strange it was to see Cloathworkers’ Hall on fire these three days and nights in one body of flame, it being the cellar full of oyle.

1666-09-06 15:26 r Down to Deptford, and there with great satisfaction landed all my goods at Sir G. Carteret’s safe, and nothing missed I could see, or hurt.

1666-09-06 12:38 r I did go with Sir W. Batten, and our neighbour, Knightly, to Sir R. Ford’s, and there dined in an earthen platter — a fried breast of mutton; a great many of us, but very merry, and indeed as good a meal, though as ugly a one, as ever I had in my life.

1666-09-06 10:37 r To the Swan, and there was trimmed; and then to White Hall, but saw nobody; and so home.

1666-09-06 09:02 r I over to Southwarke, and took boat on the other side the bridge, and so to Westminster, thinking to shift myself, being all in dirt from top to bottom; but could not there find any place to buy a shirt or pair of gloves, Westminster Hall being full of people’s goods.

1666-09-06 07:04 r It was pretty to see how hard the women did work in the cannells, sweeping of water; but then they would scold for drink, and be as drunk as devils. I saw good butts of sugar broke open in the street, and people go and take handsfull out, and put into beer, and drink it.

1666-09-06 05:20 r I met Mr. Gawden at the gate of the office to call our men to Bishop’s-gate, where no fire had yet been near, and there is now one broke out which did give great grounds to people, and to me too, to think that there is some kind of plot in this.

1666-09-05 21:04 r So home, and find there good hopes of saving our office; but great endeavours of watching all night, and having men ready; and so we lodged them in the office, and had drink and bread and cheese for them.

1666-09-05 17:50 r I took up a piece of glass of Mercers’ Chappell in the street, where much more was, so melted and buckled with the heat of the fire like parchment.

1666-09-05 17:19 r Homeward, having passed through Cheapside and Newgate Market, all burned, and seen Anthony Joyce’s house in fire.

1666-09-05 16:10 r Walked into Moorefields (our feet ready to burn, walking through the town among the hot coles), and find that full of people, and poor wretches carrying their goods there, and every body keeping his goods together; drank there, and paid twopence for a plain penny loaf.

1666-09-05 15:28 r I did see a poor cat taken out of a hole in the chimney, joyning to the wall of the Exchange; with, the hair all burned off the body, and yet alive.

1666-09-05 15:03 r The Exchange a sad sight, nothing standing there, of all the statues or pillars, but Sir Thomas Gresham’s picture in the corner.

1666-09-05 14:40 r Mr. Young and Whistler and I walked into the town, and find Fanchurch-street, Gracious-street, and Lumbard-street all in dust.

1666-09-05 12:15 r To Sir W. Pen’s, and there eat a piece of cold meat, having eaten nothing since Sunday, but the remains of Sunday’s dinner.

1666-09-05 10:22 r I up to the top of Barkeing steeple, and there saw the saddest sight of desolation that I ever saw; every where great fires, oyle-cellars, and brimstone, and other things burning.

1666-09-05 09:34 r I find by the blowing up of houses, and the great help given by the workmen out of the King’s yards, there is a good stop given to it, as well as at Marke-lane end as ours; it having only burned the dyall of Barking Church, and part of the porch, and was there quenched.

1666-09-05 08:03 r But to the fyre, and there find greater hopes than I expected; for my confidence of finding our Office on fire was such, that I durst not ask any body how it was with us, till I come and saw it not burned.

1666-09-05 06:57 r Home; and whereas I expected to have seen our house on fire, it was not.

1666-09-05 05:22 r I got the gates open, and to Mr. Shelden’s, where I locked up my gold, and charged my wife and W. Hewer never to leave the room without one of them in it, night, or day.

1666-09-05 04:29 r There, when I come, I find the gates shut, but no guard kept at all, which troubled me, because of discourse now begun, that there is plot in it, and that the French had done it.

1666-09-05 03:55 r But, Lord! what sad sight it was by moon-light to see the whole City almost on fire, that you might see it plain at Woolwich, as if you were by it.

1666-09-05 03:10 r I up, and finding it so, resolved presently to take my wife away, and did, and took my gold, which was about 2350l, W. Hewer, and Jane, down by Proundy’s boat to Woolwich.

1666-09-05 02:04 r My wife calls me up and tells me of new cryes of fire, it being come to Barkeing Church, which is the bottom of our lane.

1666-09-04 23:10 r I lay down in the office again upon W. Hewer’s quilt, being mighty weary, and sore in my feet with going till I was hardly able to stand.

1666-09-04 22:49 r I wrote to my father, but the post-house being burned, the letter could not go.

1666-09-04 22:36 r W. Hewer went to see how his mother did, and comes home, telling us he hath been forced to remove her to Islington, her house in Pye-corner being burned; the fire is got so far that way, and the Old Bayly and was running down to Fleete-streete; and Paul’s is burned and Cheapside.

1666-09-04 22:10 r Now begins the practice of blowing up of houses in Tower-street, those next the Tower, which at first did frighten people more than anything, but it stopped the fire where it was done, it bringing down the houses to the ground in the same places they stood.

1666-09-04 21:49 r I walked in the dark down to Tower-street, and there saw it all on fire, at the Trinity House on that side, and the Dolphin Tavern on this side, which was very near us; and the fire with extraordinary vehemence.

1666-09-04 21:15 r Walking into the garden, and saw how horridly the sky looks, all on a fire in the night, was enough to put us out of our wits; and, indeed, it was extremely dreadful, for it looks just as if it was at us; and the whole heaven on fire.

1666-09-04 20:28 r Mrs. Turner and her husband supped with my wife and I, in the office, upon a shoulder of mutton from the cook’s, without any napkin or any thing, in a sad manner, but were merry.

1666-09-04 18:38 r Sir W. Pen and I did dig another pit, and put our wine in it; and I my Parmazan cheese, as well as my wine and some other things.

1666-09-04 16:03 r Thinking of the burning of this office I did propose for the sending up of our workmen from Woolwich and Deptford yards and to write to Sir W. Coventry to have the Duke of York’s permission to pull down houses rather than lose this office, which would hinder the King’s business.

1666-09-04 10:50 r Sir W. Batten not knowing how to remove his wine, did dig a pit in the garden, and laid it in there; and I took the opportunity of laying all the papers of my office that I could not otherwise dispose of.

1666-09-04 08:20 r Sir W. Pen and I to Tower-street, and there met the fire burning three or four doors beyond Mr. Howell’s, whose goods, poor man, his trayes, and dishes, shovells, &c., were flung all along Tower-street in the kennels.

1666-09-04 05:34 r Up by break of day to get away the remainder of my things; which I did by a lighter at the Iron gate.

1666-09-03 21:08 r After me my poor wife did the like, we having fed upon the remains of yesterday’s dinner, having no fire nor dishes, nor any opportunity of dressing any thing.

1666-09-03 20:03 r Lay down a little upon a quilt of W. Hewer’s in the office, all my own things being packed up or gone.

1666-09-03 16:12 r The Duke of York came by the office, and spoke to us, and did ride with his guard up and down the City, to keep all quiet (he being now General, and having the care of all).

1666-09-03 10:32 r And here was my neighbour’s wife, with her pretty child, and some few of her things, which I did willingly give way to be saved with mine; but there was no passing with any thing through the postern, the crowd was so great.

1666-09-03 09:40 r My wife and I and all my people labouring to get away the rest of our things, and did get Mr. Tooker to get me a lighter to take them in, and we did carry them over Tower Hill, which was by this time full of people’s goods, bringing their goods thither; and down to the lighter.

1666-09-03 07:09 r Home, with much ado to find a way, nor any sleep all this night to me nor my poor wife.

1666-09-03 05:32 r I find Sir W. Rider tired with being called up all night, and receiving things from several friends. His house full of goods, and much of Sir W. Batten’s and Sir W. Pen’s.

1666-09-03 05:03 r Lord! to see how the streets and the highways are crowded with people running and riding, and getting of carts at any rate to fetch away things.

1666-09-03 04:44 r My Lady Batten sent me a cart to carry away all my money, and plate, and best things, to Sir W. Rider’s at Bednall-greene. Which I did riding myself in my night-gown in the cart.

1666-09-02 22:30 r Mr. Hater and I did remove my money and iron chests into my cellar, as thinking that the safest place. And got my bags of gold into my office, ready to carry away, and my chief papers of accounts also there, and my tallies into a box by themselves.

1666-09-02 21:57 r The noise coming every moment of the growth of the fire; so as we were forced to begin to pack up our own goods; and prepare for their removal; and did by moonshine (it being brave dry, and moon shine, and warm weather) carry much of my goods into the garden.

1666-09-02 21:18 r So home with a sad heart, and there find every body discoursing and lamenting the fire; and poor Tom Hater come with some few of his goods saved out of his house, which is burned upon Fish-street Hill.

1666-09-02 20:52 r The churches, houses, and all on fire and flaming at once; and a horrid noise the flames made, and the cracking of houses at their ruins.

1666-09-02 20:37 r We staid till, it being darkish, we saw the fire as only one entire arch of fire from this to the other side the bridge, and in a bow up the hill for an arch of above a mile long: it made me weep to see it.

1666-09-02 20:28 r As it grew darker, the fire appeared more and more, and in corners and upon steeples, and between churches and houses, as far as we could see up the hill of the City, in a most horrid malicious bloody flame, not like the fine flame of an ordinary fire.

1666-09-02 20:15 r We to a little ale-house on the Bankside, over against the Three Cranes, and there staid till it was dark almost, and saw the fire grow.

1666-09-02 17:15 r So near the fire as we could for smoke; and all over the Thames, with one’s face in the wind, you were almost burned with a shower of firedrops. This is very true; so as houses were burned by these drops of fire, three or four, nay, five or six houses, one from another.

1666-09-02 16:49 r The River full of lighters and boats taking in goods, and good goods swimming in the water, and only I observed that hardly one lighter or boat in three that had the goods of a house in, but there was a pair of Virginalls in it.

1666-09-02 16:20 r Good hopes there was of stopping the fire at the Three Cranes above, and at Buttolph’s Wharf below bridge, if care be used; but the wind carries it into the City so as we know not by the water-side what it do there.

1666-09-02 15:38 r Met with the King and Duke of York in their barge, and with them to Queenhith and there called Sir Richard Browne to them. Their order was only to pull down houses apace, and so below bridge the water-side; but little was or could be done, the fire coming upon them so fast.

1666-09-02 14:40 r I to Paul’s Wharf, where I had appointed a boat to attend me, and took in Mr. Carcasse and his brother, whom I met in the streets and carried them below and above bridge to see the fire, which was now got further, both below and above and no likelihood of stopping it.

1666-09-02 13:52 r I and Moone away, and walked, through the City, the streets full of nothing but people and horses and carts loaden with goods, ready to run over one another, and, removing goods from one burned house to another.

1666-09-02 13:03 r Mrs. Batelier come to enquire after Mr. Woolfe and Stanes (who, it seems, are related to them), whose houses in Fish-street are all burned; and they in a sad condition. She would not stay in the fright.

1666-09-02 12:58 r We were in great trouble and disturbance at this fire, not knowing what to think of it. However, we had an extraordinary good dinner, and as merry, as at this time we could be.

1666-09-02 12:12 r Home, and there find my guests, which was Mr. Wood and his wife Barbary Sheldon, and also Mr. Moone: she mighty fine, and her husband; for aught I see, a likely man.

1666-09-02 12:07 r I saw Mr. Isaake Houblon, prettily dressed and dirty, at his door at Dowgate, receiving some of his brothers’ things, whose houses were on fire; and, as he says, have been removed twice already; and he doubts that they must be in a little time removed from his house also.

1666-09-02 12:04 r I walked home, seeing people all almost distracted, and no manner of means used to quench the fire. The houses, too, so very thick thereabouts, and full of matter for burning, as pitch and tar, in Thames-street; and warehouses of oyle, and wines, and brandy, and other things.

1666-09-02 11:45 r Met my Lord Mayor in Canning Street, like a man spent, with a handkercher about his neck. He cried, like a fainting woman, “Lord! what can I do? I am spent: people will not obey me. I have been pulling down houses; but the fire overtakes us faster than we can do it.”

1666-09-02 11:32 r Meeting with Captain Cocke, I in his coach, which he lent me, and Creed with me to Paul’s, and there walked along Watling-street, as well as I could, every creature coming away loaden with goods to save, and here and there sick people carried away in beds.

1666-09-02 10:58 r The Duke of York bid me tell him that if he would have any more soldiers he shall; and so did my Lord Arlington afterwards, as a great secret.

1666-09-02 10:52 r They seemed much troubled, and the King commanded me to go to my Lord Mayor from him, and command him to spare no houses, but to pull down before the fire every way.

1666-09-02 10:40 r So I was called for, and did tell the King and Duke of York what I saw, and that unless his Majesty did command houses to be pulled down nothing could stop the fire.

1666-09-02 10:26 r To White Hall, and there up to the Kings closet in the Chappel, where people come about me, and did give them an account dismayed them all, and word was carried in to the King.

1666-09-02 09:53 r Every thing, after so long a drought, proving combustible, even the very stones of churches, and among other things the poor steeple whereof my old school-fellow Elborough is parson, taken fire in the very top, an there burned till it fell down.

1666-09-02 09:50 r Nobody, to my sight, endeavouring to quench the fire, but to remove their goods, and leave all to the fire, and having seen it get as far as the Steele-yard, and the wind mighty high and driving it into the City.

1666-09-02 08:52 r Among other things, the poor pigeons, I perceive, were loth to leave their houses, but hovered about the windows and balconys till they were, some of them burned, their wings, and fell down.

1666-09-02 08:48 r Everybody endeavouring to remove their goods, and flinging into the river or bringing them into lighters that lay off; poor people staying in their houses as long as till the very fire touched them, and then running into boats, or clambering from one pair of stairs to another.

1666-09-02 08:45 r So I down to the water-side, and there got a boat and through bridge, and there saw a lamentable fire. Poor Michell’s house, as far as the Old Swan, already burned, and the fire running further, that in a very little time it got as far as the Stillyard, while I was there.

1666-09-02 08:20 r Down, with my heart full of trouble, to the Lieutenant of the Tower, who tells me that it begun this morning in the King’s baker’s house in Pudding-lane, and that it hath burned St. Magnus’s Church and most part of Fish-street already.

1666-09-02 08:00 r I walked to the Tower, and there got up upon one of the high places, Sir J. Robinson’s little son going up with me; and there I did see the houses at that end of the bridge all on fire, and an infinite great fire on this and the other side the end of the bridge.

1666-09-02 07:45 r Jane comes and tells me that she hears that above 300 houses have been burned down to-night by the fire we saw, and that it is now burning down all Fish-street, by London Bridge.

1666-09-02 07:12 r I rose again to dress myself, and there looked out at the window, and saw the fire not so much as it was and further off. So to my closet to set things to rights after yesterday’s cleaning.

1666-09-02 03:22 r I rose and slipped on my nightgown, and went to her window, and thought it to be on the backside of Marke-lane at the farthest; but, being unused to such fires as fallowed, I thought it far enough off; and so went to bed again.

1666-09-02 03:03   Some of our maids sitting up late to get things ready against our feast to-day, Jane called us up to tell us of a great fire they saw in the City.

1666-09-01 22:10   We to Islington, and there eat and drank and mighty merry; and so home singing, and, after a letter or two at the office, to bed.

1666-09-01 15:05   Sir W. Pen and my wife and Mercer and I to “Polichinelly,” but were there horribly frighted to see Young Killigrew come in with a great many more young sparks; but we hid ourselves, so as we think they did not see us.
