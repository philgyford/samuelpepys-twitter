1666-12-31 23:57 r One thing I reckon remarkable in my owne condition is, that I am come to abound in good plate, so as at all entertainments to be served wholly with silver plates, having two dozen and a half.

1666-12-31 23:54 r A sad, vicious, negligent Court, and all sober men there fearful of the ruin of the whole kingdom this next year; from which, good God deliver us!

1666-12-31 23:51 r The Parliament backward in raising, because jealous of the spending of the money; the City less and less likely to be built again, every body settling elsewhere, and nobody encouraged to trade.

1666-12-31 23:48 r Public matters in a most sad condition; seamen discouraged for want of pay, and are become not to be governed: nor, as matters are now, can any fleet go out next year. Our enemies, French and Dutch, great, and grow more by our poverty.

1666-12-31 23:43 r Myself and family well, having four maids and one clerk, Tom, in my house, and my brother, now with me, to spend time in order to his preferment. Our healths all well, only my eyes with overworking them are sore as candlelight comes to them, and not else.

1666-12-31 23:40   Thus ends this year of public wonder and mischief to this nation, and, therefore, generally wished by all people to have an end.

1666-12-31 21:21 r The doing of this, and entering of it fair, with the sorting of all my expenses, to see how and in what points I have exceeded, did make it late work, till my eyes become very sore and ill, and then did give over.

1666-12-31 21:18 r Yet, blessed be God! and I pray God make me thankful for it, I do find myself worth in money, all good, above 6,200l.; which is above 1800l. more than I was the last year. This, I trust in God, will make me thankfull for what I have.

1666-12-31 21:15 r And then again my spendings this year have exceeded my spendings the last by 644l.: my whole spendings last year being but 509l.; whereas this year, it appears, I have spent 1154l, which is a sum not fit to be said that ever I should spend in one year.

1666-12-31 21:12   To my accounts, wherein, at last, I find them clear and right; but, to my great discontent, do find that my gettings this year have been 573l. less than my last: it being this year in all but 2,986l.; whereas, the last, I got 3,560l.

1666-12-31 10:40 r I staid at the Fleece Tavern in Covent Garden while my boy Tom went to W. Joyce’s to pay what I owed for candles there. Thence to the New Exchange to clear my wife’s score.

1666-12-31 09:48   Rising this day with a full design to mind nothing else but to make up my accounts for the year past, I did take money, and walk forth to several places in the towne as far as the New Exchange, to pay all my debts, it being still a very great frost and good walking.

1666-12-30 09:20   To church, where Mills made a good sermon. Here was a collection for the sexton; but it come into my head why we should be more bold in making the collection while the psalm is singing, than in the sermon or prayer.

1666-12-29 22:25   This day’s good news making me very lively, only the arrears of much business on my hands and my accounts to be settled for the whole year past do lie as a weight on my mind.

1666-12-29 22:20   Home to my chamber, and there late writing, but my left eye still very sore. I write by spectacles all this night, then to supper and to bed.

1666-12-29 09:21   To the office, and have the news brought us of Captain Robinson’s coming with his fleet from Gottenburgh: dispersed, though, by foul weather. But he hath light of five Dutch men-of-war, and taken three, whereof one is sunk; which is very good news to close up the year with.

1666-12-29 06:32   Called up with news from Sir W. Batten that Hogg hath brought in two prizes more: and so I thither, and hear the particulars, which are good; one of them, if prize, being worth 4,000l. for which God be thanked!

1666-12-29 01:25   By chance got a coach and to the Golden Lion Taverne in the Strand, and there drank some mulled sack, and so home, where find my poor wife staying for me, and then to bed mighty cold.

1666-12-29 00:08 r But I sat so high and far off, that I missed most of the words, and sat with a wind coming into my back and neck, which did much trouble me.

1666-12-29 00:05   I did go to White Hall, and got my Lord Bellasses to get me into the playhouse; and there, after all staying above an hour for the players, the King and all waiting, saw “Henry the Fifth” well done by the Duke’s people, and in most excellent habits, all new vests.

1666-12-28 18:10   To the Duke’s house, and there saw “Macbeth” most excellently acted, and a most excellent play for variety.

1666-12-27 21:40   This day a house or two was blown up with powder in the Minorys, and several people spoiled, and many dug out from under the rubbish.

1666-12-27 17:04   By coach to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Scornfull Lady” well acted; Doll Common doing Abigail most excellently, and Knipp the widow very well, and will be an excellent actor, I think. In other parts the play not so well done as used to be, by the old actors.

1666-12-27 13:57   By invitation, my wife, who had not been there these ten months, I think, and I, to meet all our families at Sir W. Batten’s at dinner, whither neither a great dinner for so much company nor anything good or handsome.

1666-12-27 07:32   Up; and called up by the King’s trumpets, which cost me 10s.

1666-12-27 00:56 r To supper, and then to cross purposes, mighty merry, and then to bed, my eyes being sore.

1666-12-26 23:20 r To dance, here being Pembleton come, by my wife’s direction, and a fiddler; and we got, also, the elder Batelier to-night, and Nan Wright, and mighty merry we were, and I danced.

1666-12-26 17:25 r I put the women into a coach, and they to the Duke’s house, to a play which was acted. It was indifferently done, but was not pleased with the song, Gosnell not singing, but a new wench, that sings naughtily.

1666-12-26 12:18 r Here was also Mercer and Creed, whom I met coming home, who tells me of a most bitter lampoone now out against the Court and the management of State from head to foot, mighty witty and mighty severe.

1666-12-26 12:12   Comes Mr. John Andrews and his wife by invitation from Bow to dine with me, and young Batelier and his wife with her great belly, which has spoiled her looks mightily already.

1666-12-26 09:19   I did offer my assistance to Sir J. Minnes to do the business of his office, relating to the Pursers’ accounts, which was accepted by the Duke, and I think I shall do myself good in it, for it will confirm me in the business of the victualling office, which I do very little for.

1666-12-25 22:12   My head thoughtful how to behave myself in the business of the victualling, which I think will be prudence to offer my service in doing something in passing the pursers’ accounts, thereby to serve the King, get honour to myself, and confirm me in my place in the victualling.

1666-12-25 21:19   With my brother reducing the names of all my books to an alphabet, and then to supper, W. Hewer with us, and pretty merry.

1666-12-25 15:26   After dinner, I begun to teach my wife and Barker my song, “It is decreed,” which pleases me mightily as now I have Mr. Hinxton’s base.

1666-12-25 14:03   Dined well on some good ribbs of beef roasted and mince pies; only my wife, brother, and Barker, and plenty of good wine of my own, and my heart full of true joy; and thanks to God Almighty for the goodness of my condition at this day.

1666-12-25 08:20   Lay pretty long in bed, and then rose, leaving my wife desirous to sleep, having sat up till four this morning seeing her maids make mince-pies.

1666-12-24 22:18   Home to the office, and did business till my eyes began to be bad, and so home to supper. My people busy making mince pies, and so to bed.

1666-12-24 20:20   I this evening did buy me a pair of green spectacles, to see whether they will help my eyes or no.

1666-12-24 14:47   After dinner Mercer goes and fetches a little son of Mr. Backeworth’s, the wittiest child and of the most spirit that ever I saw in my life for discourse of all kind, and so ready and to the purpose, not above four years old.

1666-12-24 12:40   I do find that I have overwrought my eyes, so that now they are become apt to be tired, and all excess of light makes them sore, so that now, to the candlelight I am forced to sit by, adding the snow upon the ground all day, my eyes are very bad, and will be worse if not helped.

1666-12-24 12:15   To prevent my Lord Bruncker’s dining here I walked as if upon business with him, it being frost and dry, as far as Paul’s, and so back again through the City by Guildhall, observing the ruines thereabouts, till I did truly lose myself, and so home to dinner.

1666-12-23 21:20   I to my chamber, and with my brother and wife did number all my books in my closet, and took a list of their names, which pleases me mightily, and is a jobb I wanted much to have done.

1666-12-23 16:28   I to the Chapel to find Dr. Gibbons, and from him to the Harp and Ball to transcribe the treble which I would have him to set a bass to.

1666-12-23 15:40   Home, and there dined with us Betty Michell and her husband. After dinner to White Hall by coach, and took them with me. And in the way I would have taken su mano as I did the last time, but she did in a manner withhold it.

1666-12-22 12:10   At the office all the morning, and there come news from Hogg that our shipp hath brought in a Lubecker to Portsmouth, likely to prove prize, of deals, which joys us.

1666-12-21 17:38   Spent all the afternoon in putting some things, pictures especially, in order, and pasting my Lady Castlemayne’s print on a frame, which I have made handsome, and is a fine piece.

1666-12-21 09:28 r And here I had opportunity para besar elle and tocar sus mamelles, so as to make mi mismo espender with great pleasure.

1666-12-21 09:09   I find Mrs. Clerk of Greenwich and her daughter Daniel, their business among other things was a request her daughter was to make, so I took her into my chamber, and there it was to help her husband to the command of a little new pleasure boat building.

1666-12-20 22:12   Home to supper and to bed, after having finished the putting of little papers upon my books to be numbered hereafter.

1666-12-20 13:37   Mrs. Batters is now left a sad widow by the drowning of her husband the other day. I pity her, and will do her what kindness I can; yet I observe that I am colder towards her in my charity than I should be to one so painful as he and she have been.

1666-12-19 16:38 r Sir Allen Brodericke and Sir Allen Apsly did come drunk the other day into the House, and did both speak for half an hour together, and could not be either laughed, or pulled, or bid to sit down and hold their peace, to the great contempt of the King’s servants and cause.

1666-12-19 16:15 r Sir R. Ford did make me understand how the House of Commons is a beast not to be understood, it being impossible to know beforehand the success of any small thing, there being so many to think and speak to any business, and they of so uncertain minds and interests and passions.

1666-12-19 15:40 r Sir W. Batten and Sir R. Ford do tell me that the seamen have been at some prisons, to release some seamen, and the Duke of Albemarle is in armes, and all the Guards at the other end of the town.

1666-12-19 15:32   Upon Tower Hill saw about 3 or 400 seamen get together; and one, standing upon a pile of bricks, made his sign, with his handkercher, upon his stick, and called all the rest to him, and several shouts they gave. This made me afeard; so I got home as fast as I could.

1666-12-19 13:09   The Lieutenant of the Tower took me with him, and would have me to the Tower to dinner; where I dined at the head of his table, next his lady, who is comely and seeming sober and stately, but very proud and very cunning, or I am mistaken, and wanton, too.

1666-12-19 10:10   Met Mr. Hingston the organist, and I took him to the Dog Tavern and got him to set me a bass to my “It is decreed,” which I think will go well, but he commends the song not knowing the words, but says the ayre is good, and believes the words are plainly expressed.

1666-12-18 18:02   To Sir Robert Viner’s about my plate, and carried home another dozen of plates, which makes my stock of plates up 2½ dozen.

1666-12-18 16:38   Thence to the Swan, and there I sent for Sarah, and mighty merry we were, but contra my will were very far from hazer algo.

1666-12-18 15:44 r And she would now have done anything cum ego; and did endeavour, but su cosa stava mala, which did empescar.

1666-12-18 15:42   I to see Mrs. Martin, who is very well, and intends to go abroad tomorrow after her childbed. She do tell me that this child did come is la mëme jour that it ought to hazer after my avoir été con elle before her marido did venir home.

1666-12-18 09:32   I hear the ill news that poor Batters, that had been born and bred a seaman, and brought up his ship from sea but yesterday, was, going down from me to his ship, drowned in the Thames, which is a sad fortune, and do make me afeard, and will do, more than ever I was.

1666-12-17 21:40   Spent the evening in fitting my books, to have the number set upon each, in order to my having an alphabet of my whole, which will be of great ease to me.

1666-12-17 19:03   My wife well home in the evening from the play; which I was glad of, it being cold and dark, and she having her necklace of pearl on, and none but Mercer with her.

1666-12-17 15:10   Captain Batters come from sea in his fireship and come to see me, poor man, as his patron, and a poor painful wretch he is as can be.

1666-12-17 10:48   Comes Mr. Caesar, and then Goodgroome, and, what with one and the other, nothing but musique with me this morning, to my great content; and the more, to see that God Almighty hath put me into condition to bear the charge of all this.

1666-12-16 22:10   And so to bed, my eyes being better today, and I cannot impute it to anything but by my being much in the dark tonight, for I plainly find that it is only excess of light that makes my eyes sore.

1666-12-16 15:42   To White Hall, and there walked up and down to the Queen’s side, and there saw my dear Lady Castlemayne, who continues admirable, methinks, and I do not hear but that the King is the same to her still as ever.

1666-12-16 09:09   To my chamber to set right a picture or two, Lovett having sent me yesterday Sancta Clara’s head varnished, which is very fine, and now my closet is so full stored, and so fine, as I would never desire to have it better.

1666-12-15 11:11   Good news to-day upon the Exchange, that our Hamburgh fleet is got in; and good hopes that we may soon have the like of our Gottenburgh, and then we shall be well for this winter.

1666-12-15 08:30   To the office, where my Lord Bruncker newly come to town, from his being at Chatham and Harwich to spy enormities.

1666-12-14 20:27   I met with, sealed up, from Sir H. Cholmly, the Lampoone, or the Mocke-Advice to a Paynter, abusing the Duke of York and my Lord Sandwich, Pen, and everybody, and the King himself, in all the matters of the navy and warr. I am sorry for my Lord Sandwich’s having a part in it.

1666-12-14 18:12   By coach home, where I find Foundes his present, of a fair pair of candlesticks, and half a dozen of plates come, which cost him full 50l, and is a very good present.

1666-12-14 15:15   I home with Sir Stephen Fox to his house to dinner, and the Cofferer with us. There I find Sir S. Fox’s lady, a fine woman, and seven the prettiest children of theirs that ever I knew almost.

1666-12-14 14:30   I out to the Bell Taverne, and thither comes Doll to me and yo did tocar la cosa of her as I pleased; and after an hour’s stay, away and staid in Westminster Hall till the rising of the house.

1666-12-14 10:03   By coach to White Hall, seeing many smokes of the fire by the way yet, and took up into the coach with me a country gentleman, who asked me room to go with me, it being dirty.

1666-12-13 20:20   I perceive my overworking of my eyes by candlelight do hurt them as it did the last winter, that by day I am well and do get them right, but then after candlelight they begin to be sore and run, so that I intend to get some green spectacles.

1666-12-13 13:45   W. Hewer showed me a Gazette, in April last, which tells how several persons were then found guilty of a design of killing the King and destroying the Government; and as a means to it, to burn the City; and that the day intended for the plot was the 3rd of last September.

1666-12-13 06:10   Being mightily troubled with a pain in the small of my back, through cold, or (which I think most true) my straining to get open my plate chest, in such pain all night I could not turn myself in my bed.

1666-12-12 20:30   News this day from Brampton, of Mr. Ensum, my sister’s sweetheart, being dead: a clowne.

1666-12-12 15:08   They talked for certain, that the King do follow Mrs. Stewart wholly, and my Lady Castlemayne not above once a week; that the Duke of York do not haunt my Lady Denham so much; that she troubles him with matters of State, being of my Lord Bristoll’s faction, and that he avoids.

1666-12-12 14:27   To Captain Cocke’s, and there, by agreement, dined, and there was Charles Porter, Temple, Fern, Debasty, whose bad English and pleasant discourses was exceeding good entertainment, Matt. Wren, Major Cooper, and myself, mighty merry and pretty discourse.

1666-12-12 12:37 r I met little Batelier, who sits here but at 3l. per annum, whereas he sat at the other at 100l, which he says he believes will prove of as good account to him now as the other did at that rent.

1666-12-12 12:10   To the ’Change, where the very good newes is just come of our four ships from Smyrna, come safe without convoy even into the Downes, without seeing any enemy; which is the best, and indeed only considerable good news to our Exchange, since the burning of the City.

1666-12-11 21:05   Anon come our guests, old Mr. Batelier, and his son and daughter, Mercer, which was all our company. We had a good venison pasty and other good cheer, and as merry as in so good, innocent, and understanding company I could be.

1666-12-11 15:28   Mrs. Turner is returning into the North to her children, where, I perceive, her husband hath clearly got the mastery of her, and she is likely to spend her days there, which for her sake I am a little sorry for, though for his it is but fit she should live where he hath a mind.

1666-12-10 21:56   Home to supper, my wife and people being come well and hungry home from Erith. Then I to begin the setting of a Base to “It is Decreed,” and so to bed.

1666-12-10 12:03   At my office all the morning, and several people with me, Sir W. Warren, who I do every day more and more admire for a miracle of cunning and forecast in his business.

1666-12-09 20:02   To my chamber, looking over and tearing and burning all the unnecessary letters, which I have had upon my file for four or five years backward, which I intend to do quite through all my papers, that I may have nothing by me but what is fit to be seen, if I should miscarry.

1666-12-08 21:20   We being in much fear of ill news of our colliers. A fleet of two hundred sail, and fourteen Dutch men-of-war between them and us and they coming home with small convoy; and the City in great want, coals being at 3l. 3s. per chaldron, as I am told.

1666-12-08 17:55 r Here I was in pain to be seen, and hid myself; but, as God would have it, Sir John Chichly come, and sat just by me.

1666-12-08 17:50 r I did see a good part of “The English Monsieur,” which is a mighty pretty play. The women do very well; but, above all, little Nelly; that I am mightily pleased with the play, and much with the House, more than ever I expected, the women doing better than ever I expected.

1666-12-08 14:36   My wife and I and Mrs. Pierce and Betty together out, and our coach broke the wheel off upon Ludgate Hill. So we were fain to get room in other people’s coaches, and Mrs. Pierce and I in one, and I carried her home and set her down, and myself to the King’s playhouse.

1666-12-07 17:50 r It is the first play I have seen in either of the houses since before the great plague, they having acted now about fourteen days publicly. But I was in mighty pain lest I should be seen by any body to be at a play.

1666-12-07 17:45   By water to the Strand, and so to the King’s playhouse, where two acts were almost done when I come in; and there I sat with my cloak about my face, and saw the remainder of “The Mayd’s Tragedy;” a good play, and well acted, especially by the younger Marshall.

1666-12-07 12:45   To dinner, and in comes Mrs. Barbara Sheldon, now Mrs. Wood, and dined with us, she mighty fine, and lives, I perceive, mighty happily, which I am glad for her sake, but hate her husband for a block-head in his choice.

1666-12-07 12:30   Home to dinner, where finding the cloth laid and much crumpled but clean, I grew angry and flung the trenchers about the room, and in a mighty heat I was: so a clean cloth was laid, and my poor wife very patient.

1666-12-07 10:15   To the Exchequer, where I got my tallys finished, and having paid all my fees I to the Swan, whither I sent for some oysters, and thither comes Mr. Falconbridge and Spicer and many more clerks; and there we eat and drank, and a great deal of their sorry discourse.

1666-12-06 21:40   This day, in the Gazette, is the whole story of defeating the Scotch rebells, and of the creation of the Duke of Cambridge, Knight of the Garter.

1666-12-06 18:04 r My wife not pleased with the play, but thinks that it is because she is grown more critical than she used to be, but my brother she says is mighty taken with it.

1666-12-06 14:15   After dinner, my wife and brother, in another habit, go out to see a play; but I am not to take notice that I know of my brother’s going.

1666-12-06 13:32   Harman dined with us, and great sport to hear him tell how Will Joyce grows rich by the custom of the City coming to his end of the town, and how he rants over his brother and sister for their keeping an Inn, and tears like a prince, calling him hosteller and his sister hostess.

1666-12-05 21:50   To supper and talk, and then scold with my wife for not reckoning well the times that her music master hath been with her, but setting down more than I am sure, and did convince her, they had been with her, and in an ill humour of anger with her to bed.

1666-12-05 13:29   Goodgroome dined with us, who teaches my wife to sing. After dinner I did give him my song, “Beauty retire,” which he has often desired of me, and without flattery I think is a very good song.

1666-12-04 21:58   To supper much eased in mind, and last night’s good news, which is more and more confirmed with particulars to very good purpose, and so to bed.

1666-12-03 21:32 r Three or four hundred killed or taken, among which their leader, one Wallis, and seven ministers, they having all taken the Covenant a few days before, and sworn to live and die in it, as they did; and so all is likely to be there quiet again.

1666-12-03 21:30   So to bed, and with more cheerfulness than I have done a good while, to hear that the Scott rebells are all routed; they having been so bold as to come within three miles of Edinburgh, and there given two or three repulses to the King’s forces, but at last were mastered.

1666-12-03 21:22   I to the Swan, and there did the first time bezar the little sister of Sarah that is come into her place, and so away by coach home, where to my vyall and supper and then to bed, being weary of the following of my pleasure.

1666-12-03 18:39   I found out Burroughs, and called at the cake house by Hales’s, and there eat and drank and then carried her home – with much ado making her to tocar mi cosa, she being endeed very averse a alguna cosa of that kind. Howver, time can hazzer-la, the same as it hath hecho others.

1666-12-03 13:40   Kate Joyce dined with me. Her husband and she are weary of their new life of being an Innkeeper, and will leave it, and would fain get some office; but I know none the foole is fit for, but would be glad to help them, if I could.

1666-12-03 10:24   To the Exchequer, and put my tallys in a way of doing for the last quarter. But my not following it the last week has occasioned the clerks some trouble, which I am sorry for, and they are mad at.
