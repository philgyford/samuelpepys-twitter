1666-04-01 r 00:31 Busy also I am in thoughts for a husband for my sister, and to that end my wife and I have determined that she shall presently go into the country to my father and mother, and consider of a proffer made them for her in the country, which, if she likes, shall go forward.

1666-04-01 r 00:25 I was forced to go to bed and leave my accounts much against my will, and vow too, but I hope God will forgive me, for I have sat up these four nights till past twelve at night to master them, but cannot.

1666-04-01   00:15 Home and to my accounts, where very late at them, but, Lord! what a deal of do I have to understand any part of them, and in short do what I could, I could not come to any understanding of them.
