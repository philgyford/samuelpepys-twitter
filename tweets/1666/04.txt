1666-04-16 19:29   I called for my papers and so home, and there comes Mrs. Turner and Mercer and supped with me, and well pleased I was with their company, but especially Mrs. Turner’s, she being a very pretty woman of person and her face pretty good, the colour of her hair very fine and light.

1666-04-16 17:05   To Westminster, thinking to have met Mrs. Martin, but could not find her, so back and called at Kirton’s to borrow 10s. to pay for my ruled papers, I having not money in my pocket enough to pay for them. 

1666-04-15 21:07   To Mr. Pierce again; and he being gone forth, she and I and the children out by coach to Kensington, to where we were the other day, and with great pleasure stayed till night; and were mighty late getting home, the horses tiring and stopping at every twenty steps.

1666-04-15 13:14 r For certain Mrs. Stewart do do everything with the King that a mistress should do; and that the King hath many bastard children that are known and owned, besides the Duke of Monmouth.

1666-04-15 13:08   I walked to Mr. Pierces, and there dined, I alone with him and her and their children: very good company and good discourse, they being able to tell me all the businesses of the Court.

1666-04-15 09:42 r I do see very little difference between the degree of the ceremonies used by our people in the administration thereof, and that in the Roman church, saving that methought our Chapel was not so fine, nor the manner of doing it so glorious, as it was in the Queene’s chapel.

1666-04-15 09:38 r I staid till the King went down to receive the Sacrament, and stood in his closett with a great many others, and there saw him receive it, which I did never see the manner of before.

1666-04-15 09:08   To the Queen’s chapel, and there heard a good deal of their mass, and some of their musique, which is not so contemptible, I think, as our people would make it, it pleasing me very well.

1666-04-14 14:32   Sir H. Cholmley being gone and all these accounts cleared I shall be even with the King, so as to make a very clear and short account in a very few days, which pleases me very well.

1666-04-14 01:10   Comes Creed and with him till past one in the morning, evening his accounts till my head aked and I was fit for nothing, however, coming at last luckily to see through and settle all to my mind, it did please me mightily.

1666-04-13 12:15   Called upon an old woman in Pannier Ally to agree for ruling of some paper for me and she will do it pretty cheap.

1666-04-13 11:39 r We fell into discourse of my picture, and I am for his putting out the Landskipp, though he says it is very well done, yet I do judge it will be best without it, and so it shall be put out, and be made a plain sky like my wife’s picture, which will be very noble.

1666-04-13 11:28   To White Hall, to spend an hour in the galleries there among the pictures, Mr. Hales showing me the difference in the paintings, and when I come more and more to distinguish and observe the workmanship, I do not find so many good things as I thought there was.

1666-04-13 09:55   To Mr. Hales’s, where it is pretty strange to see that his second doing, I mean the second time of her sitting, is less like Mrs. Pierce than the first, and yet I am confident will be most like her, for he is so curious that I do not see how it is possible for him to mistake.

1666-04-13 08:10   Up, being called up by my wife’s brother, for whom I have got a commission from the Duke of Yorke for Muster-Master of one of the divisions, of which Harman is Rere-Admirall, of which I am glad as well as he.

1666-04-12 18:04   I to the office, where my Lord Bruncker come; and he and I had a little fray, he being, I find, a very peevish man, if he be denied what he expects.

1666-04-12 16:22   My Lady Pen comes to me and takes me into her house. I did stay talking and playing the fool almost all the afternoon, and there saw two or three foolish sorry pictures of her doing, but very ridiculous compared to what my wife do. She grows mighty homely and looks old.

1666-04-11 21:42   Home and did a great jobb at my Tangier accounts, which I find are mighty apt to run into confusion, my head also being too full of other businesses and pleasures. 

1666-04-11 17:26   To Gresham College, where a great deal of do and formality in choosing of the Council and Officers. I had three votes to be of the Council, who am but a stranger, nor expected any.

1666-04-11 11:11   I to Hales’s, where there was nothing found to be done more to my picture, but the musique, which now pleases me mightily, it being painted true.

1666-04-11 09:20   To White Hall, having first set my people to work about setting me rails upon the leads of my wife’s closet, a thing I have long designed, but never had a fit opportunity till now.

1666-04-10 16:49   To the office again all the afternoon, where we sat all, the first time of our resolution to sit both forenoons and afternoons.

1666-04-09 19:58 r We went away (I for my part in great disorder) for Kensington, and there I spent about 30s. upon the jades with great pleasure, and we sang finely and staid till about eight at night, the night coming on apace.

1666-04-09 17:23   To Mrs. Pierce’s, and with her and Knipp and Mrs. Pierce’s boy and girl abroad, thinking to have been merry at Chelsey; but being come almost to the house by coach near the waterside, a gentleman walking by called to us to tell us that the house was shut up of the sickness.

1666-04-09 07:49   With my Joyner begun the making of the window in my boy’s chamber bigger, purposing it shall be a room to eat and for having musique in.

1666-04-08 22:15   Had Mercer comb my head and so to supper, sing a psalm, and to bed.

1666-04-08 10:20   The Court full this morning of the news of Tom Cheffin’s death, the King’s closet-keeper. He was well last night as ever, flaying at tables in the house, and not very ill this morning at six o’clock, yet dead before seven: they think, of an impostume in his breast.

1666-04-08 08:10   Up, and was in great trouble how to get a passage to White Hall, it raining, and no coach to be had. So I walked to the Old Swan, and there got a scull.

1666-04-07 22:12   W. Hewer comes to me to tell me that he has left my wife well this morning at Bugden, which was great riding, and brings me a letter from her. She is very well got thither, of which I am heartily glad.

1666-04-07 17:47 r I took them to the cakehouse, and there called in the coach for cakes and drank, and thence I carried them to my Lord Chancellor’s new house to shew them that, and all mightily pleased.

1666-04-07 15:22   Took Bab. Allen by coach to Hales’s, and there find Mrs. Pierce and her boy and Mary. She had done sitting the first time, and indeed her face is mighty like at first dash.

1666-04-07 14:10   With my Lord Bruncker home by coach to Mrs. Williams’s, where Bab. Allen and Dr. Charleton dined. Bab and I sang and were mighty merry as we could be there, where the rest of the company did not overplease.

1666-04-07 08:49   Lay pretty long to-day, lying alone and thinking of several businesses.

1666-04-06 20:32   This day great news of the Swedes declaring for us against the Dutch, and, so far as that, I believe it.

1666-04-06 19:12   I home, where all things, methinks, melancholy in the absence of my wife.

1666-04-06 17:03   To Mr. Hales and there sat, and my picture almost finished, which by the word of Mr. and Mrs. Pierce (who come in accidentally) is mighty like, and I am sure I am mightily pleased both in the thing and the posture.

1666-04-06 05:04   Up mighty betimes upon my wife’s going this day toward Brampton. I could not go to the coach with her, but W. Hewer did and hath leave from me to go the whole day’s journey with her.

1666-04-05 22:05   The plague is, to our great grief, increased nine this week, though decreased a few in the total. And this increase runs through many parishes, which makes us much fear the next year.

1666-04-05 22:04   I to the office all the afternoon till late, and so home and late putting notes to “It is decreed, nor shall thy fate, &c.” and then to bed.

1666-04-05 14:32   Home, where I find my wife hath on a sudden, upon notice of a coach going away to-morrow, taken a resolution of going in it to Brampton, we having lately thought it fit for her to go to satisfy herself and me in the nature of the fellow that is there proposed to my sister.

1666-04-05 13:27   Dining with my Lord Bruncker and his mistress with Captain Cocke, a good dinner, but the woman do tire me, and indeed how simply my Lord Bruncker, who is otherwise a wise man, do proceed at the table in serving of Cocke, would make a man think him a foole.

1666-04-05 10:05   To the office, where the falseness and impertinencies of Sir W. Pen would make a man mad to think of.

1666-04-05 08:44   To Lumbard Streete, and there at Viner’s was shown the silver plates, made for Captain Cocke to present my Lord Bruncker; and I chose a dozen of the same weight to be bespoke for myself, which he told me yesterday he would give me on the same occasion.

1666-04-04 22:16   After supper to bed, consulting how to send my wife into the country to advise about Pall’s marriage, which I much desire, and my father too, and two or three offers are now in hand.

1666-04-04 20:20   Abroad by coach to Hales’s, and there sat till night, mightily pleased with my picture, which is now almost finished.

1666-04-04 13:52   After done several businesses at the ’Change I home, and being washing day dined upon cold meat.

1666-04-04 08:50   With Sir W. Pen in his coach to White Hall, in his way talking simply and fondly as he used to do, but I find myself to slight him and his simple talk, I thank God, and that my condition will enable me to do it.

1666-04-03 22:28   Home and supped and to my accounts again till I was ready to sleep, there being no pleasure to handle them, if they are not kept in good order. So to bed.

1666-04-03 19:50   I to my accounts hard all the afternoon till it was quite dark, and I thank God I do come to bring them very fairly to make me worth 5,000l. stock in the world, which is a great mercy to me. 

1666-04-02 22:32   Home, and to my accounts which I cannot get through with. But at it till I grew drowsy, and so to bed mightily vexed that I can come to no better issue in my accounts.

1666-04-02 17:12   To Westminster Hall, where I purposely took my wife well dressed into the Hall to see and be seen; and, among others, Howlet’s daughter, who is newly married, and is she I call wife, and one I love mightily.

1666-04-02 11:28   Sir W. Warren very wisely did show me that my matching my sister with Mr. Gawden would undo me in all my places, everybody suspecting me in all I do; and I shall neither be able to serve him, nor free myself from imputation of being of his faction.

1666-04-02 10:33   With Mr. Gawden in Westminster Hall, he and I to talk of his son Benjamin; and I propounded a match for him, and at last named my sister, which he embraces heartily. This did mightily rejoice me.

1666-04-02 09:40   With Mr. Gawden to Guildhall to see the bills and tallies there in the chamber (and by the way in the street his new coach broke and we fain to take an old hackney).

1666-04-01 22:45   Home, where to my accounts, and was at them till I could not hold open my eyes, and so to bed.

1666-04-01 16:43   I made a visit to my Lady Carteret, whom I understood newly come to town; and she took it mighty kindly, but I see her face and heart are dejected from the condition her husband’s matters stand in.

1666-04-01 14:58   With my uncle Wight and a gentleman he met with to my Lord Chancellor’s new house, and there viewed it again and again and up to the top and I like it as well as ever and think it a most noble house.

1666-04-01 10:32   The Queen, I hear, do not yet hear of the death of her mother, she being in a course of physic, that they dare not tell it her.

1666-04-01 10:10   To the Queen’s chapel; where I do not so dislike the music. Here I saw on a post an invitation to all good Catholics to pray for the soul of such a one departed this life.

1666-04-01 08:04   Up and abroad, to wait on Sir Philip Howard; whom I found in bed: and he do receive me very civilly. My request was about suffering my wife’s brother to go to sea, and to save his pay in the Duke’s guards; which after a little difficulty he did with great respect agree to.

1666-04-01 00:31 r Busy also I am in thoughts for a husband for my sister, and to that end my wife and I have determined that she shall presently go into the country to my father and mother, and consider of a proffer made them for her in the country, which, if she likes, shall go forward.

1666-04-01 00:25 r I was forced to go to bed and leave my accounts much against my will, and vow too, but I hope God will forgive me, for I have sat up these four nights till past twelve at night to master them, but cannot.

1666-04-01 00:15   Home and to my accounts, where very late at them, but, Lord! what a deal of do I have to understand any part of them, and in short do what I could, I could not come to any understanding of them.
