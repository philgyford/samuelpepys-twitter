1666-10-31 21:25 r It being not yet, I believe, too late if the King would apply himself to it, to save all, and conquer the Dutch; but while he and the Duke of York mind their pleasure, as they do and nothing else, we must be beaten.

1666-10-31 21:20   I do methinks foresee great unhappiness coming upon us, and do provide for it by laying by something against a rainy day, dividing what I have, and laying it in several places, but with all faithfulness to the King in all respects.

1666-10-31 20:50   To my satisfaction I do find that I do bring my accounts to a very near balance, notwithstanding all the troubles I have been put to by the late fire; and I bless God I do find that I am worth more than ever I yet was, which is 6,200l, for which the Holy Name of God be praised!

1666-10-31 09:38   Coming out of the Court I met Colonell Atkins, who tells me the whole city rings today of Sir Jeremy Smith’s killing of Holmes in a duell, at which I was not much displeased, for I fear every day more and more mischief from the man, if he lives; but the thing is not true.

1666-10-31 07:40   Out with Sir W. Batten toward White Hall, being in pain in my cods by being squeezed the other night in a little coach when I carried Pierce and his wife and my people. But I hope I shall be soon well again.

1666-10-30 20:38   Home to supper, and singing with my wife, who hath lately begun to learn, and I think will come to do something, though her eare is not good, nor I, I confess, have patience enough to teach her.

1666-10-30 16:48 r His wife being much frightened in the country with the discourses of troubles and disorders like to be, and therefore durst not be from him, and therefore he is forced to bring her to towne that they may be together.

1666-10-30 16:40   Mr. Hater staying most of the afternoon abroad, he come to me, poor man, to make excuse, and it was that he had been looking out for a little house for his family.

1666-10-29 21:38 r But the play being “Love in a Tub,” a silly play, and though done by the Duke’s people, yet having neither Betterton nor his wife, and the whole thing done ill, and being ill also, I had no manner of pleasure in the play.

1666-10-29 18:03 r By and by Mr. Pierce comes, bringing my wife and his, and Knipp. By and by the King and Queen, Duke and Duchesse, and all the great ladies of the Court; which, indeed, was a fine sight.

1666-10-29 17:42 r I away to White Hall, and into the new playhouse there, the first time I ever was there, and the first play I have seen since before the great plague.

1666-10-29 17:04   I took my wife (who is mighty fine, and with a new fair pair of locks, which vex me, though like a fool I helped her the other night to buy them), and to Mrs. Pierce’s.

1666-10-29 16:40   To discourse with my brother upon his translation of my Lord Bacon’s “Faber Fortunae,” which I gave him to do and he has done it, but meanely; I am not pleased with it at all, having done it only literally, but without any life at all.

1666-10-29 15:50   To my goldsmith to bid him look out for some gold for me; and he tells me that ginnys, which I bought 2,000 of not long ago, and cost me but 18½d. change, will now cost me 22d; and but very few to be had at any price. However, some more I will have, for they are very convenient.

1666-10-29 15:20   By coach (having in the Hall bought me a velvet riding cap, cost me 20s.) to my taylor’s, and there bespoke a plain vest.

1666-10-29 14:12   I find the new Lord Mayor Bolton a-swearing at the Exchequer, with some of the Aldermen and Livery; but, Lord! to see how meanely they now look, who upon this day used to be all little lords, is a sad sight and worthy consideration.

1666-10-28 21:20   The Revenge having her forecastle blown up with powder to the killing of some men in the River, and the Dyamond’s being overset in the careening at Sheernesse, are further marks of the method all the King’s work is now done in.

1666-10-28 16:50   I with my brother to White Hall and he to Westminster Abbey. I presently to Mrs. Martin’s, and there met widow Burroughes and Doll, and did tumble them all the afternoon as I pleased.

1666-10-28 13:10   Captain Guy cries out of the discipline of the fleet, and confesses really that the true English valour we talk of is almost spent and worn out; few of the commanders doing what they should do, and he much fears we shall therefore be beaten the next year.

1666-10-27 17:15 r I took them out to the New Exchange, and there my wife bought things, and I did give each of them a pair of Jesimy plain gloves, and another of white. Here Knipp and I walked up and down to see handsome faces, and did see several.

1666-10-27 14:13   Home to dinner, where Mrs. Pierce and her boy and Knipp, who sings as well, and is the best company in the world, dined with us, and infinite merry. The playhouses begin to play next week.

1666-10-27 10:20   Several letters out of the country, saying how high the Catholiques are everywhere and bold in the owning their religion, have made the Commons mad, and they presently voted that the King be desired to put all Catholiques out of employment, and other high things.

1666-10-26 19:38   Out, the first time I ever was abroad with Doll Lane, to the Dog tavern, and there drank with her, a bad face, but good bodied girl. Did nothing but salute and play with her and talk.

1666-10-26 16:15   All the morning and most of the afternoon within doors, beginning to set my accounts in order from before this fire, I being behindhand with them ever since; and this day I got most of my tradesmen to bring in their bills and paid them.

1666-10-25 17:27   I to my Lord Bruncker’s, and with him to Mrs. Williams’s where we met Knipp. I was glad to see the jade. Made her sing and she told us they begin at both houses to act on Monday next. Mrs. Williams says the Duke’s house will be much the better of the two, because of their women.

1666-10-25 14:55 r Mrs. Pierce was making herself mighty fine to go to a great ball to-night at Court, being the Queene’s birthday; so the ladies for this one day do wear laces, but to put them off again tomorrow.

1666-10-25 14:30   I out with my wife to Mrs. Pierce’s, where she hath not been a great while, from some little unkindness of my wife’s to her when she was last here, but she received us with mighty respect and discretion.

1666-10-24 21:33   I took my wife into the garden, and there layed open our condition as to our estate, and the danger of my having it all in the house at once, in case of any disorder or troubles in the State, and therefore resolved to remove part of it to Brampton, and part some whither else.

1666-10-24 14:22   Abroad with my wife, she to see her brother, who is sick, and she believes is from some discontent his wife hath given him by her loose carriage, which he is told, and he hath found has been very suspicious in his absence, which I am sorry for.

1666-10-24 10:07   To White Hall, where we attended the Duke; and to all our complaints for want of money, which now we are tired out with making, the Duke only tells us that he is sorry for it, and hath spoke to the King of it, and money we shall have as soon as it can be found.

1666-10-24 08:28   Down to the Old Swan, and there find little Michell come to his new shop that he hath built there in the room of his house that was burned. I hope he will do good here. I drank and bade him joy, for I love him and his wife well, him for his care, and her for her person.

1666-10-23 16:16 r I paid her 10l. 1s. that I received upon a ticket for her husband, which is a great kindness I have done them, and having kissed her as much as I would, I away, poor wretch.

1666-10-23 16:10   I by water to Shadwell, to see Betty Michell, the first time I was ever at their new dwelling since the fire, and there find her in the house all alone. I find her mighty modest, but had her lips as much as I would, and indeed she is mighty pretty, that I love her exceedingly.

1666-10-22 15:04   To my Lord Belasses, where Creed and Povy by appointment met to discourse of some of their Tangier accounts between my Lord and Vernatty, who will prove a very knave.

1666-10-22 10:30   Home, where I find Mr. Caesar playing the treble to my boy upon the Theorbo, the first time I heard him, which pleases me mightily.

1666-10-21 22:47   My people being gone most of them to bed, my boy and Jane and I did get two of my iron chests out of the cellar into my closet, and the money to my great satisfaction to see it there again, and the rather because the damp cellar spoils all my chests.

1666-10-21 17:14   I went to see and sat a good while with Mrs. Martin, and there was her sister Doll, with whom, contrary to all expectation, I did what I would, and might have done anything else.

1666-10-21 15:43   Sir H. Cholmly told me how Harry Killigrew is banished the Court lately, for saying that my Lady Castlemayne was a little lecherous girl when she was young, and used to rub her thing with her fingers or against the end of forms, and that she must be rubbed wth something else.

1666-10-21 14:25 r To see how like an image the King sat and could not speak one word when I had delivered myself was very strange; only my Lord Chancellor did ask me, whether I thought it was in nature at this time to help us to anything.

1666-10-21 14:04   I by coach to White Hall, and there attended the Cabinet, and was called in before the King and them to give an account of our want of money for Tangier, which troubles me that it should be my place so often and so soon after one another to come to speak there of their wants.

1666-10-20 13:40   To dinner, with Sir G. Carteret, my Lady and Mr. Ashburnham, the Cofferer. Here they talk that the Queene hath a great mind to alter her fashion, and to have the feet seen, which she loves mightily; and they do believe that it will come into it in a little time.

1666-10-20 11:32   Sir G. Carteret told me my Lord Chancellor did ask him how it come to pass that his friend Pepys do so much magnify all things to worst in the bad condition of the fleet. Sir G. Carteret tells me that he answered him, that I was but the mouth of the rest.

1666-10-20 09:55   Commissioner Middleton says that nothing can do the King more disservice, nor please the standing officers of the ship better than these silly commanders that now we have, for they sign to anything their officers desire of them, nor have judgment to contradict them if they would.

1666-10-20 08:42 r He tells me he hears of nothing but of swearing and drinking and whoring, and all manner of profaneness, quite through the whole fleet.

1666-10-20 08:27   I walked a good while with Mr. Gawden in the garden, who is lately come from the fleet at the buoy of the Nore, and he do tell me how all the sober commanders, and even Sir Thomas Allen himself, do complain of the ill government of the fleet.

1666-10-19 18:12 r Nothing but distraction and confusion; which makes me wish with all my heart that I were well and quietly settled with what little I have got at Brampton, where I might live peaceably, and study, and pray for the good of the King and my country.

1666-10-19 16:32 r Sir G. Carteret asked me whether 50l. or 60l. would do us any good; and when I told him the very rum man must have 200l, he held up his eyes as if we had asked a million.

1666-10-19 16:15   I did lay the state of our condition before the Duke of York, that the fleet could not go out without several things it wanted, and we could not have without money, particularly rum and bread, and a few other small sums of 200l. a piece to some others.

1666-10-19 14:58   Sir Robert Viner told me a little of the disorder and mutiny among the seamen at the Treasurer’s office, which did trouble me then and all day since, considering how many more seamen will come to town every day, and no money for them.

1666-10-19 14:10   To Povy’s, who continues as much confounded in all his business as ever he was; and would have had me paid money, as like a fool as himself, which I troubled him in refusing; but I did persist in it.

1666-10-18 20:38   Mightily pleased in mind that I have got my bills of imprest cleared by bills signed this day, to my good satisfaction.

1666-10-18 16:33 r The poor people of the house had good wine, and a good cake; and she a pretty woman in her lying-in dress. It cost me near 40s. the whole christening: to midwife 20s, nurse 10s, mayde 2s. 6d, and the coach 5s. I was very well satisfied with what I have done, and so home.

1666-10-18 15:58   To Lovett’s, where I stood godfather. But it was pretty, that, being a Protestant, a man stood by and was my Proxy to answer for me. A priest christened it, and the boy’s name is Samuel. The ceremonies many, and some foolish.

1666-10-18 14:45   Wondering at what a good pretty wench our Barker makes, being now put into good clothes, and fashionable, at my charge; but it becomes her, so that I do not now think much of it, and is an example of the power of good clothes and dress.

1666-10-18 13:38   My Lord Bruncker proffered to carry me and my wife into a play at Court tonight, and to lend me his coach home, which tempted me much; but I shall not do it.

1666-10-18 09:04   The waters so high in the roads, by the late rains, that our letters come not in till to-day, and now I understand that my father is got well home, but had a painful journey of it.

1666-10-17 21:32   To my chamber, and there late upon making up an account for the Board to pass tomorrow, if I can get them, for the clearing all my imprest bills, which if I can do, will be to my very good satisfaction.

1666-10-17 15:32   The Court is all full of vests, only my Lord St. Albans not pinked but plain black; and they say the King says the pinking upon white makes them look too much like magpyes, and therefore hath bespoke one of plain velvet.

1666-10-17 14:28   After dinner took my brother and my wife and Barker (for so is our new woman called, and is yet but a sorry girl), and set them down at Unthanke’s.

1666-10-17 12:04   Alone with my brother, and find he hath preached but twice in his life. I did give him some advice to study pronunciation; but I do fear he will never make a good speaker nor, I fear, any general good scholar, for I do not see that he minds optickes or mathematics of any sort.

1666-10-16 13:40   To the office, after hearing my brother play a little upon the Lyra viall, which he do so as to show that he hath a love to musique and a spirit for it, which I am well pleased with.

1666-10-15 16:50   At Sir W. Batten’s I met Sir W. Pen, lately come from the fleet at the Nore; and here were many good fellows, among others Sir R. Holmes, who is exceeding kind to me, more than usual, which makes me afeard of him, though I do much wish his friendship.

1666-10-15 15:23   To the Temple, and there looked upon a new book, set out by one Rycault, secretary to my Lord Winchelsea, of the policy and customs of the Turks, which is, it seems, much cried up.

1666-10-15 13:53 r Nay, she told me that they have heretofore had plays at Court the very nights before the fast for the death of the late King. he do much cry out upon these things, and that which she believes will undo the whole nation; and I fear so too.

1666-10-15 13:46 r My Lady Carteret cries out of the vices of the Court, and how they are going to set up plays already; and how, the next day after the late great fast, the Duchesse of York did give the King and Queen a play.

1666-10-15 13:20   My Lady Carteret tells me the ladies are to go into a new fashion shortly, and that is, to wear short coats, above their anckles; which she and I do not like, but conclude this long trayne to be mighty graceful.

1666-10-15 10:52 r Being a long cassocke close to the body, of black cloth, and pinked with white silk under it, and a coat over it, and the legs ruffled with black riband like a pigeon’s leg; and, upon the whole, I wish the King may keep it, for it is a very fine and handsome garment.

1666-10-15 10:50   This day the King begins to put on his vest, and I did see several persons of the House of Lords and Commons too, great courtiers, who are in it.

1666-10-15 09:28   Sir H. Cholmley tells me that Lady Castlemayne is concluded to be with child again; and that all the people about the King do make no scruple of saying that the King do lie with Mrs. Stewart, who, he says, is a most excellent-natured lady.

1666-10-14 15:07   I met with Sir Stephen Fox, who told me how much right I had done myself, and how well it is represented by the Committee to the House, my readiness to give them satisfaction in everything when they were at the office. I was glad of this.

1666-10-14 09:40   I to church, which was mighty full, and my beauties, Mrs. Lethulier and fair Batelier, both there. A very foul morning, and rained; and sent for my cloake to go out of the church with.

1666-10-13 22:21   I by coach home, calling for a new pair of shoes, and so, little being to do at the office, did go home, and after spending a little in righting some of my books, which stood out of order, I to bed.

1666-10-13 17:04 r I did never observe how much easier a man do speak when he knows all the company to be below him, than in him; for though he spoke excellent well, yet his manner and freedom of doing it, as if he played with it and was informing only all the rest of the company, was pretty.

1666-10-13 16:52 r I am mad in love with my Lord Chancellor, for he do comprehend and speak out well, and with the greatest easinesse and authority that ever I saw man in my life.

1666-10-13 16:40   The Duke and my Lord Chancellor, and Duke of Albemarle, and Prince Rupert, Lord Bellasses, Sir H. Cholmly, Povy, and myself, met at a Committee for Tangier.

1666-10-13 16:20 r So I stood and saw the Duke dress himself, and try on his vest, which is the King’s new fashion, and will be in it for good and all, and the whole Court: it is a fashion, the King says; he will never change.

1666-10-13 16:05   I to White Hall, and there the Duke of York (who is gone over to all his pleasures again, and leaves off care of business, what with his woman, my Lady Denham, and his hunting three times a week) was just come in from hunting.

1666-10-12 21:38   I met with notice of a meeting of the Commissioners for Tangier tomorrow, and so I must have my accounts ready for them, which caused me to confine myself to my chamber presently and set to the making up my accounts.

1666-10-12 21:10 r And which is more, her voice, for want of use, is so furred, that it do not at present please me; but her manner of singing is such, that I shall, I think, take great pleasure in it. Well, she is come, and I wish us good fortune in her.

1666-10-12 20:50   I find my wife come home, and hath brought her new girle I have helped her to, of Mr. Falconbridge’s. She is wretched poor; and but ordinary favoured; and we fain to lay out seven or eight pounds worth of clothes upon her back, which, methinks, do go against my heart.

1666-10-12 18:20   By water with Cropp to Deptford. It was almost night before I got thither. So I did only give directions concerning a press that I have making there to hold my turning and joyner’s tooles that were lately given me, which will be very handsome.

1666-10-12 14:33   To the Swan, and there sent for a piece of meat and dined alone and played with Sarah, and so to the Hall a while, and thence to Mrs. Martin’s lodging and did what I would with her. She is very big, and resolves I must be godfather.

1666-10-12 09:48   I with Sir W. Coventry to Westminster Hall, and there took a few turns, the Hall mighty full of people, and the House likely to be very full to-day about the money business.

1666-10-11 09:03   Discoursed with my father of my sending some money for safety into the country, for I am in pain what to do with what I have. I did give him money, poor man, and he overjoyed.

1666-10-10 22:20   Home to supper, and to bed, it being my wedding night, but how many years I cannot tell; but my wife says ten.

1666-10-10 20:10   To the Swan, and baisai la fille, and drank, and then home by coach, and took father, wife, brother, and W. Hewer to Islington, where I find mine host dead.

1666-10-10 15:32   To church, and there was Mr. Frampton in the pulpit, they cry up so much, a young man, and of a mighty ready tongue. I heard a little of his sermon, and liked it; but the crowd so great, I could not stay.

1666-10-09 23:45   Home, and to supper with my father, and then to set my remainder of my books gilt in order with much pleasure, and so late to bed.

1666-10-08 20:10   I returned, full of thoughts of the consequences of this ill complexion of affairs, and how to save myself and the little I have, which if I can do, I have cause to bless God that I am so well, and shall be contented to retreat to Brampton, and spend the rest of my days there.

1666-10-08 18:24   The King hath yesterday in Council declared his resolution of setting a fashion for clothes, which he will never alter. It will be a vest, I know not well how; but it is to teach the nobility thrift, and will do good.

1666-10-08 17:54   Mr. Pierce telling me how the Duke of York and Duke of Albemarle do not agree. The Duke of York is wholly given up to this bitch of Denham. The Duke of Albemarle and Prince Rupert do less agree. So that we are all in pieces, and nobody knows what will be done the next year.

1666-10-08 16:26   I to Unthanke’s, where Mr. Falconbridge’s girl is, and by and by comes my wife, who likes her well, though I confess I cannot, because she will be raised from so mean a condition to so high all of a sudden; but she will be much to our profit, more than Mercer, less expense.

1666-10-08 14:38   The House did this day order to be engrossed the Bill against importing Irish cattle; a thing, it seems, carried on by the Western Parliament-men, wholly against the sense of most of the rest of the House; who think if you do this, you give the Irish again cause to rebel.

1666-10-08 12:12   To Westminster Hall, and there by several hear that the Parliament do resolve to do something to retrench Sir G. Carteret’s great salary; but cannot hear of any thing bad they can lay to his charge.

1666-10-07 21:21   I made my brother in his cassocke to say grace this day, but I like his voice so ill that I begin to be sorry he hath taken this order upon him.

1666-10-07 17:13 r The King hath found out how to supply us with 5 or 6000l, when 100,000l. were at this time but absolutely necessary, and we mentioned 50,000l. This is every day a greater and greater omen of ruine. God fit us for it!

1666-10-07 15:20 r Nobody beginning, I did, and made a current, and I thought a good speech, laying open the ill state of the Navy: by the greatness of the debt; greatness of work to do against next yeare; the time and materials it would take; and our incapacity, through a total want of money.

1666-10-07 14:58 r Anon we were called in to the Green Room, where the King, Duke of York, Prince Rupert, Lord Chancellor, Lord Treasurer, Duke of Albemarle, [Sirs] G. Carteret, W. Coventry, Morrice.

1666-10-07 14:38   I with Sir J. Minnes to White Hall, where met by Sir W. Batten and Lord Bruncker, to attend the King and Duke of York at the Cabinet; but nobody had determined what to speak of. So I was forced immediately to prepare in my mind a method of discoursing.

1666-10-06 17:45 r My wife sent to have her see the gentlewoman; but sings basely, and is a tawdry wench that would take 8l, but my wife nor I think her fit to come.

1666-10-06 16:37   My wife told me of a fine gentlewoman my Lady Pen tells her of, for 20l. per annum, that sings, dances, plays on four or five instruments and many other fine things, which pleases me mightily.

1666-10-06 15:42   Sir W. Coventry told me it is always observed, that by bringing over one discontented man, you raise up three in his room; which is a State lesson I never knew before.

1666-10-06 10:12   I to the office of the ordnance to be satisfied in something, and find their accounts and books kept in mighty good order, but that they can give no light, nor will the nature of their affairs permit it to tell what the charge of the ordnance comes to a man a month.

1666-10-05 21:26 r He do believe there is above 50,000l. of books burned; all the great booksellers almost undone: not only these, but their warehouses at their Hall, and under Christchurch, and elsewhere being all burned.

1666-10-05 21:24 r The goods laid in the Churchyard fired through the windows those in St. Fayth’s church; and those coming to the warehouses’ doors fired them, and burned all the books and the pillars of the church, so as the roof falling down, broke quite down.

1666-10-05 21:20   Mr. Kirton’s kinsman, my bookseller, come in my way; and so I am told by him that Mr. Kirton is utterly undone, and made 2 or 3000l. worse than nothing, from being worth 7 or 8,000l.

1666-10-05 16:38   Sir W. Coventry tells me that the Subcommittee have made their report to the Grand Committee, and in pretty kind terms, and have agreed upon allowing us 4l. per head, which I am sure will do the business, but he had endeavoured to have got more, but this do well.

1666-10-05 09:23   To the office, and there troubled with a message from Lord Peterborough about money; but I did give as kind answer as I could, though I hate him.

1666-10-04 22:49   Late with Mr. Hater upon comparing the charge and husbandry of the last Dutch war with ours now, and do find good room to think we have done little worse than they, whereof good use may and will be made.

1666-10-04 18:32   I to the office all day, and spent most of it with Sir W. Warren, whom I have had no discourse with a great while, and when all is done I do find him a mighty wise man as any I know, and his counsel as much to be followed.

1666-10-04 10:58   I to Sir G. Carteret, to his lodging, and here discoursed much of the want of money and our being designed for destruction. How the King hath lost his power, by submitting himself to this way of examining his accounts, and is become but as a private man.

1666-10-04 06:32   Sir W. Coventry did tell me his speech to the House in his owne vindication about the report of his selling of places, he having a small occasion offered him by chance, which he did desire, and did it to his content, and to the House’s seeming to approve of it by their hum.

1666-10-03 23:10   Home, to set up all my folio books, which are come home gilt on the backs, very handsome to the eye.

1666-10-03 21:15   To White Hall, and there among the ladies, and saw my Lady Castlemaine never looked so ill, nor Mrs. Stewart neither, as in this plain, natural dress. I was not pleased with either of them.

1666-10-03 20:32 r They gone, and my heart eased of a great deale of fear and pain, and reckoning myself to come off with victory, because not overcome in anything or much foiled.

1666-10-03 20:09   To work again, only the Committee and I, till dark night, and by that time they cast up all the lists, and found out what the medium of men was borne all the war, of all sorts, and ended with good peace, and much seeming satisfaction.

1666-10-03 13:10   I have news brought me of my father’s coming to town, and I presently to him, glad to see him, poor man, he being come to town unexpectedly to see us and the city.

1666-10-03 11:45   Sir W. Batten, Lord Bruncker, Sir W. Pen, come in, but presently went out; and Sir J. Minnes come in, and said two or three words from the purpose, but to do hurt; and so away he went also, and left me all the morning with them alone to stand or fall.

1666-10-03 08:22   Birch calls me to work, and there he and I begun, when, by and by, comes Garraway, the first time I ever saw him, and Sir W. Thompson and Mr. Boscawen. They to it, and I did make shift to answer them better than I expected.

1666-10-03 06:10   So up, and with Mr. Hater and W. Hewer and Griffin to consider of our business, and books and papers necessary for this examination.

1666-10-03 05:30   Waked betimes, mightily troubled in mind, and in the most true trouble that I ever was in my life, saving in the business last year of the East India prizes.

1666-10-02 19:34 r I find Cocke, Griffin and the boy have found the housekeeper, and the book simply locked up in the Court. So I staid and drank, and rewarded the door-keeper, and away home, my heart lighter by all this.

1666-10-02 18:18 r I could not tell in the world what to do, but was mad on all sides, and that which made me worse Captain Cocke was there, and he did so swear and curse at the boy that told me.

1666-10-02 18:14   I to Sir W. Pen’s, to his boy, for my book, and there find he hath it not, but delivered it to the doorkeeper of the Committee for me. This, added to my former disquiet, made me stark mad, considering all the nakedness of the office lay open in papers within those covers.

1666-10-02 16:42 r They appointed me to attend a Committee of them tomorrow at the office to examine our lists. This put me into a mighty fear and trouble; they doing it in a very ill humour, methought.

1666-10-02 16:10   I into the Committee Chamber before the Committee sat, and there heard Birch discourse highly and understandingly about the Navy business and a proposal made heretofore to farm the Navy; but Sir W. Coventry did abundantly answer him, and is a most excellent person.

1666-10-02 14:47 r Mr. Slingsby tells me that the heightening or lowering of money is only a cheat, and do good to some particular men, which, if I can but remember how, I am now by him fully convinced of.

1666-10-02 14:32   With Sir W. Pen to White Hall, and do give his boy my book of papers to hold while he went into the Committee Chamber in the Inner Court of Wards, and I walked without with Mr. Slingsby, of the Tower, who was there.

1666-10-02 11:03   To an alehouse, and found Mr. Falconbridge, and agreed for his kinswoman to come to me. He says she can dress my wife, and will do anything we would have her to do, and is of a good spirit and mighty cheerful.

1666-10-02 09:40   I to White Hall to the House, and spoke to Sir W. Coventry, where he told me I must attend the Committee in the afternoon, and received some hints of more work to do.

1666-10-02 08:23   I am sent for to Sir G. Carteret, and to him, and there he tells me how our lists are referred to a Sub-committee to consider and examine, and that I am ordered to be there this afternoon.

1666-10-01 20:19   My wife do tell me that W. Hewer tells her that Mercer hath no mind to come. So I was angry at it, and resolved with her to have Falconbridge’s girl, and I think it will be better for us, and will please me better with singing.

1666-10-01 17:22 r But pretty, how I took another pretty woman for her, taking her a clap on the breech, thinking verily it had been her.

1666-10-01 17:20   To White Hall, and there did hear Betty Michell was at this end of the town, and so without breach of vow did stay to endeavour to meet with her and carry her home; but she did not come, so I lost my whole afternoon.

1666-10-01 14:04   Sir W. Coventry and I (the others going before the Committee) to Lord Bruncker’s for his hand, and find him simply mighty busy in a council of the Queen’s.

1666-10-01 11:58   All the morning at the office, getting the list of all the ships and vessels employed since the war, for the Committee of Parliament.
