1666-02-14 16:14 Lord! to see how afeard I was that Sir W. Coventry should have spied me once whispering with Sir G. Carteret, though not intended by me, but only Sir G. Carteret come to me and I could not avoid it.

1666-02-14 12:09 With Mr. Hill to his painter, Mr. Hales, who is drawing his picture, which will be mighty like him, and pleased me so, that I am resolved presently to have my wife’s and mine done by him, he having a very masterly hand.

1666-02-14 11:25 I took Mr. Hill to my Lord Chancellor’s new house that is building, and went with trouble up to the top of it, and there is there the noblest prospect that ever I saw in my life, Greenwich being nothing to it.

1666-02-14 09:10 I took occasion to bemoan myself that I should fall into such a difficulty about Sir G. Carteret, as not to be for him, but I must be against Sir W. Coventry, and therefore desired to be neutrall, which my Lord approved and confessed reasonable.

1666-02-14 09:04 My Lord Sandwich did give me hearty and large studied thanks for all my kindnesses to him and care of him and his business.

1666-02-14 07:08 Called up by Mr. Hill, who, my wife thought, had been come to be her Valentine; she, it seems, having drawn him last night, but it proved not.

1666-02-13 21:30 This day my wife wanting a chambermaid with much ado got our old little Jane to be found out, who come to see her and hath lived all this while in one place, but is so well that we will not desire her removal.

1666-02-13 19:58 Ill news this night that the plague is encreased this week, and in many places else about the town, and at Chatham and elsewhere.

1666-02-13 14:27 All the house melancholy upon the sickness of a daughter of the house in childbed, Mr. Vaughan’s lady.

1666-02-13 13:58 To the ’Change, and thence after business dined at the Sheriffe’s (Hooker), being carried by Mr. Lethulier, where to my heart’s content I met with his wife, a most beautiful fat woman.

1666-02-12 20:50 Home to supper, where Mr. Hill was and supped with us, and good discourse; an excellent person he still appears to me.

1666-02-12 19:06 To my bookseller’s, and then received some books I have new bought, and here late choosing some more to new bind, having resolved to give myself 10l. in books.

1666-02-12 11:05 Mr. Caesar hath been in Westminster all this while; and tells me in the height of the plague, how bold people were, to go in sport to one another’s burials; and in spite too, ill people would breathe in the faces (out of their windows) of well people going by.

1666-02-12 09:30 To several people attending upon business, among others Mr. Grant and the executors of Barlow for the 25l. due for the quarter before he died, which I scrupled to pay, being obliged but to pay every half year.

1666-02-12 08:03 Up, and very busy to perform an oath in finishing my Journall this morning for 7 or 8 days past.

1666-02-11 21:21 The great wound I had in my thumb having with once dressing by Mrs. Turner’s balsam been perfectly cured, whereas I did not hope to save my nail, whatever else ill it did give me.

1666-02-11 18:33 Yesterday come out the King’s Declaration of War against the French, but with such mild invitations of both them and the Dutch to come over hither with promise of their protection, that every body wonders at it.

1666-02-11 16:12 All of us much at a loss that we yet can hear nothing of Sir Jeremy Smith’s fleet, that went away to the Streights the middle of December, through all the storms that we have had since, that have driven back three or four of them with their masts by the board.

1666-02-11 06:30 Up, and put on a new black cloth suit to an old coat that I make to be in mourning at Court, where they are all, for the King of Spayne.

1666-02-10 22:20 To supper and to bed, being now-a-days, for these four or five months, mightily troubled with my snoring in my sleep, and know not how to remedy it.

1666-02-10 18:20 Being full of care and multitude of business, I took coach and my wife with me. I set her down at her mother’s, and I to the Exchequer about Tangier orders, and so to the Swan and there staid a little.

1666-02-10 14:05 To dinner. This day comes first Sir Thomas Harvy after the plague, having been out of town all this while. He was coldly received by us, and he went away before we rose also, to make himself appear yet a man less necessary.

1666-02-09 23:06 Here the five brothers Houblons were till about eleven at night with great pleasure, and a fine sight it is to see these five brothers thus loving one to another, and all industrious merchants.

1666-02-09 21:45 Anon the five brothers Houblons come and Mr. Hill, and a very good supper we had, and good company and discourse, with great pleasure. My new plate sets off my cupboard very nobly.

1666-02-09 16:09 Home, and there very much angry with my people till I had put all things in good forwardness about my supper for the Houblons, but that being done I was in good humour again, and all things in good order.

1666-02-09 14:15 To the ’Change, and to the Sun behind it to dinner with the Lieutenant of the Tower, Colonell Norwood and others, where strange pleasure they seem to take in their wine and meat, and discourse of it with the curiosity and joy that methinks was below men of worth.

1666-02-09 10:30 To Westminster, to the Exchequer, about my Tangier business to get orders for tallies, and so to the Hall, where the first day of the Terme, and the Hall very full of people, and much more than was expected, considering the plague that hath been.

1666-02-08 12:28 Expecting to have received from Mr. Houbland, as he promised me, an assignment, for my reward for my getting them the going of their two ships to Tangier, but I find myself much disappointed therein, for I spoke with him and he said nothing of it, but looked coldly.

1666-02-07 22:20 To supper, weary, and to bed, having had the plasterers and joiners also to do some jobbs.

1666-02-07 18:32 Interrupted I was by two or three occasions this day to my great vexation, having this the only day I have been able to set apart for this work since my coming to town.

1666-02-07 17:26 It was a sight frighted my wife, but I put some balsam of Mrs. Turner’s to it, and though in great pain yet went on with my business, and did it to my full content, setting every thing in order, in hopes now that the worst of our fears are over as to the plague for the next year.

1666-02-07 17:24 In the morning, doing of it, and knocking up a nail, I did bruise my left thumb so as broke a great deal of my flesh off, that it hung by a little.

1666-02-07 17:22 It being fast day I staid at home all day long to set things to rights in my chamber by taking out all my books, and putting my chamber in the same condition it was before the plague.

1666-02-06 18:33 To Viner’s, and sent home for the plate which my wife and I had a mind to change, and there changed it, about 50l. worth, into things more useful, whereby we shall now have a very handsome cupboard of plate.

1666-02-06 17:08 To White Hall because of a Committee for Tangier, where I did my business of stating my accounts perfectly well, and to good liking, and do not discern, but the Duke of Albemarle is my friend in his intentions notwithstanding my general fears.

1666-02-05 20:44 It raining, went directly to the Sun, behind the Exchange, where I find all the five brothers Houblons, and mighty fine gentlemen they are all, and used me mighty respectfully. We were mighty civilly merry, and their discourses, having been all abroad, very fine.

1666-02-05 10:04 My Lord Bruncker invited me to dinner to-day to dine with Sir W. Batten and his Lady there, who were invited before, but lest he should think so little an invitation would serve my turn I refused and parted.

1666-02-05 09:15 I saw Sir W. Batten’s Lady the first time since her coming to town since the plague, having absented myself designedly to shew some discontent, and that I am not at all the more suppliant because of my Lord Sandwich’s fall.

1666-02-04 20:36 At supper my wife tells me that W. Joyce has been with her this evening, the first time since the plague, and tells her my aunt James is lately dead of the stone, and what she had hath given to his and his brother’s wife and my cozen Sarah.

1666-02-04 09:10 It was a frost, and had snowed last night, which covered the graves in the churchyard, so as I was the less afeard for going through.

1666-02-04 08:55 My wife and I the first time together at church since the plague, and now only because of Mr. Mills his coming home to preach his first sermon; expecting a great excuse for his leaving the parish before any body went, and now staying till all are come home.

1666-02-03 23:40 I to my office, then about letters and other businesses very late, and so home to supper, weary with business, and to bed.

1666-02-03 20:05 To the office very busy till 3 o’clock, and then home, all of us, for half an hour to dinner, and to it again till eight at night, stating our wants of money for the Duke, but could not finish it.

1666-02-02 15:04 To the office, where we had a meeting extraordinary, about stating to the Duke the present debts of the Navy, for which ready money must be had.

1666-02-02 12:08 Home, and with my wife looked over our plate, and picked out 40l. worth, I believe, to change for more useful plate, to our great content, and then we shall have a very handsome cupboard of plate.

1666-02-02 11:22 I did call for my silver chafing dishes, but they are sent home, and the man would not be paid for them, saying that he was paid for them already, and with much ado got him to tell me by Mr. Wayth, but I would not accept of that, but will send him his money.

1666-02-02 10:58 I to London, and there among other things did look over some pictures at Cade’s for my house, and did carry home a silver drudger for my cupboard of plate.

1666-02-02 09:20 Knowing that my Lord Sandwich is come to town with the King and Duke, I to wait upon him, which I did, and find him in very good humour, which I am glad to see with all my heart.

1666-02-01 16:10 Thence to Sir Robert Viner’s, where I did the like, leaving clear in his hands just 2000l. of my own money, to be called for when I pleased.

1666-02-01 15:03 My Lord and his mistress, Madam Williams, set me down at the Exchange, and I to Alderman Backewell’s to set all my reckonings straight there, which I did, and took up all my notes.

1666-02-01 12:46 Hearing my wife was gone abroad to buy things and see her mother and father, whom she hath not seen since before the plague, and no dinner provided for me ready, I walked to Captain Cocke’s, knowing my Lord Bruncker dined there.
