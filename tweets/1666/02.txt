1666-02-28 21:50 And thus ends this month, with my mind full of resolution to apply myself better from this time forward to my business than I have done these six or eight days, visibly to my prejudice both in quiet of mind and setting backward of my business.

1666-02-28 18:08 To Mrs. Lane’s, and there lent her 5l. upon 4l. 01s. in gold. And then did what I would with her, and I perceive she is come to be very bad, and offers any thing that it is dangerous to have to do with her, nor will I see any more a good while.

1666-02-28 13:20 Home and there find Mrs. Knipp, and we dined together, she the pleasantest company in the world.

1666-02-28 11:16 Going out of Westminster Hall was called to by Mrs. Martin, so I went to her and bought two bands, and so parted, and by and by met at her chamber, and there did what I would.

1666-02-28 09:04 I went into the Parke, and meeting Sir Ph. Warwicke took a turn with him in the Pell Mall, talking of the melancholy posture of affairs, where every body is snarling one at another, and all things put together look ominously.

1666-02-27 14:27 My wife gone out to Hales’s about her picture, and, after dinner, I after her, and do mightily like her picture, and think it will be as good as my Lady Peters’s.

1666-02-26 22:08 I was waked with my wife’s quarrelling with Mercer, at which I was angry, and my wife and I fell out. But with much ado to sleep again, I beginning to practise more temper, and to give her her way.

1666-02-26 14:34 To the chappell, and there saw Sir H. Wotton’s stone with this Epitaph – “Hic Jacet primus hujus Sententiæ Author. Disputandi pruritus fit ecclesiæ scabies.” But unfortunately the word Author was wrong writ, and now so basely altered that it disgraces the stone.

1666-02-26 14:10 At Eton I left my wife in the coach, and the Doctor and I to the College, and there find all mighty fine. The school good, and the custom pretty of boys cutting their names in the struts of the window when they go to Cambridge.

1666-02-26 12:48 Lord! the prospect that is in the balcone in the Queen’s lodgings, and the terrace and walk, are strange things to consider, being the best in the world, sure.

1666-02-26 12:40 To the King’s house, and to observe the neatness and contrivance of the house and gates: it is the most romantique castle that is in the world.

1666-02-26 11:50 Was shown where the late King is buried, and King Henry the Eighth, and my Lady Seymour.

1666-02-26 11:04 To Windsor, and sent for Dr. Childe; who come to us, and carried us to St. George’s Chappel; and there placed us among the Knights’ stalls; and hither come cushions to us. And here, for our sakes, had this anthem and the great service sung extraordinary, only to entertain us.

1666-02-26 09:30 I do think myself obliged to think myself happy, and do look upon myself at this time in the happiest occasion a man can be, and whereas we take pains in expectation of future comfort and ease, I have taught myself to reflect upon myself at present as happy.

1666-02-26 09:10 I in, and my wife up and to visit my Lady Slaving in her bed, and there sat three hours, with Lady Jemimah with us, talking and laughing, and by and by my Lady Carteret comes, and she and I to talk, I glad to please her in discourse of Sir G. Carteret.

1666-02-26 06:18 Called up about five in the morning, and my Lord up, and took leave, a little after six, very kindly of me and the whole company.

1666-02-25 23:50 My Lord going away to write, the young gentlemen to flinging of cushions, and other mad sports; at this late, and then being sleepy, I and my wife in a passage-room to bed, and slept not very well because of noise.

1666-02-25 17:10 He says the Archbishopp of Canterbury hath plainly said that all the world knows the difference between his judgment and brains and the Duke of Albemarle’s, and then calls my Lady Duchess the veryest slut and drudge and the foulest word that can be spoke of a woman almost.

1666-02-25 16:58 He says also, if it should in Parliament be enquired into the selling of Dunkirke, yet he will be found to have been the greatest adviser of it; which he is a little apprehensive may be called upon this Parliament.

1666-02-25 16:39 He doubts it is needful for him to have a pardon for his last year’s actions, all which he did without commission, and at most but the King’s private single word for that of Bergen; but he dares not ask it at this time.

1666-02-25 16:28 He dreads the issue of this year, and fears there will be some very great revolutions before his coming back again.

1666-02-25 16:22 My Lord tells me my Lord of Suffolke, Lord Arlington, Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Treasurer, Mr. Atturny Montagu, Sir Thomas Clifford in the House of Commons, Sir G. Carteret, and some others I cannot presently remember, are friends that I may rely on for him.

1666-02-25 12:04 Here was my Lord, and Lord Hinchingbroke, and Mr. Sidney, Sir Charles Herbert, and Mr. Carteret, my Lady Carteret, my Lady Jemimah, and Lady Slaning.

1666-02-25 11:25 To Cranborne, and found my Lord and the ladies at a sermon in the house; which being ended we to them, and all the company glad to see us, and mighty merry to dinner.

1666-02-25 08:32 With our coach of four horses I hire on purpose, and Leshmore to ride by, we through the City to Branford and so to Windsor, Captain Ferrers overtaking us at Kensington, being to go with us, and here drank.

1666-02-25 06:02 My wife up between three and four of the clock in the morning to dress herself, and I about five, and were all ready to take coach, she and I and Mercer, a little past five, but, to our trouble, the coach did not come till six.

1666-02-24 17:58 Here we had ale and cakes and mighty merry, and sung my song, which Mrs. Knipp now sings bravely, and makes me proud of myself.

1666-02-24 17:27 I vexed at first to find my wife’s picture not so like as I expected; but it was only his having finished one part, and not another, of the face; but, before I went, I was satisfied it will be an excellent picture.

1666-02-24 17:07 Mr. Hill and I to Hales’s, where I find my wife and her woman, and Pierce and Knipp, and there sung and was mighty merry, and I joyed myself in it.

1666-02-23 22:32 Mightily pleased to find myself in condition to have these people come about me and to be able to entertain them, and have the pleasure of their qualities, than which no man can have more in the world.

1666-02-23 22:13 I supped, and was merry, and the rather it being my birthday, 33 years, for which God be praised that I am in so good a condition of health and state, and every thing else as I am, beyond expectation, in all.

1666-02-23 21:42 Mrs. Knipp also entertained me with repeating many of her own and others’ parts of the play-house, which she do most excellently; and tells me the whole practices of the play-house and players, and is in every respect most excellent company.

1666-02-23 21:20 Comes Mrs. Knipp to see my wife. I spent all the night talking with this baggage, and teaching her my song of “Beauty retire,” which she sings and makes go most rarely, and a very fine song it seems to be.

1666-02-23 09:20 But Mr. Hill’s picture never a whit so well as it did before it was finished, which troubled me, and I begin to doubt the picture of my Lady Peters my wife takes her posture from, and which is an excellent picture, is not of his making, it is so master-like.

1666-02-23 09:07 To Mr. Hales’s with Mr. Hill and two of the Houblons, who come thither to speak with me, and saw my wife’s picture, which pleases me well.

1666-02-23 07:10 The house full of people come to take leave of my Lord, who this day goes out of town upon his embassy towards Spayne.

1666-02-23 06:50 I walked (W. Howe with me) to my Lord Sandwich’s, who did lie the last night at his house in Lincoln’s Inne Fields. It being fine walking in the morning, and the streets full of people again.

1666-02-22 19:45 We are much troubled that the sickness in general (the town being so full of people) should be up by three, and yet of the particular disease of the plague there should be ten encrease.

1666-02-22 16:06 My wife to Mrs. Hunt’s, who is lately come to town and grown mighty fat.

1666-02-22 14:22 I alone stopped at Hales’s and there mightily am pleased with my wife’s picture that is begun there, and with Mr. Hill’s, though I must own I am not more pleased with it now the face is finished than I was when I saw it the second time of sitting.

1666-02-22 13:45 Home to dinner and thence by coach with my wife for ayre principally for her.

1666-02-21 16:58 Anon alone with me about the art of drawing pictures by Prince Rupert’s rule and machine, and another of Dr. Wren’s; but he says nothing do like squares, or, which is the best in the world, like a darke roome, which pleased me mightily.

1666-02-21 16:33 With my Lord Bruncker to Gresham College, the first time after the sickness that I was there, and the second time any met. And here a good lecture of Mr. Hooke’s about the trade of felt-making, very pretty.

1666-02-21 13:25 To Trinity-house, being invited to an Elder Brother’s feast; and there met and sat by Mr. Prin, and had good discourse about the privileges of Parliament, which, he says, are few to the Commons’ House, and those not examinable by them, but only by the House of Lords.

1666-02-21 08:40 With Sir J. Minnes to White Hall by his coach, by the way talking of my brother John to get a spiritual promotion for him, which I am now to look after, for as much as he is shortly to be Master in Arts.

1666-02-20 22:10 So to bed, a little troubled that I have been at two houses this afternoon with Mrs. Lane that were formerly shut up of the plague.

1666-02-20 19:30 Home, where little Mrs. Tooker staid with us, and a pretty child she is, and happens to be niece to my beauty that is dead, that lived at the Jackanapes, in Cheapside.

1666-02-20 17:50 We parted and rencontrais à her last logis, and in the place did hazer what I tena a mind para faire con her. At last she desired to borrow money of me, 5l, and would pawn gold with me for it, which I accepted and promised in a day or two to supply her.

1666-02-20 17:05 I away to Westminster Hall, and there hear that Mrs. Lane is come to town. So I staid loitering up and down till anon she comes and agreed to meet at Swayn’s, and there I went anon, and she come, but staid but little, the place not being private.

1666-02-20 14:55 By and by the child is brought and christened Katharine, and I this day on this occasion drank a glass of wine, which I have not professedly done these two years, I think, but a little in the time of the sickness.

1666-02-20 14:26 I to my Lord Sandwich’s, where I found Captain Ferrers going to christen a child of his born yesterday, and I come just pat to be a godfather, along with my Lord Hinchingbrooke, and Madam Pierce, my Valentine, which for that reason I was pretty well contented with.

1666-02-20 12:20 I took Mr. Evelyn home to dinner, being desirous of keeping my acquaintance with him; and a most excellent humoured man I still find him, and mighty knowing.

1666-02-19 17:28 It is confessed of all that the Queen miscarryed lately; Dr. Clerke telling me yesterday at White Hall that he had the membranes and other vessels in his hands which she voided, and were perfect as ever woman’s was that bore a child.

1666-02-19 17:16 To White Hall, and there saw the Queene at cards with many ladies, but none of our beauties were there. But glad I was to see the Queen so well, who looks prettily.

1666-02-19 14:57 I find my wife gone out to Hales, her painter’s, and I after a little dinner do follow her, and there do find him at work, and with great content I do see it will be a very rare picture.

1666-02-19 12:58 To the ’Change, and from my stationer’s thereabouts carried home by coach two books of Ogilby’s, his Æsop and Coronation, which fell to my lot at his lottery. Cost me 4l. besides the binding.

1666-02-19 12:35 By coach to St. Paul’s Church-yard to my Bookseller’s, and there bespoke a few more books to bring all I have lately bought to 10l.

1666-02-19 08:20 To my Lord Sandwich’s, to see my Lord Hinchingbroke, which I did, and I am mightily out of countenance in my great expectation of him by others’ report, though he is indeed a pretty gentleman, yet nothing what I took him for, either as to person or discourse discovered to me.

1666-02-18 17:32 Calling by the way at my bookseller’s for a book, writ about twenty years ago in prophecy of this year coming on, 1666, explaining it to be the mark of the beast, I home.

1666-02-18 16:06 Besides, an odd story lately told of Creed for a great truth, of his endeavouring to lie with a woman at Oxford, and her crying out saved her; and this being publicly known, doth a little make me hate him.

1666-02-18 16:03 Met with Creed and walked with him a turn or two in the Park, but without much content, having now designs of getting money in my head, which allow me not the leisure I used to have with him.

1666-02-18 15:32 It being a brave day, I walked to White Hall, where the Queene and ladies are all come: I saw some few of them, but not the Queen, nor any of the great beauties.

1666-02-18 12:05 Comes my uncle Wight to dinner, and brings with him Mrs. Wight, sad company to me, nor was I much pleased with it, only I must shew respect to my uncle.

1666-02-18 08:40 Lay long in bed discoursing with pleasure with my wife, among other things about Pall’s coming up, for she must be here a little to be fashioned, and my wife hath a mind to go down for her, which I am not much against.

1666-02-17 12:10 Up, and to the office, where busy all the morning.

1666-02-16 21:05 I walked a good while to-night with Mr. Hater in the garden, talking about a husband for my sister, and reckoning up all our clerks about us, none of which he thinks fit for her and her portion. At last I thought of young Gawden, and will think of it again.

1666-02-16 11:15 With Moore to the Coffee-House, the first time I have been there, where very full, and company it seems hath been there all the plague time.

1666-02-16 10:26 Mr. Moore tells me very odde passages of the indiscretion of my Lord in the management of his family, of his carelessness, &c., which troubles me, but makes me rejoice with all my heart of my being rid of the bond of 1000l, for that would have been a cruel blow to me.

1666-02-16 08:44 I to my Lord Sandwich, and there alone with him to talk of his affairs, and particularly of his prize goods, wherein I find he is wearied with being troubled.

1666-02-15 19:32 I to the office, whither the Houblons come telling me of a little new trouble from Norwood about their ship, which troubles me, though without reason.

1666-02-15 15:59 Strange how like Mr. Hales’ very first dead colouring is, that it did me good to see it, and pleases me mightily, and I believe will be a noble picture.

1666-02-15 14:30 While Mr. Hales painted, Knipp, and Mercer, and I, sang; and by and by comes Mrs. Pierce, with my name in her bosom for her Valentine, which will cost me money.

1666-02-15 13:20 With my wife and Knipp and Mercer (Mr. Hunt newly come out of the country being there also come to see us) to Mr. Hales, the painter’s, having set down Mr. Hunt by the way. Here Mr. Hales’ begun my wife in the posture we saw one of my Lady Peters, like a St. Katharine.

1666-02-15 12:10 To Starky’s, a great cook in Austin Friars, invited by Colonell Atkins, and a good dinner for Colonell Norwood and his friends, among others Sir Edward Spragg and others, but ill attendance.

1666-02-14 16:14 Lord! to see how afeard I was that Sir W. Coventry should have spied me once whispering with Sir G. Carteret, though not intended by me, but only Sir G. Carteret come to me and I could not avoid it.

1666-02-14 12:09 With Mr. Hill to his painter, Mr. Hales, who is drawing his picture, which will be mighty like him, and pleased me so, that I am resolved presently to have my wife’s and mine done by him, he having a very masterly hand.

1666-02-14 11:25 I took Mr. Hill to my Lord Chancellor’s new house that is building, and went with trouble up to the top of it, and there is there the noblest prospect that ever I saw in my life, Greenwich being nothing to it.

1666-02-14 09:10 I took occasion to bemoan myself that I should fall into such a difficulty about Sir G. Carteret, as not to be for him, but I must be against Sir W. Coventry, and therefore desired to be neutrall, which my Lord approved and confessed reasonable.

1666-02-14 09:04 My Lord Sandwich did give me hearty and large studied thanks for all my kindnesses to him and care of him and his business.

1666-02-14 07:08 Called up by Mr. Hill, who, my wife thought, had been come to be her Valentine; she, it seems, having drawn him last night, but it proved not.

1666-02-13 21:30 This day my wife wanting a chambermaid with much ado got our old little Jane to be found out, who come to see her and hath lived all this while in one place, but is so well that we will not desire her removal.

1666-02-13 19:58 Ill news this night that the plague is encreased this week, and in many places else about the town, and at Chatham and elsewhere.

1666-02-13 14:27 All the house melancholy upon the sickness of a daughter of the house in childbed, Mr. Vaughan’s lady.

1666-02-13 13:58 To the ’Change, and thence after business dined at the Sheriffe’s (Hooker), being carried by Mr. Lethulier, where to my heart’s content I met with his wife, a most beautiful fat woman.

1666-02-12 20:50 Home to supper, where Mr. Hill was and supped with us, and good discourse; an excellent person he still appears to me.

1666-02-12 19:06 To my bookseller’s, and then received some books I have new bought, and here late choosing some more to new bind, having resolved to give myself 10l. in books.

1666-02-12 11:05 Mr. Caesar hath been in Westminster all this while; and tells me in the height of the plague, how bold people were, to go in sport to one another’s burials; and in spite too, ill people would breathe in the faces (out of their windows) of well people going by.

1666-02-12 09:30 To several people attending upon business, among others Mr. Grant and the executors of Barlow for the 25l. due for the quarter before he died, which I scrupled to pay, being obliged but to pay every half year.

1666-02-12 08:03 Up, and very busy to perform an oath in finishing my Journall this morning for 7 or 8 days past.

1666-02-11 21:21 The great wound I had in my thumb having with once dressing by Mrs. Turner’s balsam been perfectly cured, whereas I did not hope to save my nail, whatever else ill it did give me.

1666-02-11 18:33 Yesterday come out the King’s Declaration of War against the French, but with such mild invitations of both them and the Dutch to come over hither with promise of their protection, that every body wonders at it.

1666-02-11 16:12 All of us much at a loss that we yet can hear nothing of Sir Jeremy Smith’s fleet, that went away to the Streights the middle of December, through all the storms that we have had since, that have driven back three or four of them with their masts by the board.

1666-02-11 06:30 Up, and put on a new black cloth suit to an old coat that I make to be in mourning at Court, where they are all, for the King of Spayne.

1666-02-10 22:20 To supper and to bed, being now-a-days, for these four or five months, mightily troubled with my snoring in my sleep, and know not how to remedy it.

1666-02-10 18:20 Being full of care and multitude of business, I took coach and my wife with me. I set her down at her mother’s, and I to the Exchequer about Tangier orders, and so to the Swan and there staid a little.

1666-02-10 14:05 To dinner. This day comes first Sir Thomas Harvy after the plague, having been out of town all this while. He was coldly received by us, and he went away before we rose also, to make himself appear yet a man less necessary.

1666-02-09 23:06 Here the five brothers Houblons were till about eleven at night with great pleasure, and a fine sight it is to see these five brothers thus loving one to another, and all industrious merchants.

1666-02-09 21:45 Anon the five brothers Houblons come and Mr. Hill, and a very good supper we had, and good company and discourse, with great pleasure. My new plate sets off my cupboard very nobly.

1666-02-09 16:09 Home, and there very much angry with my people till I had put all things in good forwardness about my supper for the Houblons, but that being done I was in good humour again, and all things in good order.

1666-02-09 14:15 To the ’Change, and to the Sun behind it to dinner with the Lieutenant of the Tower, Colonell Norwood and others, where strange pleasure they seem to take in their wine and meat, and discourse of it with the curiosity and joy that methinks was below men of worth.

1666-02-09 10:30 To Westminster, to the Exchequer, about my Tangier business to get orders for tallies, and so to the Hall, where the first day of the Terme, and the Hall very full of people, and much more than was expected, considering the plague that hath been.

1666-02-08 12:28 Expecting to have received from Mr. Houbland, as he promised me, an assignment, for my reward for my getting them the going of their two ships to Tangier, but I find myself much disappointed therein, for I spoke with him and he said nothing of it, but looked coldly.

1666-02-07 22:20 To supper, weary, and to bed, having had the plasterers and joiners also to do some jobbs.

1666-02-07 18:32 Interrupted I was by two or three occasions this day to my great vexation, having this the only day I have been able to set apart for this work since my coming to town.

1666-02-07 17:26 It was a sight frighted my wife, but I put some balsam of Mrs. Turner’s to it, and though in great pain yet went on with my business, and did it to my full content, setting every thing in order, in hopes now that the worst of our fears are over as to the plague for the next year.

1666-02-07 17:24 In the morning, doing of it, and knocking up a nail, I did bruise my left thumb so as broke a great deal of my flesh off, that it hung by a little.

1666-02-07 17:22 It being fast day I staid at home all day long to set things to rights in my chamber by taking out all my books, and putting my chamber in the same condition it was before the plague.

1666-02-06 18:33 To Viner’s, and sent home for the plate which my wife and I had a mind to change, and there changed it, about 50l. worth, into things more useful, whereby we shall now have a very handsome cupboard of plate.

1666-02-06 17:08 To White Hall because of a Committee for Tangier, where I did my business of stating my accounts perfectly well, and to good liking, and do not discern, but the Duke of Albemarle is my friend in his intentions notwithstanding my general fears.

1666-02-05 20:44 It raining, went directly to the Sun, behind the Exchange, where I find all the five brothers Houblons, and mighty fine gentlemen they are all, and used me mighty respectfully. We were mighty civilly merry, and their discourses, having been all abroad, very fine.

1666-02-05 10:04 My Lord Bruncker invited me to dinner to-day to dine with Sir W. Batten and his Lady there, who were invited before, but lest he should think so little an invitation would serve my turn I refused and parted.

1666-02-05 09:15 I saw Sir W. Batten’s Lady the first time since her coming to town since the plague, having absented myself designedly to shew some discontent, and that I am not at all the more suppliant because of my Lord Sandwich’s fall.

1666-02-04 20:36 At supper my wife tells me that W. Joyce has been with her this evening, the first time since the plague, and tells her my aunt James is lately dead of the stone, and what she had hath given to his and his brother’s wife and my cozen Sarah.

1666-02-04 09:10 It was a frost, and had snowed last night, which covered the graves in the churchyard, so as I was the less afeard for going through.

1666-02-04 08:55 My wife and I the first time together at church since the plague, and now only because of Mr. Mills his coming home to preach his first sermon; expecting a great excuse for his leaving the parish before any body went, and now staying till all are come home.

1666-02-03 23:40 I to my office, then about letters and other businesses very late, and so home to supper, weary with business, and to bed.

1666-02-03 20:05 To the office very busy till 3 o’clock, and then home, all of us, for half an hour to dinner, and to it again till eight at night, stating our wants of money for the Duke, but could not finish it.

1666-02-02 15:04 To the office, where we had a meeting extraordinary, about stating to the Duke the present debts of the Navy, for which ready money must be had.

1666-02-02 12:08 Home, and with my wife looked over our plate, and picked out 40l. worth, I believe, to change for more useful plate, to our great content, and then we shall have a very handsome cupboard of plate.
