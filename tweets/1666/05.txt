1666-05-17 22:14   Home to supper and to bed, mightily pleased with myself for the business that I have done, and convinced that if I would but keep constantly to do the same I might have leisure enough and yet do all my business, and by the grace of God so I will.

1666-05-17 17:05   To my office, where I could not hold my eyes open for an hour, but I drowsed (so little sensible I apprehend my soul is of the necessity of minding business), but I anon wakened and minded my business, and did a great deal with very great pleasure.

1666-05-16 22:05   I took my wife and Mrs. Barbary and Mercer out by coach and went our Grand Tour, and baited at Islington, and so late home about 11 at night, and so with much pleasure to bed.

1666-05-16 16:10   Lord! to see with what itching desire I did endeavour to see Bagwell’s wife, but failed, for which I am glad, only I observe the folly of my mind that cannot refrain from pleasure at a season above all others in my life requisite for me to shew my utmost care in.

1666-05-16 11:50 r I am very well satisfied in my pictures, and so took them in another coach home along with me, and there with great pleasure my wife and I hung them up.

1666-05-16 10:58   To Mr. Hales, and paid him for my picture, and Mr. Hill’s, for the first 14l. for the picture, and 25s. for the frame, and for the other 7l. for the picture, it being a copy of his only, and 5s. for the frame; in all, 22l. 10s.

1666-05-15 15:40   To my Lord Treasurer’s, and there my business was to be told that my Lord Treasurer hath got 10,000l. for us in the Navy, to answer our great necessities, which I did thank him for; but the sum is not considerable.

1666-05-14 21:55   I fell to examine my wife’s kitchen book, and find 20s. mistake, which made me mighty angry and great difference between us, and so in the difference to bed.

1666-05-14 19:20   Out with my wife and my aunt Wight, to take the ayre, and happened to have a pleasant race between our hackney-coach and a gentleman’s. At Bow we eat and drank and so back again, it being very cool. 

1666-05-14 10:44   Toward Westminster with my wife by coach and meeting took up Mr. Lovett the varnisher with us, who is a pleasant speaking and humoured man, so my wife much taken with him, and a good deal of work I believe I shall procure him.

1666-05-14 09:30   I finding it a leisure day fell to making clean my closet in my office, which I did to my content and set up my Platts again, being much taken also with Griffin’s maid, that did clean it, being a pretty maid.

1666-05-13 12:15   Home, where comes Mr. Symons to dine with me, and I made myself as good company as I could to him, but he was mighty impertinent methought too yet, and thereby I see the difference between myself now and what it was heretofore, when I reckoned him a very brave fellow.

1666-05-12 21:55   The plague encreases in many places, and is 53 this week with us.

1666-05-12 20:30   This day come home again my little girle Susan, her sickness proving an ague, and she had a fit soon almost as she come home.

1666-05-12 13:40   Up to the putting our dining room in order, which will be clean again anon, but not as it is to be because of the pictures which are not come home.

1666-05-12 12:08 r This my wife took unkindly, and I think I was to blame indeed; but she do find with reason, that in the company of Pierce, Knipp, or other women that I love, I do not value her, or mind her as I ought.

1666-05-12 12:05   Home, where I find my wife troubled still at my checking her last night in the coach in her long stories out of Grand Cyrus, which she would tell, though nothing to the purpose, nor in any good manner.

1666-05-12 05:50   Up to the office very betimes to draw up a letter for the Duke of Yorke relating to him the badness of our condition in this office for want of money.

1666-05-11 21:48   Abroad with my wife and Mrs. Pierce, our long tour by coach, to Hackney, so to Kingsland, and then to Islington, there entertaining them by candlelight very well.

1666-05-11 10:55   Captain Cocke told me that my Lord Bruncker should say in his hearing, before Sir W. Batten, of me, that he could undo the man, if he would; wherein I think he is a foole; but, however, it is requisite I be prepared against the man’s friendship.

1666-05-10 22:10   So back again late, it being wondrous hot all the day and night and it lightning exceeding all the way we went and came, but without thunder.

1666-05-10 21:20 r Coming home we called at a little ale-house, and had an eele-pie, of which my wife eat part and brought home the rest.

1666-05-10 19:37 r Going out towards Hackney by coach for the ayre, the silly coachman carries us to Shoreditch, which was so pleasant a piece of simplicity in him and us, that made us mighty merry.

1666-05-10 18:43   Abroad with my wife by coach. We took with us Mrs. Turner, who was come to visit my wife just as we were going out. A great deal of tittle tattle discourse to little purpose, though in other things a very discreet woman, as very a gossip speaking of her neighbours as any body.

1666-05-09 22:20 r I rose and held my wife, she prays me to forgive her, and in mighty pain we put her to bed, where the pain ceased by and by, and so had some asparagus to our bed side for supper and very kindly afterward to sleep.

1666-05-09 21:32 r Half an hour after (my wife in the coach leaning on me as being desirous to be friends) she comes up mighty sick with a fit of the cholique and in mighty pain and calls for me out of the bed.

1666-05-09 20:59 r I left my company and went with my wife to Bow, but was vexed and spoke not one word to her all the way going nor coming, or being come home, but went up straight to bed.

1666-05-09 18:50 r Home, where my wife in mighty pain and mightily vexed at my being abroad with these women; and when they were gone called them whores and I know not what, which vexed me, having been so innocent with them.

1666-05-09 16:33   To Mrs Pierce’s, where I find Knipp, and I took them to Hales’s to see our pictures finished, which are very pretty, but I like not hers half so well as I thought at first, it being not so like, nor so well painted as I expected, or as mine and my wife’s are.

1666-05-09 08:58   By coach to White Hall, where we did our usual business before the Duke, and heard the Duke commend Deane’s ship “The Rupert” before “The Defyance,” built lately by Castle, in hearing of Sir W. Batten, which pleased me mightily.

1666-05-09 05:32   Up by five o’clock, which I have not a long time done, and down the river by water to Deptford, among other things to examine the state of Ironworke.

1666-05-08 22:39   To my office again late, and then home to supper to a good lobster with my wife, and then a little to my office again, and so to bed.

1666-05-08 15:10   To the office and thither comes Mr. Downing, the anchor-smith, who had given me 50 pieces in gold the last month to speak for him to Sir W. Coventry, for his being smith at Deptford; but he finds himself not fit to go on with it, so lets it fall.

1666-05-07 23:04   To the office, where busy till late at night and so weary and a little conscious of my failures to-day, yet proud that the day is over without more observation on Sir W. Coventry’s part, and so to bed and to sleep soundly.

1666-05-07 10:10   I went with Sir W. Coventry into the Victualling office, where we sat and examined his businesses and state of the victualling of the fleet, which made me in my heart blush that I could say no more to it than I did or could.

1666-05-06 20:45   Busy till night in fitting my Victualling papers in order, which I through my multitude of business and pleasure have not examined these several months. 

1666-05-05 23:58   It being a fine moonshine my wife and Mercer come into the garden, and, my business being done, we sang, with mighty pleasure to ourselves and neighbours, by their casements opening, and so home to supper and to bed.

1666-05-04 21:10   Bkeing weary of my late idle courses, and the little good I shall do the King or myself in the office, I bound myself to very strict rules till Whitsunday next.

1666-05-04 13:12   To dinner, and had a great fray with my wife again about Browne’s coming to teach her to paint, and sitting with me at table, which I will not yield to.

1666-05-04 09:33   To Mr. Hales, to see what he had done to Mrs. Pierces picture, and whatever he pretends, I do not think it will ever be so good a picture as my wife’s.

1666-05-03 19:22 r The mother come and with a nurse she has got, who demanded and I did agree at 10s. per week to take her, and so she away, and my house mighty uncouth, having so few in it.

1666-05-03 14:10 r I sent for the girl’s mother to Westminster Hall to me; she came and undertakes to get her daughter a lodging and nurse at next door to her, though she dare not, for the parish’s sake, whose sexton her husband is, to take her into her own house.

1666-05-03 13:15 r To send up and down for a nurse to take the girle home and would have given anything. I offered to the only one that we could get 20s. per week, and we to find clothes, and bedding and physique, and would have given 30s, as demanded, but desired an hour or two’s time.

1666-05-03 12:05   Home, and contrary to my expectation find my little girl Su worse than she was, which troubled me, and the more to see my wife minding her painting and not thinking of her house business.

1666-05-02 12:50   I home to dinner, find the girl yet better, so no fear of being forced to send her out of doors as we intended.

1666-05-02 10:04   To my office, to consult about serving Captain Cocke in getting him some money, he being already tired of his slavery to my Lord Bruncker, and the charge it costs him, and gets no manner of courtesy from him for it. 

1666-05-01 19:59   My wife tells me the ill news that our Susan is sick and gone to bed, with great pain in her head and back, which troubles us all. However we to bed expecting what to-morrow would produce. She hath we conceive wrought a little too much, having neither maid nor girl to help her.

1666-05-01 15:50   By water to Redriffe, reading a new French book my Lord Bruncker did give me to-day, “L’Histoire Amoureuse des Gaules,” being a pretty libel against the amours of the Court of France.

1666-05-01 12:41 r However, I did bring him to incline towards it, if he be pressed to take it. I do think it may be some repute to me to have my kinsman in Commission there, specially if he behave himself to content in the country.

1666-05-01 12:39 r Nor do he understand Latin, and so is not capable of the place as formerly, now all warrants do run in Latin. Nor is he in Kent, though he be of Deptford parish, his house standing in Surry.

1666-05-01 12:35   My cozen Thomas Pepys did come to me, to consult about the business of his being a justice of the Peace, which he is much against; and among other reasons, tells me, that he is not free to exercise punishment according to the Act against Quakers and other people, for religion.
