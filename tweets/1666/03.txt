1666-03-31 01:04 And so to bed, with my head full of thoughts for my evening of all my accounts tomorrow, the latter end of the month, in which God give me good issue, for I never was in such a confusion in my life and that in great sums.

1666-03-30 19:48 To Hales’s, and there sat till almost quite dark upon working my gowne, which I hired to be drawn in; an Indian gown, and I do see all the reason to expect a most excellent picture of it.

1666-03-30 11:04 Sir W. Warren come to me a second time about having 2000l. of me upon his bills on the Act to enable him to pay for the ships he is buying, wherein I shall have considerable profit.

1666-03-30 09:40 I out to Lumbard Street, and there received 2200l. and brought it home; and, contrary to expectation, received 35l. for the use of 2000l. of it a quarter of a year, where it hath produced me this profit.

1666-03-30 07:05 So we shall take another girl and make little Jane our cooke, at least, make a trial of it.

1666-03-30 07:03 Away goes Alce, our cook-maid, a good servant, whom we loved and did well by her, and she an excellent servant, but would not bear being told of any fault in the fewest and kindest words and would go away of her own accord.

1666-03-29 23:23 This day, poor Jane, my old, little Jane, came to us again, to my wife’s and my great content, and we hope to take mighty pleasure in her, she having all the qualities of a good and loving and honest servant, her mistress having used all the stratagems she could to keep her.

1666-03-29 14:15 To Lumbard Streete, to look after the getting of some money that is lodged there of mine in Viner’s hands, I having no mind to have it lie there longer.

1666-03-28 23:57 This night, I am told, the Queen of Portugall, the mother to our Queen, is lately dead, and news brought of it hither this day.

1666-03-28 16:22 To Hales’s, and there sat again, and it is become mighty like. Hither come my wife and Mercer brought by Mrs. Pierce and Knipp, we were mighty merry and the picture goes on the better for it.

1666-03-28 13:35 To the Cockpitt, and dined with a great deal of company at the Duke of Albemarle’s, and a bad and dirty, nasty dinner.

1666-03-28 10:05 I walked with Sir W. Clerke into St. James’s Park, and by and by met with Mr. Hayes, Prince Rupert’s Secretary, who are mighty, both, brisk blades, but I fear they promise themselves more than they expect.

1666-03-27 23:49 To my public accounts of Tangier, which it is strange by meddling with evening reckonings how I myself am become intangled therein, so that after all I could do, ready to break my head and brains, I thought of another way, the only one which this account is capable of.

1666-03-26 23:17 Home a little to my accounts public and private, but could not get myself rightly to know how to dispose of them in order to passing.

1666-03-26 11:27 My Lord Bruncker and I to the Tower, to see the famous engraver, to get him to grave a seal for the office. And did see some of the finest pieces of work in embossed work, that ever I did see in my life, for fineness and smallness of the images thereon.

1666-03-26 09:10 A meeting extraordinary there was of Sir W. Coventry, Lord Bruncker, and myself, about the business of settling the ticket office, where infinite room is left for abusing the King in the wages of seamen.

1666-03-26 01:05 To my papers and Tangier accounts, but by my mixing them, my private and public accounts, it makes me mad to see how hard it is to bring them to be understood, and my head is confounded, for I cannot understand what I do or have been doing of them to-day.

1666-03-25 12:07 To dinner, where my wife’s brother, whom I sent for to offer making him a Muster-Master and send to sea, which the poor man likes well of and will go, and it will be a good preferment to him, only hazardous.

1666-03-24 15:59 I was well pleased to see that there was nothing near so much resemblance of the Duchesse’s face in Lilly’s work, which is now the second, if not the third time, as there was of my wife’s at the very first time.

1666-03-24 15:55 After the Committee for Tangier up, I had occasion to follow the Duke into his lodgings, into a chamber where the Duchesse was sitting to have her picture drawn by Lilly, who was there at work.

1666-03-24 12:27 Home to dinner, where Anthony Joyce, and I did give my final answer, I would give but 500l. with my sister, and did show him the good offer made us in the country, to which I did now more and more incline, and intend to pursue that.

1666-03-23 18:10 To Anthony Joyce to receive Harman’s answer, which did trouble me to receive, for he now demands 800l, whereas he never made exception at the portion, but accepted of 500l. This I do not like; but, however, I cannot much blame the man.

1666-03-23 16:06 I am mighty glad of this match, and more that they are likely to live near me in Thames Street, where I may see Betty now and then, whom I from a girl did use to call my second wife, and mighty pretty she is.

1666-03-23 16:04 To Westminster Hall, and there Mrs. Michell tells me with great joy how little Betty Howlett is married to her young son Michell, which is a pretty odd thing, that he should so soon succeed in the match to his elder brother that died of the plague.

1666-03-23 13:20 Anon comes my wife and Mercer and little Tooker, and having done with me we all to a picture drawer’s hard by, Hales carrying me to see some landskip of a man’s doing. But I do not like any of them.

1666-03-23 12:05 I out by six o’clock by appointment to Hales’s, where we fell to my picture presently very hard, and it comes on a very fine picture, and very merry, pleasant discourse we had all the morning while he was painting.

1666-03-22 21:32 The plague increased four this week, which troubles me, though but one in the whole City.

1666-03-21 22:03 I to bed, troubled a little at a letter from my father, telling me how he is like to be sued for a debt of Tom’s, by Smith, the mercer.

1666-03-21 09:50 Sir Robert Long told us of the plenty of partridges in France, where he says the King of France and his company killed with their guns, in the plain de Versailles, 300 and odd partridges at one bout.

1666-03-20 14:28 I sat again, and had a great deal done, but, whatever the matter is, I do not fancy that it has the ayre of my face, though it will be a very fine picture.

1666-03-20 13:07 I by coach to Hales’s, where I find my wife’s picture now perfectly finished in all respects, and a beautiful picture it is, as almost I ever saw.

1666-03-19 18:57 He is kinsman to, and lives with, Mr. Phillips, but my wife tells me he is a drunken, ill-favoured, ill-bred country fellow, which sets me off of it again, and I will go on with Harman.

1666-03-19 18:55 By letter from my father he propounds a match in the country for Pall, which pleased me well, of one that hath seven score and odd pounds land per annum in possession, and expects 1000l. in money by the death of an old aunt.

1666-03-19 14:44 But then again, to think how fine they show on the stage by candle-light, and how poor things they are to look now too near hand, is not pleasant at all.

1666-03-19 14:42 But to see their clothes, and the various sorts, and what a mixture of things there was; here a wooden-leg, there a ruff, here a hobbyhorse, there a crown, would make a man split himself to see with laughing.

1666-03-19 14:40 My business here was to see the inside of the stage and all the tiring-rooms and machines; and, indeed, it was a sight worthy seeing.

1666-03-19 14:38 After dinner we walked to the King’s play-house, all in dirt, they being altering of the stage to make it wider. But God knows when they will begin to act again.

1666-03-19 11:46 My Lord Bruncker and I to Mrs. Williams’s, and there I saw her closet, where indeed a great many fine things there are, but the woman I hate.

1666-03-19 07:39 Up betimes and upon a meeting extraordinary at the office most of the morning with Lord Bruncker, Sir W. Coventry, and Sir W. Pen, upon the business of the accounts.

1666-03-18 19:06 Sir Christopher Mings is come home from Hambrough without anything done, saving bringing home some pipestaves for us.

1666-03-18 14:58 To Mrs. Martin’s, and did what I would with her; her husband going for some wine for us. The poor man I do think would take pains if I can get him a purser’s place, which I will endeavour.

1666-03-17 19:10 Home having a great cold, and so my wife and Mrs. Barbary have very great ones, we are at a loss how we all come by it together, so to bed, drinking butter-ale.

1666-03-17 15:28 This day I begun to sit, and Hales will make me, I think, a very fine picture. He promises it shall be as good as my wife’s, and I sit to have it full of shadows, and do almost break my neck looking over my shoulder to make the posture for him to work by.

1666-03-17 14:20 With my wife out to Hales’s, where I am still infinitely pleased with my wife’s picture. I paid him 14l. for it, and 25s. for the frame, and I think it is not a whit too dear for so good a picture. It is not yet quite finished and dry, so as to be fit to bring home yet.

1666-03-17 10:48 W. Hewer comes from Portsmouth and gives me an instance of another piece of knavery of Sir W. Pen, who wrote to Commissioner Middleton that it was my negligence the other day he was not acquainted with our clerks coming down to the pay.

1666-03-16 13:32 To the Crowne behind the ’Change and dined with my Lord Bruncker and Captain Cocke and Fenn, and Madam Williams, who without question must be my Lord’s wife, and else she could not follow him wherever he goes and kiss and use him publicly as she do.

1666-03-15 18:09 To Hales’s, where I met my wife and people; and do find the picture, above all things, a most pretty picture, and mighty like my wife; and I asked him his price: he says 14l, and the truth is, I think he do deserve it.

1666-03-15 16:59 Anthony Joyce and I to Harman’s house, and we to discourse of our business, and I offered 500l, and he declares most ingenuously that his trade is not to be trusted on, that he however needs no money, but would have Pall’s money bestowed on her, which I like well.

1666-03-15 16:04 I and my cozen Anthony Joyce, who come on purpose to dinner with me, and he and I to discourse of our proposition of marriage between Pall and Harman.

1666-03-14 19:32 It growing dark, took two or three wanton turns about the idle places and lanes about Drury Lane, but to no satisfaction, but a great fear of the plague among them.

1666-03-14 16:08 To Hales’s, to see my wife’s picture, which I like mighty well, and there had the pleasure to see how suddenly he draws the Heavens, laying a dark ground and then lightening it when and where he will.

1666-03-14 13:40 I having many things in my head rose, when my belly was full, though the dinner not half done, and home and there to do some business.

1666-03-14 13:27 I to Trinity house to dinner, where Captain Cox made his Elder Brother’s dinner. But it seemed to me a very poor sorry dinner.

1666-03-13 19:21 The plague encreased this week 29 from 28, though the total fallen from 238 to 207, which do never a whit please me.

1666-03-13 11:49 To the office, where busy sitting all the morning, and I begin to find a little convenience by holding up my head to Sir W. Pen, for he is come to be more supple.

1666-03-12 21:17 I hear my Uncle Talbot Pepys died the last week, and was buried.

1666-03-12 15:04 After dinner comes my uncle and aunt Wight, the latter I have not seen since the plague; a silly, froward, ugly woman she is. We made mighty much of them, and she talks mightily of her fear of the sickness, and so a deal of tittle tattle.

1666-03-12 11:07 To the Old Exchange, and there did much business, and so homeward and bought a silver salt for my ordinary table to use.

1666-03-12 07:57 Up betimes, and called on by abundance of people about business.

1666-03-11 08:38 By water to White Hall, there met Mr. Coventry coming out, going along with the Commissioners of the Ordnance to the water side to take barge, they being to go down to the Hope.

1666-03-10 21:32 Most men that do thrive in the world, do forget to take pleasure during the time that they are getting their estate, but reserve that till they have got one, and then it is too late for them to enjoy it with any pleasure.

1666-03-10 21:30 I do indulge myself a little the more in pleasure, knowing that this is the proper age of my life to do it.

1666-03-10 16:34 To Hales’s to have seen our pictures, but could not get in, he being abroad, and so to the Cakehouse hard by, and there sat in the coach with great pleasure, and eat some fine cakes.

1666-03-10 15:12 I carried my wife out by coach to the New Exchange, and there I did give my valentine, Mrs. Pierce, a dozen pair of gloves, and a pair of silk stockings, and Knipp for company’s sake, though my wife had, by my consent, laid out 20s. upon her the other day, six pair of gloves.

1666-03-09 21:12 Musique and women I cannot but give way to, whatever my business is.

1666-03-09 21:08 To Sir W. Batten’s and there Mrs. Knipp coming we did spend the evening together very merry. She and I singing, and, God forgive me! I do still see that my nature is not to be quite conquered, but will esteem pleasure above all things.

1666-03-09 14:04 To Castle’s house, where my Lady Batten and Madam Williams were, and there dined and a deal of doings. I had a good dinner and counterfeit mirth and pleasure with them, but had but little, thinking how I neglected my business.

1666-03-09 11:32 To Deptford, where I met my Lord Bruncker and Sir W. Batten by agreement, and to measuring Mr. Castle’s new third-rate ship, which is to be called the Defyance. I had my end in saving the King some money and getting myself some experience in knowing how they do measure ships.

1666-03-09 09:10 To the Cockpitt to make a visit to the Duke of Albemarle, and to my great joy find him the same man to me that heretofore, which I was in great doubt of, through my negligence in not visiting of him a great while.

1666-03-08 15:06 To Hales’s, where my wife is sitting; and, indeed, her face and neck, which are now finished, do so please me that I am not myself almost, in consideration of the fine picture that I shall be master of.

1666-03-08 13:18 To the White Horse in Lumbard Street to dine with Captain Cocke, and here by chance I saw the mistress of the house I have heard much of, and a very pretty woman she is indeed and her husband the simplest looked fellow and old that ever I saw.

1666-03-08 12:03 To the office, where all the morning sitting and did discover three or four fresh instances of Sir W. Pen’s old cheating dissembling tricks, he being as false a fellow as ever was born.

1666-03-07 22:25 The King and Duke are to go to-morrow to Audly End, in order to the seeing and buying of it of my Lord Suffolke.

1666-03-07 22:19 I home, and to writing and hear my boy play on the lute, and a turn with my wife pleasantly in the garden by moonshine, my heart being in great peace, and so home to supper and to bed.

1666-03-07 13:49 I took water, being invited, and down to Greenwich, to Captain Cocke’s, where dined, he and Lord Bruncker, and Matt. Wren, Boltele, and Major Cooper, who is also a very pretty companion; but they all drink hard, and, after dinner, to gaming at cards.

1666-03-07 09:48 All this discourse did cheer my heart, and sets me right again, after a good deal of melancholy, out of fears of his disinclination to me, upon the differences with my Lord Sandwich and Sir G. Carteret.

1666-03-07 09:32 When I said I was jealous of myself, that having come to such an income as I am, by Mr. Coventry’s favour, I should not be found to do as much service as might deserve it; he did assure me he thinks it not too much for me, but thinks I deserve it as much as any man in England.

1666-03-06 22:04 My mind troubled through a doubtfulness of my having incurred Sir W. Coventry’s displeasure by not having waited on him since his coming to town, which is a mighty fault and that I can bear the fear of the bad effects of till I have been with him, which shall be to-morrow.

1666-03-06 19:25 There being also Captain Cocke and Mrs. Turner, who had never been in my house since I come to the office before, and Mrs. Carcasse, wife of Mr. Carcasse’s. My house happened to be mighty clean, and did me great honour, and they mightily pleased with it.

1666-03-06 19:04 At Sir W. Batten’s I find my Lord Bruncker and Mrs. Williams, and they would of their own accord go see my house and my wife; which I showed them and made them welcome with wine and China oranges (now a great rarity since the war, none to be had).

1666-03-05 09:40 Colvill and I did end all our businesses together of accounts for money upon bills of Exchange, and am pleased to find myself reputed a man of business and method, as he do give me out to be.

1666-03-05 02:03 To bed with great joy and content that I have brought my things to so good a settlement, and now having my mind fixed to follow my business again.

1666-03-04 23:48 I am, I think, by all appears to me (and I am sure I cannot be 10l. wrong), worth above 4600l, for which the Lord be praised! being the biggest sum I ever was worth yet.

1666-03-04 23:18 All day at my Tangier and private accounts, having neglected them since Christmas, which I hope I shall never do again; for I find the inconvenience of it, it being ten times the labour to remember and settle things.

1666-03-03 16:15 To Hales’s, and there saw my wife sit; and I do like her picture mightily, and very like it will be, and a brave piece of work. But he do complain that her nose hath cost him as much work as another’s face, and he hath done it finely indeed.

1666-03-03 14:33 Sir W. Pen did give me the reason in my eare of his importunity for money, for that he is now to marry his daughter. God send her better fortune than her father deserves I should wish him for a false rogue.

1666-03-02 20:22 I am heartily sorry for Mr. Hill’s leaving us, for he is a very worthy gentleman, as most I know. God give him a good voyage and success in his business.

1666-03-02 19:37 Mr. James Houbland told me in my eare what he and his brothers have resolved to give me, which is 200l, for helping them out with two or three ships. A good sum and that which I did believe they would give me, and I did expect little less.

1666-03-02 18:05 By coach calling at my bookseller’s and carried home 10l. worth of books, all, I hope, I shall buy a great while.

1666-03-02 16:56 To my Lord Treasurer’s and thence to Sir Philip Warwicke’s new house by appointment. He shewed me his house, which is yet all unhung, but will be a very noble house indeed.

1666-03-02 07:49 Setting my wife and Mercer with much pleasure to work upon the ruling of some paper for the making of books for pursers, which will require a great deal of work and they will earn a good deal of money by it, the hopes of which makes them work mighty hard.

1666-03-01 23:57 Home and there close to my business at my office till twelve at night, having with great comfort returned to my business by some fresh vows in addition to my former, and-more severe, and a great joy it is to me to see myself in a good disposition to business.

1666-03-01 13:25 Blessed be God! a good Bill this week we have; being but 237 in all, and 42 of the plague, and of them but six in the City.

1666-03-01 12:40 At the White Horse in Lumbard Street, where, God forgive us! good sport with Captain Cocke’s having his maid sick of the plague a day or two ago and sent to the pest house, where she now is, but he will not say anything but that she is well.
