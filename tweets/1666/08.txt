1666-08-31 21:01   Much pleased to-day with thoughts of gilding the backs of all my books alike in my new presses.

1666-08-31 15:09   The boy and I to the office, and there he read while I writ the letter fair, which done I sent it to Sir W. Coventry to peruse and send to the fleet by the first opportunity.

1666-08-31 11:12   I got Mr. Poynter to enter into my book while I read from my last night’s notes the letter, and that being done to writing it fair.

1666-08-31 06:58   Up again at 6 to go by appointment to my Lord Bellasses, but he out of town, which vexed me.

1666-08-31 02:04   Till two in the morning framing my great letter to Mr. Hayes about the victualling of the fleet, about which there has been so much ado and exceptions taken by the Generals.

1666-08-30 12:06   Up and all the morning at the office.

1666-08-29 22:05   No news where the Dutch are. We begin to think they will steal through the Channel to meet Beaufort. We think our fleet sailed yesterday, but we have no news of it.

1666-08-29 17:38   I home, and there find Mrs. Mary Batelier, and she dined with us; and thence I took them to Islington, and there eat a custard; and so back to Moorfields, and shewed Batelier, with my wife, “Polichinello,” which I like the more I see it.

1666-08-29 10:47   Sir W. Coventry took Sir W. Pen and me apart, and read to us his answer to the Generals’ letter to the King that he read last night; wherein he is very plain, and states the matter in full defence of himself and of me, which he could not avoid; which is a good comfort to me.

1666-08-29 09:10   Sir W. Pen telling me that Mr. Norton, that married Sir J. Lawson’s daughter, is dead. She left 800l. a year jointure, a son to inherit the whole estate. She freed from her father-in-law’s tyranny, and is in condition to help her mother, who needs it.

1666-08-28 18:14 r I did give a good account of matters according to our computation of the expence of the fleet. I find Sir W. Coventry willing enough to accept of any thing to confront the Generals.

1666-08-28 18:02   Sir William Coventry did read me a letter from the Generals to the King, a most scurvy letter, reflecting most upon Sir W. Coventry, and then upon me, and then of the whole office, in neglecting them and the King’s service, and this in very plain and sharp and menacing terms.

1666-08-28 12:08   I, with my wife and Mercer, to Philpott Lane, a great cook’s shop, to the wedding of Mr. Longracke, our purveyor, a good, sober, civil man, and hath married a sober, serious mayde.

1666-08-27 11:05   To the office, and then home about one thing or other, about my new closet, for my mind is full of nothing but that.

1666-08-27 09:03   To break open a window, to the leads’ side in my old closet, which will enlighten the room mightily, and make it mighty pleasant.

1666-08-26 19:34   Being come home, I hear that Sir J. Minnes has had a very bad fit all this day, and a hickup do take him, which is a very bad sign, which troubles me truly.

1666-08-26 17:50 r I was in pain, after we come out, to know how I had done; and hear well enough. But, however, it shall be a caution to me to prepare myself against a day of inquisition.

1666-08-26 17:32 r I did in a long discourse tell the King and the rest (the Duke of York, Lord Chancellor, Lord Treasurer, both the Secretarys, Sir G. Carteret, and Sir W. Coventry) how it stood, wherein they seemed satisfied, but press mightily for more supplies.

1666-08-26 17:02   Sir W. Pen and I by coach to White Hall, and there staid till the King and Cabinet were met in the Green Chamber, and then we were called in; and there the King begun with me, to hear how the victualls of the fleet stood.

1666-08-26 14:48   I to my office, whither I sent for Mr. Lewes and instructed myself fully in the business of the Victualling, to enable me to answer in the matter.

1666-08-26 09:32   To the finishing the setting things in order in my new closet out of my old, which I did thoroughly by the time sermon was done at church, to my exceeding joy.

1666-08-25 15:28   After dinner up to my new closet, which pleases me mightily, and there I proceeded to put many things in order as far as I had time, and then set it in washing, and stood by myself a great while to see it washed.

1666-08-24 20:10   All the afternoon till it was quite dark hanging things, that is my maps and pictures and draughts, and setting up my books, and as much as we could do, to my most extraordinary satisfaction.

1666-08-24 11:03   I dispatched several businesses at home in the morning, and then comes Sympson to set up my other new presses for my books, and so he and I fell in to the furnishing of my new closet.

1666-08-23 13:28   Lovett do not please me in his business, for he keeps things long in hand, and his paper do not hold so good as I expected — the varnish wiping off in a little time — a very sponge; and I doubt by his discourse he is an odde kind of fellow, and, in plain terms, a very rogue.

1666-08-23 12:12 r But, Lord! to see how my Lord Bruncker undertakes the despatch of the fire-ships, when he is no more fit for it than a porter; and all the while Sir W. Pen, who is the most fit, is unwilling to displease him, and do not look after it.

1666-08-23 11:58   At the office all the morning, whither Sir W. Coventry sent me word that the Dutch fleet is certainly abroad; and so we are to hasten all we have to send to our fleet with all speed.

1666-08-22 20:40   Home, and there find Reeves, and so up to look upon the stars, and do like my glass very well, and did even with him for it and a little perspective and the Lanthorne that shows tricks, altogether costing me 9l. 5s. 0d.

1666-08-22 14:38   My closet is doing by upholsters, which I am pleased with, but fear my purple will be too sad for that melancholy room.

1666-08-22 12:50   Mrs. Knipp tells me my song, of “Beauty Retire” is mightily cried up, which I am not a little proud of; and do think I have done “It is Decreed” better, but I have not finished it.

1666-08-22 08:30   I perceive Sir W. Pen do look after Sir J. Minnes’s place if he dies, and though I love him not nor do desire to have him in, yet I do think he is the first man in England for it.

1666-08-21 21:51 r They did hire a fellow to thunder (which he had the art of doing upon a deale board) and to rain and hail, that is, make the noise of, so as did give them a pretence of undervaluing their merchants’ wines, by saying this thunder would spoil and turn them.

1666-08-21 21:49   Mr. Batelier and his sister Mary, and we sat chatting a great while, and he told me of his own knowledge, being with some others at Bourdeaux, making a bargain with another man at a taverne for some clarets.

1666-08-21 15:38   I passed down into the Hall, and there hear that Mr. Bowles, the grocer, after four or five days’ sickness, is dead, and this day buried.

1666-08-21 13:24   Dined at home, and sister Balty with us. My wife snappish because I denied her money to lay out this afternoon; however, good friends again.

1666-08-20 21:35   I find myself most happy in the keeping of all my accounts, for that after all the changings and turnings necessary in such an account, I find myself right to a farthing in an account of 127,000l.

1666-08-20 11:42   To Westminster to the Exchequer about my quarter tallies, and so to Lumbard Streete to choose stuff to hang my new intended closet, and have chosen purple.

1666-08-20 09:20   To Deptford by water, reading “Othello, Moore of Venice,” which I ever heretofore esteemed a mighty good play, but having so lately read “The Adventures of Five Houre,” it seems a mean thing.

1666-08-20 06:03   Waked with a violent knocking at Sir J. Minnes’s door, to call up Mrs. Hammon, crying out that Sir J. Minnes is a-dying. Which troubles me mightily, for he is a very good, harmless, honest gentleman, though not fit for the business.

1666-08-19 22:34 r It vexed me to understand no more from Reeves and his glasses touching the nature of the several refractions of the several figured glasses, he understanding the acting part, but not one bit the theory, nor can make any body understand it, which is a strange dullness, methinks.

1666-08-19 21:56 r Spong and I had several fine discourses upon the globes, particularly why the fixed stars do not rise and set at the same hour all the year long, which he could not demonstrate, nor I neither, the reason of.

1666-08-19 21:28 r Mr. Reeves did also bring a lantern with pictures in glass, to make strange things appear on a wall, very pretty. We did also at night see Jupiter and his girdle and satellites, very fine, with my twelve-foote glass, but could not Saturne, he being very dark.

1666-08-19 21:04   Comes Mr. Reeves and Mr. Spong, and all day with them, both before and after dinner, upon opticke enquiries, he bringing me a frame he closes on, to see how the rays of light do cut one another, and in a dark room with smoake, which is very pretty.

1666-08-18 11:45   Home, calling at my little mercer’s in Lumbard Street, who hath the pretty wench, like the old Queene, and there cheapened some stuffs to hang my room, that I intend to turn into a closet.

1666-08-17 22:09   Sir John Minnes come home tonight not well, from Chatham, where he hath been at a pay, holding it at Upnor Castle, because of the plague so much in the towne of Chatham. He hath, they say, got an ague, being so much on the water.

1666-08-17 16:54   The narrative of the late expedition in burning the ships is in print, and makes it a great thing, and I hope it is so.

1666-08-17 10:24   Home to my house by water, and there I find one of my new presses for my books brought home, which pleases me mightily. As, also, do my wife’s progresse upon her head that she is making.

1666-08-17 09:16 r Captain Erwin tells me the punishment frequently there for malefactors is cutting off the crowne of their head, which they do very dexterously, leaving their brains bare, which kills them presently.

1666-08-17 09:12   Back with Captain Erwin, discoursing about the East Indys, where he hath often been. He tells me how the King of Syam seldom goes out without thirty or forty thousand people with him, and not a word spoke, nor a hum or cough in the whole company to be heard.

1666-08-17 08:30   I had a piece of bride-cake sent me by Mrs. Barbary, she being here with her husband, and mighty nobly married, they say, she was, very fine, and he very rich, a strange fortune for so odd a looked maid, though her hands and body be good, and nature very good.

1666-08-17 07:10   Up and betimes with Captain Erwin down by water to Woolwich, I walking alone from Greenwich thither, making an end of the “Adventures of Five Hours,” which when all is done is the best play that ever I read in my life.

1666-08-16 16:34   Sir G. Carteret did tell us that upon the news of the burning of the ships and town the common people of Amsterdam did besiege De Witt’s house, and he was force to flee to the Prince of Orange, who is gone to Cleve to the marriage of his sister.

1666-08-16 13:40   Home, and there dined with me my Lady Pen only and W. Hewer at a haunch of venison boiled, where pretty merry, only my wife vexed me a little about demanding money to go with my Lady Pen to the Exchange to lay out.

1666-08-15 22:22   The guns of the Tower going off, and there being bonefires also in the street for this late good successe.

1666-08-15 09:20 r The Duke of York showed us the very place and manner, and that it was not our design or expectation to have done this, but only to have landed on the Fly, and burned some of their store; but being come in, we spied those ships, and with our long boats, one by one, fired them.

1666-08-15 08:03   I was called up by a letter from Sir W. Coventry, which, among other things, tells me how we have burned one hundred and sixty ships of the enemy within the Fly.

1666-08-15 03:32 r To my house; and there I made them drink, and then fell into dancing, and dressing, I and one Mr. Banister like women; and Mercer put on a suit of Tom’s, like a boy, and mighty mirth we had, and Mercer danced a jigg; and Nan Wright and my wife and Pegg Pen put on perriwigs.

1666-08-15 01:15 r And at last our businesses being most spent, we into Mrs. Mercer’s, and there mighty merry, smutting one another with candle grease and soot, till most of us were like devils.

1666-08-14 23:54 r To Mrs. Mercer’s gate, where the fire and boys expected us, and her son had provided abundance of serpents and rockets; and there mighty merr, flinging our fireworks, and burning one another and the people over the way.

1666-08-14 20:52   We had invited to a venison pasty Mr. Batelier and his sister Mary, Mrs. Mercer, her daughter Anne, Mr. Le Brun, and W. Hewer; and so we supped, and very merry.

1666-08-14 16:59 r We had a great many hectors in the same box with us (and one very fine went into the pit, and played his dog for a wager, which was a strange sport for a gentleman), where they drank wine, and drank Mercer’s health first, which I pledged with my hat off.

1666-08-14 16:32   With my wife and Mercer to the Beare-garden, where I have not been, I think, of many years, and saw some good sport of the bull’s tossing of the dogs: one into the very boxes. But it is a very rude and nasty pleasure.

1666-08-14 09:40   I abroad down to the Old Swan, and there I called and kissed Betty Michell, and would have got her to go with me to Westminster, but I find her a little colder than she used to be, methought, which did a little molest me.

1666-08-14 08:20   Comes Mr. Foley and his man, with a box of a great variety of carpenter’s and joyner’s tooles, which I had bespoke, to me, which please me mightily; but I will have more.

1666-08-13 16:32   I abroad to Stokes, and there did receive 1000l. worth in gold, paying 18½d. and 19d. for others exchange. Home with them, and there to my office to business.

1666-08-13 10:10   I thought it dangerous to be free with Sir W. Warren, for I do not think he can keep counsel, because he blabs to me what hath passed between other people and him.

1666-08-13 08:10   I to Paul’s Church-yard, to treat with a bookbinder, to come and gild the backs of all my books, to make them handsome, to stand in my new presses, when they come.

1666-08-12 21:04   I and my wife up to her closet to consider how to order that the next summer, if we live to it; and then down to my chamber to examine her kitchen accounts, and there I took occasion to fall out with her for her buying a laced handkercher and pinner without my leave.

1666-08-12 16:42   In comes Betty Michell and her husband, and so to dinner, I mightily pleased with their company. We passed the whole day talking with them, but without any pleasure, but only her being there.

1666-08-12 11:30   My thoughts very much upon the manner of my removal of my closet things the next week into my present musique room, if I find I can spare or get money to furnish it.

1666-08-11 16:20   I hear as if we had landed some men upon the Dutch coasts, but I believe it is but a foolery either in the report or the attempt.

1666-08-10 20:33   I am pleased to hear of Mrs. Barbara Sheldon’s good fortune, who is like to have Mr. Wood’s son, the mast-maker, a very rich man, and to be married speedily, she being already mighty fine upon it.

1666-08-10 13:43   Home to dinner, where sister Balty dined with us, and met a letter come to me from him. He is well at Harwich, going to the fleet.

1666-08-09 20:18 r I met also with Mr. Evelyn in the street, who tells me the sad condition at this very day at Deptford for the plague, and more at Deale (within his precinct as one of the Commissioners for sick and wounded seamen), that the towne is almost quite depopulated.

1666-08-09 19:50   I inquired, and find Mrs. Rawlinson is dead of the sickness, and her maid continues mighty ill. He himself is got out of the house.

1666-08-09 19:32   To Lumbard-streete about money, to enable me to pay Sir G. Carteret’s 3000l, which he hath lodged in my hands, in behalf of his son and my Lady Jemimah, toward their portion, which, I thank God, I am able to do at a minute’s warning.

1666-08-09 01:12   Home, and I find Reeves there, it being a mighty fine bright night, and so upon my leads, looking on the moon and Jupiter, with this twelve-foot glass and another of six foot, that he hath brought with him to-night, and the sights mighty pleasant.

1666-08-08 09:50   I attended with the rest of my fellows on the Duke, whom I found with two or three patches upon his nose and about his right eye, which come from his being struck with the bough of a tree the other day in his hunting; and it is a wonder it did not strike out his eye.

1666-08-08 09:04   Mr. Hooke did make me understand the nature of musicall sounds made by strings; and told me that having come to a certain number of vibrations to make any tone, he is able to tell how many strokes a fly makes with her wings by the note that it answers to in musique.

1666-08-07 22:04   Reeves and I up to the top of the house, and there we endeavoured to see the moon, and Saturne and Jupiter; but the heavens proved cloudy, and so we lost our labour, having taken pains to get things together, in order to the managing of our long glass.

1666-08-06 21:30 r I find my wife mightily out of order, and reproaching of Mrs. Pierce and Knipp as wenches, and I know not what. But I did give her no words to offend her, and quietly let all pass, and so to bed without any good look or words to or from my wife.

1666-08-06 19:04 r Here we talked of the ill-humour of my wife, which I did excuse as much as I could, and they seemed to admit of it, but did both confess they wondered at it.

1666-08-06 18:20 r I would not be removed from my civility to them, but sent for a coach, and went with them; Knipp saying that she come out of doors without a dinner to us, I took them to Old Fish Street, and there I did give them a jole of salmon, and what else was to be had.

1666-08-06 17:02 r Comes Mr. Pierce and his wife, the first time she also hath been here since her lying-in, having been brought to bed of boys, and both of them dead. And here we talked, and were pleasant, only my wife in a chagrin humour, she not being pleased with my kindness to either of them.

1666-08-06 15:40   In comes Mrs. Knipp, and I sat and talked with her, it being the first time of her being here since her being brought to bed. I very pleasant with her; but perceive my wife hath no great pleasure in her being here, she not being pleased with my kindness to her.

1666-08-06 10:32   I do hear that Greenwich is much worse than ever it was, and Deptford too: and Mrs. Sarah Daniel told us that they believed all the town would leave the town and come to London; which is now the receptacle of all the people from all infected places. God preserve us!

1666-08-05 21:04   My wife and I spent an hour in the garden, talking of our living in the country, when I shall be turned out of the office, as I fear the Parliament may find faults enough with the office to remove us all, and I am joyed to think in how good a condition I am to retire thither.

1666-08-05 19:23   We landed and walked at Barne-elmes, and then at the Neat Houses I landed and bought a millon, and we did also land and eat and drink at Wandsworth.

1666-08-05 16:56   With my wife, and Mercer, and Jane by water, all the afternoon up as high as Morclacke with great pleasure, and a fine day, reading over the second part of the “Siege of Rhodes,” with great delight.

1666-08-05 08:50   Down to the Old Swan, and there called Betty Michell and her husband, and had two or three a long salutes from her out of sight of su marido, which pleased me mightily.

1666-08-04 20:32   Sir W. Pen walked with me, and told me that he had certain notice that at Flushing they are in great distraction. De Ruyter dares not come on shore for fear of the people; nor any body open their houses or shops for fear of the tumult: which is a very good hearing.

1666-08-03 21:50   The death of Everson, and the report of our success, beyond expectation, in the killing of so great a number of men, hath raised the estimation of the late victory considerably; but it is only among fools: for all that was but accidental.

1666-08-03 20:02   I calling my wife at her sister’s, from whose husband we do now hear that he was safe this week, and going in a ship to the fleet from the buoy of the Nore, where he has been all this while, the fleet being gone before he got down.

1666-08-03 00:32 r I staid, in some pain, it being late, and post night. So supped and merrily home, but it was twelve at night first. However, sent away some letters, and home to bed.

1666-08-02 21:38   Down to Woolwich, reading and making an end of the “Rival Ladys,” and find it a very pretty play. At Woolwich, it being now night, I find my wife and Mercer, and Mr. Batelier and Mary there, and a supper getting ready.

1666-08-02 13:50   Lovett dined with me and Balty’s wife, who is in great pain for her husband, not hearing of him since the fight; but I understand he was not in it, going hence too late, and I am glad of it.

1666-08-01 22:06   Much pleased with my wife’s drawing today in her pictures, and so to supper and to bed very pleasant.

1666-08-01 18:20 r By and by I made her as merry as is possible, and towzed and tumbled her as I pleased. Mightily pleased with this afternoon’s mirth, but in great pain to ride in a coach with them, for fear of being seen.

1666-08-01 17:08 r Lord! to see the dissembling of this widow, how upon the singing of a certain jigg by Doll, Mrs. Martin’s sister, she seemed to be sick and fainted and God knows what, because the jigg, which her husband (who died this last sickness) loved.

1666-08-01 15:50   After dinner to Mrs. Martin’s, and there find Mrs. Burroughs, and by and by comes a pretty widow, one Mrs. Eastwood, and one Mrs. Fenton, a maid; and here merry kissing and looking on their breasts, and all the innocent pleasure in the world.

1666-08-01 11:32   Sir W. Coventry is not thoroughly pleased with the late management of the fight, nor with any thing that the Generalls do; only is glad to hear that De Ruyter is out of favour, and that this fight hath cost them 5,000 men.

1666-08-01 06:45   Up betimes to the settling of my last month’s accounts, and I bless God I find them very clear, and that I am worth 5700l, the most that ever my book did yet make out.
