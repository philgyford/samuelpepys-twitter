1666-06-11 22:10   Sir J. Bankes tells me that coming up from Rochester he overtook three or four hundred seamen, and he believes every day they come flocking from the fleet; which is a sad neglect, when it will be impossible to get others, and we have little reason to think that these will return.

1666-06-11 15:22 r Harman did plainly tell me that at the Council of War before the fight, it was against his reason to begin the fight then, and the reasons of most sober men there, the wind being such, and we to windward, that they could not use their lower tier of guns.

1666-06-11 15:14   I, with my Lady Pen and her daughter, to see Harman; whom we find lame in bed. His bones of his anckle are broke, but he hopes to do well soon; and a fine person by his discourse he seems to be and mighty hearty.

1666-06-11 12:03   At the office all the morning with Sir W. Coventry and some others of our board hiring of fireships, and Sir W. Coventry begins to see my pains again, which I do begin to take, and I am proud of it, and I hope shall continue it.

1666-06-11 08:22   By water to Sir W. Warren’s (the first time I was in his new house on the other side the water since he enlarged it) to discourse about our lighters that he hath bought for me, and I hope to get 100l. by this jobb.

1666-06-10 19:04   Sir G. Carteret do call the fleet’s retreat a very honourable retreat, and that the Duke of Albemarle did do well in it, and would have been well if he had done it sooner, rather than venture the loss of the fleet and crown, as he must have done if the Prince had not come.

1666-06-10 17:35   Putting all together, we are and are like to be in a sad condition. We are endeavouring to raise money by borrowing it of the City; but I do not think the City will lend a farthing.

1666-06-10 16:17 r He tells me further, how the Duke of York is wholly given up to his new mistress, my Lady Denham, going at noon-day with all his gentlemen to visit her in Scotland Yard; she declaring she will not be his mistress, to go up and down the Privy-stairs, but will be owned publicly.

1666-06-10 16:13 r He says, however, that the Duke of Albemarle is as high almost as ever, and pleases himself to think that he hath given the Dutch their bellies full, without sense of what he hath lost us; and talks how he knows now the way to beat them.

1666-06-10 16:09 r He says all the fleet confess their being chased home by the Dutch; and yet the body of the Dutch that did it, was not above forty sail at most.

1666-06-10 16:05 r He says that Holmes, Spragg, and Smith do all the business, and the old and wiser commanders nothing. So as Sir Thomas Teddiman (whom the King and all the world speak well of) is mightily discontented, as being wholly slighted.

1666-06-10 16:02   Pierce the surgeon tells me that all the commanders, officers, and even the common seamen do condemn every part of the conduct of the Duke of Albemarle: both in his fighting at all, in his manner of fighting, running among them in his retreat, and running the ships on ground.

1666-06-10 13:22 r Lord! how sick was I of W. Joyce’s company, both the impertinencies of it and his ill manners before me at my table to his wife, which I could hardly forbear taking notice of; I will prevent his giving me the like occasion again at my house I will warrant him.

1666-06-10 12:36   Home to dinner, where my cozen Joyces, both of them, they and their wives and little Will, come by invitation to dinner to me, and I had a good dinner for them.

1666-06-09 20:04   I am to observe how the drinking of some strong water did immediately put my eyes into a fit of sorenesse again as they were the other day. I mean my right eye only.

1666-06-09 18:32   I find my pretty Betty Michell and her husband at their door in Thames Streete, which I was glad to find, and went into their shop, and they made me drink some of their strong water, the first time I was ever with them there. I do exceedingly love her.

1666-06-09 16:55   Sir W. Coventry tells me more news of our suffering, by the death of one or two captains more than I knew before. But he do give over the thoughts of the safety of The Swiftsure or Essex.

1666-06-09 14:20   To Westminster Hall, and bought a pair of gloves, and to see how people do take this late fight at sea, and I find all give over the thoughts of it as a victory and to reckon it a great overthrow.

1666-06-09 08:15   To St. James’s, there to wait on the Duke of York, and had discourse with him about several businesses of the fleet. But, Lord! to see how the Court is divided about The Swiftsure and The Essex’s being safe. And wagers and odds laid on both sides.

1666-06-08 19:22   We hear the Swiftsure, Sir W. Barkeley, is come in safe to the Nore, after her being absent since the beginning of the fight, wherein she did not appear from beginning to end. But wherever she has been, they say she is arrived there well, which I pray God however may be true.

1666-06-08 17:45   Creed and I down the river as low as Sir W. Warren’s, with whom I did motion a business that may be of profit to me, about buying some lighters to send down to the fleet, wherein he will assist me.

1666-06-08 16:28   Out to White Hall to a Committee for Tangier, but it met not. But, Lord! to see how melancholy the Court is, under the thoughts of this last overthrow (for so it is), instead of a victory, so much and so unreasonably expected.

1666-06-08 13:52   Balty and I to my office, and there talked a great deal of this fight; and I am mightily pleased in him and have great content in, and hopes of his doing well.

1666-06-08 11:50 r Mings is shot through the face, and into the shoulder, where the bullet is lodged. Young Holmes is also ill wounded, and Atber in The Rupert.

1666-06-08 11:44 r The Duke did do most right to Sir Thomas Teddiman, of whom a scandal was raised, but without cause, he having behaved himself most brave all the whole fight, and to extraordinary great purpose, having given Trump himself such a broadside as was hardly ever given to any ship.

1666-06-08 11:10   Home, where to my very great joy I find Balty come home without any hurt, after the utmost imaginable danger he hath gone through in the Henery, being upon the quarterdeck with Harman all the time.

1666-06-08 06:25   Up very betimes and to attend the Duke of York by order, all of us to report to him what the works are that are required of us and to divide among us, wherein I have taken a very good share, and more than I can perform, I doubt.

1666-06-07 20:24 r The Duke of Albemarle writes that he never fought with worse officers in his life, not above twenty of them behaving themselves like men. Sir William Clerke lost his leg; and in two days died.

1666-06-07 20:20   I do find great reason to think that we are beaten in every respect, and that we are the losers. The Essex carried into Holland; the Swiftsure missing (Sir William Barkeley) ever since the beginning of the fight. Captains Bacon, Tearne, Wood, Mootham, Whitty, and Coppin, slayne.

1666-06-07 17:55   Mr. Wayth tells me plainly from Captain Page’s own mouth (who hath lost his arm in the fight), that the Dutch did pursue us two hours before they left us, and then they suffered us to go on homewards, and they retreated towards their coast: which is very sad news.

1666-06-07 16:50   I left alone with little Mrs. Tooker, whom I kept with me in my chamber all the afternoon, and did what I would with her.

1666-06-07 12:44   Home to dinner all alone, my father and people being gone all to Woolwich to see the launching of the new ship The Greenwich, built by Chr. Pett.

1666-06-07 08:01 r But, above all, that The Prince run on shore upon the Galloper, and there stuck; was endeavoured to be fetched off by the Dutch, but could not; and so they burned her; and Sir G. Ascue is taken prisoner, and carried into Holland.

1666-06-07 07:55   My Lord Bruncker and Sir T. H., tell me quite contrary news, which astonishes me: that is to say, that we are beaten, lost many ships and good commanders; have not taken one ship of the enemy’s; nor is it certain that we were left masters of the field.

1666-06-06 23:57   Sir Daniel Harvy, who was in the whole fight with the Generall, tells me that there appear but thirty-six in all of the Dutch fleet left at the end of the voyage when they run home. The joy of the City was this night exceeding great.

1666-06-06 23:50 r Idled away the whole night at the bonefire in the streets. Some of the people thereabouts going about with musquets, and did give me two or three vollies of their musquets, I giving them a crown to drink.

1666-06-06 21:20 r To the gate, with the women all about me, and Mrs. Mercer’s son had provided a great many serpents, and so I made the women all fire some serpents.

1666-06-06 20:32   Before I got home, the bonefires were lighted all the towne over, and I going through Crouched Friars, seeing Mercer at her mother’s gate, stopped, and ’light.

1666-06-06 17:55   I to Lovett’s, and there to my trouble saw plainly that my project of varnished books will not take, it not keeping colour, not being able to take polishing upon a single paper. 

1666-06-06 16:10   Drawing up my vows for the rest of the year to Christmas; but, Lord! to see in what a condition of happiness I am, if I would but keep myself so; but my love of pleasure is such, that my very soul is angry with itself for my vanity in so doing.

1666-06-06 13:35   Home and found my wife at dinner, and after dinner my father and she out to Hales’s, where my father is to begin to sit to-day for his picture, which I have a desire to have.

1666-06-06 12:25   Comes to our office 40 people almost of all sorts and qualities to hear the news, which I took great delight to tell them. 

1666-06-06 09:50 r We were all so overtaken with this good news, that the Duke ran with it to the King, who was gone to chappell, and there all the Court was in a hubbub, being rejoiced over head and ears in this good news.

1666-06-06 09:25   It is conceived reasonably, that of all the Dutch fleet, which, with what recruits they had, come to one hundred sail, there is not above fifty got home; and of them, few if any of their flags.

1666-06-06 09:10   Into the Parke, walking through to White Hall, and there every body listening for guns, but none heard, and every creature is now overjoyed and concludes upon very good grounds that the Dutch are beaten because we have heard no guns nor no news of our fleet.

1666-06-06 07:35   To St. James’s, where we all met, and did our business as usual with the Duke, and among other things had Captain Cocke’s proposal of Lord Bruncker, which I make use of as a monkey do the cat’s foot.

1666-06-05 23:22   Home, and so eat a bit and to bed, having received no manner of news this day, but of The Rainbow’s being put in from the fleet, maimed as the other ships are, and some say that Sir W. Clerke is dead of his leg being cut off.

1666-06-05 17:15   By water down to Deptford, and thence down to Longreach, calling on all the ships in the way, seeing their condition for sayling, and what they want.

1666-06-05 12:05   To the office, where all the morning, expecting every hour more news of the fleet and the issue of yesterday’s fight, but nothing come.

1666-06-04 21:30   Creed and I walked into the Park, it being fine moonshine, discoursing of the unhappinesse of our fleet, what it would have been if the Prince had not come in, how much the Duke hath failed of what he was so presumptuous of.

1666-06-04 18:38   With Mr. Hooke to my house and there lent some of my tables of naval matters, the names of rigging and the timbers about a ship, in order to Dr. Wilkins’ book coming out about the Universal Language.

1666-06-04 16:02   Home to dinner, and was followed by several people to be told the news, and good news it is. God send we may hear a good issue of this day’s business!

1666-06-04 14:10 r The King did pull out of his pocket about twenty pieces in gold, and did give it Daniel for himself and his companion; and so parted, mightily pleased with the account he did give him of the fight, and the success it ended with.

1666-06-04 14:05 r No particular person spoken of to be hurt but Sir W. Clerke, who hath lost his leg, and bore it bravely. The Duke himself had a little hurt in his thigh, but signified little.

1666-06-04 14:00 r But the Prince come up with the Generall’s fleet, and the Dutch come together again and bore towards their own coast, and we with them; and now what the consequence of this day will be, at that time fighting, we know not.

1666-06-04 13:55 r The Duke himself, then those people were put into the catch, and by and by spied the Prince’s fleet coming, upon which De Ruyter called a little council (being in chase at this time of us), and thereupon their fleet divided into two squadrons.

1666-06-04 13:50 r The fight continued till night, and then again the next morning from five till seven at night. And so, too, yesterday morning they begun again, and continued till about four o’clock, they chasing us for the most part, we flying from them.

1666-06-04 13:45 r We found the Dutch fleet at anchor half seas over, between Dunkirke and Ostend, and made them let slip their anchors. They about ninety, and we less than sixty.

1666-06-04 13:40 r I went and fetched the seamen into the Vane room to the King, and there he heard the whole account.

1666-06-04 13:03   News is brought me of a couple of men come to speak with me from the fleet; who should it be but Mr Daniel, all muffled up, and his face as black as the chimney, and covered with dirt, pitch, and tar, and powder, and muffled with dirty clouts, and his right eye stopped with okum.

1666-06-04 10:50   Major Halsey did bring news that he did see the Prince and his fleet at nine of the clock yesterday morning, four or five leagues to sea behind the Goodwin, so that by the hearing of the guns this morning we conclude he is come to the fleet.

1666-06-04 09:16   So far as to yesterday it is a miraculous thing that we did hear every where most plainly the guns go off, and yet at Deale and Dover to last night they did not hear one word of a fight, nor think they heard one gun. 

1666-06-04 09:12 r I saw a letter, dated last night, from Strowd, Governor of Dover Castle, which says that the Prince come thither the night before with his fleet, but that for the guns which we writ that we heard, it is only a mistake for thunder.

1666-06-04 08:45   Walking through the Park we saw hundreds of people listening at the Gravel-pits, and to and again in the Park to hear the guns.

1666-06-03 19:15   Home by the ’Change, which is full of people still, and all talk highly of the failure of the Prince in not making more haste after his instructions did come, and of our managements here in not giving it sooner and with more care and oftener thence.

1666-06-03 18:30   Meeting Creed, he and I by coach to Hide Parke alone to talke of these things, and do bless God that my Lord Sandwich was not here at this time to be concerned in a business like to be so misfortunate.

1666-06-03 17:18 r Have lost above 100 men, and a good many women (God knows what is become of Balty), and at last quenched his own fire and got to Aldbrough; being, as all say, the greatest hazard that ever any ship escaped, and as bravely managed by him.

1666-06-03 17:15   A letter from Harman in the Henery; that being fallen into the body of the Dutch fleet, he made his way through them, was set on by three fire-ships, got two of them off, and disabled the third; was set on fire himself; upon which many of his men leapt into the sea and perished.

1666-06-03 16:48 r It is also reported by some Victuallers that the Duke of Albemarle and Holmes their flags were shot down, and both fain to come to anchor to renew their rigging and sails.

1666-06-03 16:36   Met with this bad news farther, that the Prince come to Dover but at ten o’clock last night, and there heard nothing of a fight; so that we are defeated of all our hopes of his helpe to the fleet.

1666-06-03 15:20   To Mrs. Martin, and there did what je voudrais avec her, both devante and backward, which is also muy bon plazer. So by and by he come in, and after some discourse with him I away to White Hall.

1666-06-03 14:45   After dinner my father, wife, sister, and Mercer by water to Woolwich, while I walked by land, and saw the Exchange as full of people, and hath been all this noon as of any other day, only for news.

1666-06-03 09:10   The only news from the fleet is brought by Captain Elliott, of The Portland, which, by being run on board by The Guernsey, was disabled from staying abroad; so is come in to Aldbrough. That he saw one of the Dutch great ships blown up, and three on fire.

1666-06-02 19:10   Down to Blackewall, and there saw the soldiers (who were by this time gotten most of them drunk) shipped off. Lord! to see how the poor fellows kissed their wives and sweethearts in that simple manner at their going off, and shouted, and let off their guns, was strange sport.

1666-06-02 18:20   A return is come from Prince Rupert, that he did intend to sail from St. Ellen’s point; which gives us great hopes, the wind being very fair, that he is with them this even, and the fresh going off of the guns makes us believe the same.

1666-06-02 16:04   I went on shore with Captain Erwin at Greenwich, and into the Parke, and there we could hear the guns from the fleete most plainly. Thence he and I to the King’s Head and there bespoke a dish of steaks for our dinner.

1666-06-02 13:32   Down to Greenwich, and there appointed two yachts to be ready; and did order the soldiers to march to Blackewall.

1666-06-02 11:45   Presently come orders for our sending away to the fleet a recruite of 200 soldiers. So I rose from the table, and to the Victualling office, and thence upon the River among several vessels, to consider of the sending them away.

1666-06-02 09:08 r They are, ere this, certainly engaged; besides, several do averr they heard the guns all yesterday in the afternoon. This put us at the Board into a tosse.

1666-06-02 09:05   Certain news is brought us of a letter come to the King from the Duke of Albemarle, dated yesterday at eleven o’clock, as they were sailing to the Gunfleet, that they were in sight of the Dutch fleete, and were fitting themselves to fight them.

1666-06-01 14:25   My uncle and Woolly and I out into their yard, to talk about what may be done hereafter to all our profits by prizegoods, which did give us reason to lament the losse of the opportunity of the last year.

1666-06-01 13:34 r Here dined the fair Mrs. Margaret Wight, who is a very fine lady, but the cast of her eye, got only by an ill habit, do her much wrong and her hands are bad; but she hath the face of a noble Roman lady.

1666-06-01 13:29   I and my father, wife and sister, dined at Aunt Wight’s here hard by at Mr. Woolly’s, upon sudden warning, they being to go out of town to-morrow.
