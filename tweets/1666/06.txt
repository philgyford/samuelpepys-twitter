1666-06-30 22:28   I am providing against a foul day to get as much money into my hands as I can, at least out of the public hands, that so, if a turn, which I fear, do come, I may have a little to trust to.

1666-06-30 21:50   Our new ugly maid, Luce, had like to have broke her necke in the dark, going down our upper stairs; but, which I was glad of, the poor girl did only bruise her head, but at first did lie on the ground groaning and drawing her breath, like one a-dying.

1666-06-30 16:48   It is now become impossible to have so much as a letter carried: nay, out of Victualling ships full loaden to go down to the fleet, and out of the vessels of the officers of the Ordnance, they press men, so that for want of discipline in this respect I do fear all will be undone.

1666-06-30 11:05 r My Lord Mayor had not money to pay the pressed-money to the men; nor to take up boats to carry them down through bridge to the ships I had prepared to carry them down in; I did there out of my owne purse disburse 15l. to pay for their pressing and diet.

1666-06-30 10:10   To my Lord Mayor about getting shipped some men that they have pressed in the City, the persons wholly unfit for sea, and many of them people of very good fashion, which is a shame to think of, and carried to Bridewell they are, yet without being impressed with money legally.

1666-06-29 17:24 r And that the country is bringing in picke-axes, and shovells, and wheel-barrows into Callice; that there are 6,000 men armed with head, back, and breast (Frenchmen) ready to go on board the Dutch fleet, and will be followed by 12,000 more.

1666-06-29 17:20   To the office; where I met with a letter from Dover, which tells me (and it did come by express) that news is brought over by a gentleman from Callice that the Dutch fleet, 130 sail, are come upon the French coast.

1666-06-28 21:15 r The Dutch are now known to be out, and we may expect them every hour upon our coast. But our fleet is in pretty good readiness for them.

1666-06-28 21:13   All the afternoon and evening at the office, my mind full of getting my accounts over, and as much money in my hands as I can, for a great turn is to be feared in the times, the French having some great design in hand, and our necessities on every side very great.

1666-06-27 17:48   My Lord Bellasses is going down to his garrison to Hull, by the King’s command, to put it in order for fear of an invasion which course I perceive is taken upon the sea-coasts round; for we have a real apprehension of the King of France’s invading us.

1666-06-27 16:08   To Lovett’s, who has now done something towards the varnishing of single paper for the making of books, which will do, I think, very well.

1666-06-27 14:27   Carried my wife to her sister’s and I to Mr. Hales’s, to pay for my father’s picture, which cost me 10l. the head and 25s. the frame.

1666-06-27 11:15   To Mr. Cade’s, the stationer, stood till the shower was over, it being a great and welcome one after so much dry weather. Here I understand that Ogleby is putting out some new fables of his owne, which will be very fine and very satyricall. 

1666-06-27 10:21   To my office awhile, and then down the river a little way to see vessels ready for the carrying down of 400 land soldiers to the fleet.

1666-06-26 22:53   Into the garden, then my wife and Mercer and my Lady Pen and her daughter with us, and here we sung in the dark very finely half an hour, and so home to supper and to bed.

1666-06-26 22:20   Mary my cookemayde, that hath been with us about three months, but find herself not able to do my worke, so is gone with great kindness away, and another (Luce) come, very ugly and plain, but may be a good servant for all that.

1666-06-26 22:04   To the office again, where all the afternoon full of business, and there till night, that my eyes were sore, that I could not write no longer.

1666-06-26 12:12   Come Mr. Chichly to Sir W. Coventry, to tell him the ill successe of the guns made for the Loyall London; which is, that in the trial every one of the great guns, the whole cannon of seven (as I take it), broke in pieces, which is a strange mishap.

1666-06-26 11:57   Up and to my office betimes, and there all the morning, very busy to get out the fleete, the Dutch being now for certain out, and we shall not, we thinke, be much behindhand with them.

1666-06-25 22:10   So home and to bed, and this night the first night of my lying without a waistcoat, which I hope I shall very well endure.

1666-06-25 16:34 r I pulled off a little orange by stealth (the man being mighty curious of them) and eat it, and it was just as other little green small oranges are; as big as half the end of my little finger.

1666-06-25 16:22 r But the gardens are excellent; and here I first saw oranges grow: some green, some half, some a quarter, and some full ripe, on the same tree, and one fruit of the same tree do come a year or two after the other.

1666-06-25 16:06 r Mr. Drake’s one, where the garden is good, and house and the prospect admirable; the other my Lord Brooke’s, where the gardens are much better, but the house not so good, nor the prospect good at all.

1666-06-25 16:04   I did go out to Aldgate, there to be overtaken by Mrs. Margot Pen in her father’s coach, and my wife and Mercer with her, and Mrs. Pen carried us to two gardens at Hackny (which I every day grow more and more in love with).

1666-06-25 10:37   I did with great pleasure hear Mr. Caesar play some good things on his lute, while he come to teach my boy Tom, and I did give him 40s. for his encouragement.

1666-06-25 08:04   This being the first day of my putting on my black stuff bombazin suit, and I hope to feel no inconvenience by it, the weather being extremely hot.

1666-06-24 17:55   Sir W. Coventry concurs with me, that the next bout will be a fatal one to one side or other, because, if we be beaten, we shall not be able to set out our fleet again.

1666-06-24 15:27   Major Halsey says that the Duke of Albemarle do say that this is a victory we have had, having, as he was sure, killed them 8000 men, and sunk about fourteen of their ships; but nothing like this appears true.

1666-06-24 14:49   I hear that Sir Francis Prujean is dead. He died very rich, and had for the last year lived very handsomely, his lady bringing him to it. He was no great painstaker in person; and, as Dr. Clerke says, was of a great judgment, but hath writ nothing to leave his name to posterity.

1666-06-24 06:24   Up, but, being weary the last night, not so soon as I intended.

1666-06-23 22:14   To bed, fully resolved to rise betimes, and go down the river to-morrow morning, being vexed this night to find none of the officers in the yard at 7 at night, nor any body concerned as if it were a Dutch warr.

1666-06-23 22:10   Mercer’s mother in the evening did come and satisfy my wife, and by and by Mercer did come, which I was mighty glad of and eased of much pain about her.

1666-06-23 19:34   Down to Tower Wharfe thinking to go by water, but could not get watermen; they being now so scarce, by reason of the great press; so to the Custome House, and there, with great threats, got a couple to carry me down to Deptford, all the way reading Pompey the Great. 

1666-06-23 13:27   What with the going away of my father today and the loss of Mercer, I after dinner went up to my chamber and there could have cried to myself, had not people come to me about business.

1666-06-23 08:03   I to my papers, but vexed at what I heard but a little of this morning, before my wife went out, that Mercer and she fell out last night, and that the girl is gone home to her mother’s for all-together.

1666-06-23 05:32   My father and sister very betimes took their leave; and my wife, with all possible kindness, went with them to the coach, I being mightily pleased with their company thus long.

1666-06-22 23:10   My father, wife, and sister late abroad upon the water, and Mercer being gone to her mother’s and staid so long she could not get into the office, which vexed me.

1666-06-22 07:48   Mr. Peter Barr sent me a tierce of claret, which is very welcome.

1666-06-21 21:04   While at supper comes young Michell, whose wife I love, little Betty Howlet, to get my favour about a ticket, and I am glad of this occasion of obliging him and give occasion of his coming to me, for I must be better acquainted with him and her.

1666-06-21 16:34   Sir George Smith tells me that my Lord Chancellor and some of the Court have been with the City, and the City have voted to lend the King 100,000l.; which, if soon paid (as he says he believes it will), will be a greater service than I did ever expect at this time from the City.

1666-06-21 15:52   At Mr. Debasty’s I saw, in a gold frame, a picture of a Fluter playing on his flute which I took for paynting, but at last observed it a piece of tapestry, and is the finest that ever I saw in my life for figures, and good natural colours, and a very fine thing it is indeed.

1666-06-21 12:08   Home to dinner, my father, sister, and wife dining at Sarah Giles’s, poor woman, where I should have been, but my pride would not suffer me.

1666-06-20 16:32   To Hales’s to see my father’s picture, which is now near finished and is very good, and here I staid and took a nap of an hour, thinking my father and wife would have come, but they did not.

1666-06-20 13:55   To the Swan and sent for a bit of meat and dined there, and thence to Faythorne, the picture-seller’s, and there chose two or three good Cutts to try to varnish.

1666-06-20 06:52   Up, but in some pain of the collique. I have of late taken too much cold by washing my feet and going in a thin silk waistcoat, without any other coate over it, and open-breasted, but I hope it will go over.

1666-06-19 22:32   So home and to supper with beans and bacon and to bed.

1666-06-19 21:04   With my wife into the garden and there sang with Mercer, whom I feel myself begin to love too much by handling of her breasts in a morning when she dresses me, they being the finest that ever I saw in my life, that is the truth of it.

1666-06-19 15:45   I to Sir. G. Carteret’s by appointment; where I perceive by him the King is going to borrow some money of the City; but I fear it will do no good, but hurt.

1666-06-18 22:03   The great news is come of the French, their taking the island of St. Christopher’s from us; and it is to be feared they have done the like of all those islands thereabouts this makes the city mad.

1666-06-18 21:22   Sir W. Coventry is returned this night from the fleet, he being the activest man in the world, and we all (myself particularly) more afeard of him than of the King or his service, for aught I see; God forgive us!

1666-06-18 11:05   To Hales’s to see how my father’s picture goes on, which pleases me mighty well, though I find again, as I did in Mrs. Pierce’s, that a picture may have more of a likeness in the first or second working than it shall have when finished.

1666-06-17 17:50   Wanting a coach to carry us home I walked out as far as the New Exchange to find one, but could not. So down to the Milke-house, and drank three glasses of whey, and then up into the Strand again, and there met with a coach.

1666-06-17 16:44 r As to Pall my father tells me he is mightily satisfied with Ensum, and so I promised to give her 500l. presently, and to oblige myself to 100 more on the birth of her first child, he insuring her in 10l. per annum for every 100l.

1666-06-17 16:32   My father told me his estate produced about 80l. per annum, but then there goes 30l. per annum taxes and other things, certain charge, which I do promise to make good as far as this 30l, at which the poor man was overjoyed and wept.

1666-06-17 13:15   To Anthony Joyce’s, where William Joyce and his wife were, and had a good dinner; but, Lord! how sick was I of the company, only hope I shall have no more of it a good while.

1666-06-17 10:22   My wife and sister and Mercer and I walked out in the morning, it being fine weather, to Christ Church, and there heard a silly sermon, but sat where we saw one of the prettiest little boys with the prettiest mouth that ever I saw in life.

1666-06-16 17:28   It seems the Dutch do mightily insult of their victory, and they have great reason.1 Sir William Barkeley was killed before his ship taken; and there he lies dead in a sugar-chest, for every body to see, with his flag standing up by him.

1666-06-15 22:14   My eyes beginning to be sore with overmuch writing, I to supper and to bed.

1666-06-15 11:48   To the Exchequer, but could not persuade the blockheaded fellows to do what I desire, of breaking my great tallys into less, notwithstanding my Lord Treasurer’s order, which vexed so much that I would not bestow more time and trouble among a company of dunces.

1666-06-15 10:15   To the office come my pretty widow Mrs. Burrows, poor woman, to get her ticket paid for her husband’s service, which I did her myself, and did bezar her muchas vezes, and I do hope may thereafter have mas de su company.

1666-06-15 08:35   Mr. Bland, come to me, who presented me yesterday with a very fine African mat, to lay upon the ground under a bed of state, being the first fruits of our peace with Guyland.

1666-06-14 22:12   Took out my father, wife, sister, and Mercer our grand Tour, and made it ten at night before we got home, only drink at the door at Islington at the Katherine Wheel.

1666-06-13 22:33 r I parted thence, with a very good will, but very civil, and away to the waterside, and sent for a pint of sack and so home, drank what I would and gave the waterman the rest; and so adieu.

1666-06-13 22:05   I to Mrs. Bagwell’s house, and did what I would. But I was not a little fearful of what she told me, which is that her servant was dead of the plague, and that she had new whitened the house all below stairs, but that above stairs they are not so fit for me to go up to.

1666-06-13 16:46 r Sir W. Coventry was herewith much moved (as well as I, who could hardly abstain from weeping), and took their names, and so parted; telling me that he would move His Royal Highness as in a thing very extraordinary, which was done.

1666-06-13 16:44 r “…have done the last office of laying him in the ground. We would be glad we had any other to offer after him. All we have is our lives; if you will please to get His Royal Highness to give us a fireship, and do that that shall show our memory of our commander, and our revenge.”

1666-06-13 16:42 r About a dozen able, lusty, proper men come to the coach-side with tears in their eyes, and one of them that spoke for the rest begun and says to Sir W. Coventry, “We are here a dozen of us that have long known and loved and served our dead commander, Sir Christopher Mings, and…”

1666-06-13 16:40   I went with Sir W. Coventry into his coach, and being in it with him there happened this extraordinary case, one of the most romantique that ever I heard of in my life, and could not have believed, but that I did see it; which was this:

1666-06-13 16:22   To Sir Christopher Mings’s funeral, but find them gone to church. However I into the church and there heard the service, and staid till they buried him, and then out.

1666-06-13 14:34 r Whereupon Balty run out of doors to overtake the coach, but could not, so came back again, and mighty merry at dinner to thinke of my surprize.

1666-06-13 14:32   Balty and I to dinner, and in the middle of my grace, praying for a blessing upon these his good creatures, my mind fell upon my lobsters: upon which I cried, Odd zooks! and Balty looked upon me like a man at a losse what I meant. But then I cried, what is become of my lobsters?

1666-06-13 13:40   With mighty content homeward, and in my way at the Stockes did buy a couple of lobsters, and so home to dinner.

1666-06-13 13:15 r Here I find my father’s picture begun, and so much to my content that it joys my heart to think that I should have his picture so well done; who, besides that he is my father, and a man that loves me, is also, at this day, one of the most careful and innocent men in the world.

1666-06-13 12:50   With Balty to Hales’s by coach, it being the seventh day from my making my late oaths, and by them I am at liberty to dispense with any of my oaths every seventh day after I had for the six days before going performed all my vows.

1666-06-12 15:06 r  So that, only for a long petticoat dragging under their men’s coats, nobody could take them for women in any point whatever; which was an odde sight, and a sight did not please me.

1666-06-12 15:05   To White Hall. Walking here in the galleries I find the Ladies of Honour dressed in their riding garbs, with coats and doublets with deep skirts, just for all the world like mine, and buttoned their doublets up the breast, with perriwigs and with hats.

1666-06-11 22:10   Sir J. Bankes tells me that coming up from Rochester he overtook three or four hundred seamen, and he believes every day they come flocking from the fleet; which is a sad neglect, when it will be impossible to get others, and we have little reason to think that these will return.

1666-06-11 15:22 r Harman did plainly tell me that at the Council of War before the fight, it was against his reason to begin the fight then, and the reasons of most sober men there, the wind being such, and we to windward, that they could not use their lower tier of guns.

1666-06-11 15:14   I, with my Lady Pen and her daughter, to see Harman; whom we find lame in bed. His bones of his anckle are broke, but he hopes to do well soon; and a fine person by his discourse he seems to be and mighty hearty.

1666-06-11 12:03   At the office all the morning with Sir W. Coventry and some others of our board hiring of fireships, and Sir W. Coventry begins to see my pains again, which I do begin to take, and I am proud of it, and I hope shall continue it.

1666-06-11 08:22   By water to Sir W. Warren’s (the first time I was in his new house on the other side the water since he enlarged it) to discourse about our lighters that he hath bought for me, and I hope to get 100l. by this jobb.

1666-06-10 19:04   Sir G. Carteret do call the fleet’s retreat a very honourable retreat, and that the Duke of Albemarle did do well in it, and would have been well if he had done it sooner, rather than venture the loss of the fleet and crown, as he must have done if the Prince had not come.

1666-06-10 17:35   Putting all together, we are and are like to be in a sad condition. We are endeavouring to raise money by borrowing it of the City; but I do not think the City will lend a farthing.

1666-06-10 16:17 r He tells me further, how the Duke of York is wholly given up to his new mistress, my Lady Denham, going at noon-day with all his gentlemen to visit her in Scotland Yard; she declaring she will not be his mistress, to go up and down the Privy-stairs, but will be owned publicly.

1666-06-10 16:13 r He says, however, that the Duke of Albemarle is as high almost as ever, and pleases himself to think that he hath given the Dutch their bellies full, without sense of what he hath lost us; and talks how he knows now the way to beat them.

1666-06-10 16:09 r He says all the fleet confess their being chased home by the Dutch; and yet the body of the Dutch that did it, was not above forty sail at most.

1666-06-10 16:05 r He says that Holmes, Spragg, and Smith do all the business, and the old and wiser commanders nothing. So as Sir Thomas Teddiman (whom the King and all the world speak well of) is mightily discontented, as being wholly slighted.

1666-06-10 16:02   Pierce the surgeon tells me that all the commanders, officers, and even the common seamen do condemn every part of the conduct of the Duke of Albemarle: both in his fighting at all, in his manner of fighting, running among them in his retreat, and running the ships on ground.

1666-06-10 13:22 r Lord! how sick was I of W. Joyce’s company, both the impertinencies of it and his ill manners before me at my table to his wife, which I could hardly forbear taking notice of; I will prevent his giving me the like occasion again at my house I will warrant him.

1666-06-10 12:36   Home to dinner, where my cozen Joyces, both of them, they and their wives and little Will, come by invitation to dinner to me, and I had a good dinner for them.

1666-06-09 20:04   I am to observe how the drinking of some strong water did immediately put my eyes into a fit of sorenesse again as they were the other day. I mean my right eye only.

1666-06-09 18:32   I find my pretty Betty Michell and her husband at their door in Thames Streete, which I was glad to find, and went into their shop, and they made me drink some of their strong water, the first time I was ever with them there. I do exceedingly love her.

1666-06-09 16:55   Sir W. Coventry tells me more news of our suffering, by the death of one or two captains more than I knew before. But he do give over the thoughts of the safety of The Swiftsure or Essex.

1666-06-09 14:20   To Westminster Hall, and bought a pair of gloves, and to see how people do take this late fight at sea, and I find all give over the thoughts of it as a victory and to reckon it a great overthrow.

1666-06-09 08:15   To St. James’s, there to wait on the Duke of York, and had discourse with him about several businesses of the fleet. But, Lord! to see how the Court is divided about The Swiftsure and The Essex’s being safe. And wagers and odds laid on both sides.

1666-06-08 19:22   We hear the Swiftsure, Sir W. Barkeley, is come in safe to the Nore, after her being absent since the beginning of the fight, wherein she did not appear from beginning to end. But wherever she has been, they say she is arrived there well, which I pray God however may be true.

1666-06-08 17:45   Creed and I down the river as low as Sir W. Warren’s, with whom I did motion a business that may be of profit to me, about buying some lighters to send down to the fleet, wherein he will assist me.

1666-06-08 16:28   Out to White Hall to a Committee for Tangier, but it met not. But, Lord! to see how melancholy the Court is, under the thoughts of this last overthrow (for so it is), instead of a victory, so much and so unreasonably expected.

1666-06-08 13:52   Balty and I to my office, and there talked a great deal of this fight; and I am mightily pleased in him and have great content in, and hopes of his doing well.

1666-06-08 11:50 r Mings is shot through the face, and into the shoulder, where the bullet is lodged. Young Holmes is also ill wounded, and Atber in The Rupert.

1666-06-08 11:44 r The Duke did do most right to Sir Thomas Teddiman, of whom a scandal was raised, but without cause, he having behaved himself most brave all the whole fight, and to extraordinary great purpose, having given Trump himself such a broadside as was hardly ever given to any ship.

1666-06-08 11:10   Home, where to my very great joy I find Balty come home without any hurt, after the utmost imaginable danger he hath gone through in the Henery, being upon the quarterdeck with Harman all the time.

1666-06-08 06:25   Up very betimes and to attend the Duke of York by order, all of us to report to him what the works are that are required of us and to divide among us, wherein I have taken a very good share, and more than I can perform, I doubt.

1666-06-07 20:24 r The Duke of Albemarle writes that he never fought with worse officers in his life, not above twenty of them behaving themselves like men. Sir William Clerke lost his leg; and in two days died.

1666-06-07 20:20   I do find great reason to think that we are beaten in every respect, and that we are the losers. The Essex carried into Holland; the Swiftsure missing (Sir William Barkeley) ever since the beginning of the fight. Captains Bacon, Tearne, Wood, Mootham, Whitty, and Coppin, slayne.

1666-06-07 17:55   Mr. Wayth tells me plainly from Captain Page’s own mouth (who hath lost his arm in the fight), that the Dutch did pursue us two hours before they left us, and then they suffered us to go on homewards, and they retreated towards their coast: which is very sad news.

1666-06-07 16:50   I left alone with little Mrs. Tooker, whom I kept with me in my chamber all the afternoon, and did what I would with her.

1666-06-07 12:44   Home to dinner all alone, my father and people being gone all to Woolwich to see the launching of the new ship The Greenwich, built by Chr. Pett.

1666-06-07 08:01 r But, above all, that The Prince run on shore upon the Galloper, and there stuck; was endeavoured to be fetched off by the Dutch, but could not; and so they burned her; and Sir G. Ascue is taken prisoner, and carried into Holland.

1666-06-07 07:55   My Lord Bruncker and Sir T. H., tell me quite contrary news, which astonishes me: that is to say, that we are beaten, lost many ships and good commanders; have not taken one ship of the enemy’s; nor is it certain that we were left masters of the field.

1666-06-06 23:57   Sir Daniel Harvy, who was in the whole fight with the Generall, tells me that there appear but thirty-six in all of the Dutch fleet left at the end of the voyage when they run home. The joy of the City was this night exceeding great.

1666-06-06 23:50 r Idled away the whole night at the bonefire in the streets. Some of the people thereabouts going about with musquets, and did give me two or three vollies of their musquets, I giving them a crown to drink.

1666-06-06 21:20 r To the gate, with the women all about me, and Mrs. Mercer’s son had provided a great many serpents, and so I made the women all fire some serpents.

1666-06-06 20:32   Before I got home, the bonefires were lighted all the towne over, and I going through Crouched Friars, seeing Mercer at her mother’s gate, stopped, and ’light.

1666-06-06 17:55   I to Lovett’s, and there to my trouble saw plainly that my project of varnished books will not take, it not keeping colour, not being able to take polishing upon a single paper. 

1666-06-06 16:10   Drawing up my vows for the rest of the year to Christmas; but, Lord! to see in what a condition of happiness I am, if I would but keep myself so; but my love of pleasure is such, that my very soul is angry with itself for my vanity in so doing.

1666-06-06 13:35   Home and found my wife at dinner, and after dinner my father and she out to Hales’s, where my father is to begin to sit to-day for his picture, which I have a desire to have.

1666-06-06 12:25   Comes to our office 40 people almost of all sorts and qualities to hear the news, which I took great delight to tell them. 

1666-06-06 09:50 r We were all so overtaken with this good news, that the Duke ran with it to the King, who was gone to chappell, and there all the Court was in a hubbub, being rejoiced over head and ears in this good news.

1666-06-06 09:25   It is conceived reasonably, that of all the Dutch fleet, which, with what recruits they had, come to one hundred sail, there is not above fifty got home; and of them, few if any of their flags.

1666-06-06 09:10   Into the Parke, walking through to White Hall, and there every body listening for guns, but none heard, and every creature is now overjoyed and concludes upon very good grounds that the Dutch are beaten because we have heard no guns nor no news of our fleet.

1666-06-06 07:35   To St. James’s, where we all met, and did our business as usual with the Duke, and among other things had Captain Cocke’s proposal of Lord Bruncker, which I make use of as a monkey do the cat’s foot.

1666-06-05 23:22   Home, and so eat a bit and to bed, having received no manner of news this day, but of The Rainbow’s being put in from the fleet, maimed as the other ships are, and some say that Sir W. Clerke is dead of his leg being cut off.

1666-06-05 17:15   By water down to Deptford, and thence down to Longreach, calling on all the ships in the way, seeing their condition for sayling, and what they want.

1666-06-05 12:05   To the office, where all the morning, expecting every hour more news of the fleet and the issue of yesterday’s fight, but nothing come.

1666-06-04 21:30   Creed and I walked into the Park, it being fine moonshine, discoursing of the unhappinesse of our fleet, what it would have been if the Prince had not come in, how much the Duke hath failed of what he was so presumptuous of.

1666-06-04 18:38   With Mr. Hooke to my house and there lent some of my tables of naval matters, the names of rigging and the timbers about a ship, in order to Dr. Wilkins’ book coming out about the Universal Language.

1666-06-04 16:02   Home to dinner, and was followed by several people to be told the news, and good news it is. God send we may hear a good issue of this day’s business!

1666-06-04 14:10 r The King did pull out of his pocket about twenty pieces in gold, and did give it Daniel for himself and his companion; and so parted, mightily pleased with the account he did give him of the fight, and the success it ended with.

1666-06-04 14:05 r No particular person spoken of to be hurt but Sir W. Clerke, who hath lost his leg, and bore it bravely. The Duke himself had a little hurt in his thigh, but signified little.

1666-06-04 14:00 r But the Prince come up with the Generall’s fleet, and the Dutch come together again and bore towards their own coast, and we with them; and now what the consequence of this day will be, at that time fighting, we know not.

1666-06-04 13:55 r The Duke himself, then those people were put into the catch, and by and by spied the Prince’s fleet coming, upon which De Ruyter called a little council (being in chase at this time of us), and thereupon their fleet divided into two squadrons.

1666-06-04 13:50 r The fight continued till night, and then again the next morning from five till seven at night. And so, too, yesterday morning they begun again, and continued till about four o’clock, they chasing us for the most part, we flying from them.

1666-06-04 13:45 r We found the Dutch fleet at anchor half seas over, between Dunkirke and Ostend, and made them let slip their anchors. They about ninety, and we less than sixty.

1666-06-04 13:40 r I went and fetched the seamen into the Vane room to the King, and there he heard the whole account.

1666-06-04 13:03   News is brought me of a couple of men come to speak with me from the fleet; who should it be but Mr Daniel, all muffled up, and his face as black as the chimney, and covered with dirt, pitch, and tar, and powder, and muffled with dirty clouts, and his right eye stopped with okum.

1666-06-04 10:50   Major Halsey did bring news that he did see the Prince and his fleet at nine of the clock yesterday morning, four or five leagues to sea behind the Goodwin, so that by the hearing of the guns this morning we conclude he is come to the fleet.

1666-06-04 09:16   So far as to yesterday it is a miraculous thing that we did hear every where most plainly the guns go off, and yet at Deale and Dover to last night they did not hear one word of a fight, nor think they heard one gun. 

1666-06-04 09:12 r I saw a letter, dated last night, from Strowd, Governor of Dover Castle, which says that the Prince come thither the night before with his fleet, but that for the guns which we writ that we heard, it is only a mistake for thunder.

1666-06-04 08:45   Walking through the Park we saw hundreds of people listening at the Gravel-pits, and to and again in the Park to hear the guns.

1666-06-03 19:15   Home by the ’Change, which is full of people still, and all talk highly of the failure of the Prince in not making more haste after his instructions did come, and of our managements here in not giving it sooner and with more care and oftener thence.

1666-06-03 18:30   Meeting Creed, he and I by coach to Hide Parke alone to talke of these things, and do bless God that my Lord Sandwich was not here at this time to be concerned in a business like to be so misfortunate.

1666-06-03 17:18 r Have lost above 100 men, and a good many women (God knows what is become of Balty), and at last quenched his own fire and got to Aldbrough; being, as all say, the greatest hazard that ever any ship escaped, and as bravely managed by him.

1666-06-03 17:15   A letter from Harman in the Henery; that being fallen into the body of the Dutch fleet, he made his way through them, was set on by three fire-ships, got two of them off, and disabled the third; was set on fire himself; upon which many of his men leapt into the sea and perished.

1666-06-03 16:48 r It is also reported by some Victuallers that the Duke of Albemarle and Holmes their flags were shot down, and both fain to come to anchor to renew their rigging and sails.

1666-06-03 16:36   Met with this bad news farther, that the Prince come to Dover but at ten o’clock last night, and there heard nothing of a fight; so that we are defeated of all our hopes of his helpe to the fleet.

1666-06-03 15:20   To Mrs. Martin, and there did what je voudrais avec her, both devante and backward, which is also muy bon plazer. So by and by he come in, and after some discourse with him I away to White Hall.

1666-06-03 14:45   After dinner my father, wife, sister, and Mercer by water to Woolwich, while I walked by land, and saw the Exchange as full of people, and hath been all this noon as of any other day, only for news.

1666-06-03 09:10   The only news from the fleet is brought by Captain Elliott, of The Portland, which, by being run on board by The Guernsey, was disabled from staying abroad; so is come in to Aldbrough. That he saw one of the Dutch great ships blown up, and three on fire.

1666-06-02 19:10   Down to Blackewall, and there saw the soldiers (who were by this time gotten most of them drunk) shipped off. Lord! to see how the poor fellows kissed their wives and sweethearts in that simple manner at their going off, and shouted, and let off their guns, was strange sport.

1666-06-02 18:20   A return is come from Prince Rupert, that he did intend to sail from St. Ellen’s point; which gives us great hopes, the wind being very fair, that he is with them this even, and the fresh going off of the guns makes us believe the same.

1666-06-02 16:04   I went on shore with Captain Erwin at Greenwich, and into the Parke, and there we could hear the guns from the fleete most plainly. Thence he and I to the King’s Head and there bespoke a dish of steaks for our dinner.

1666-06-02 13:32   Down to Greenwich, and there appointed two yachts to be ready; and did order the soldiers to march to Blackewall.

1666-06-02 11:45   Presently come orders for our sending away to the fleet a recruite of 200 soldiers. So I rose from the table, and to the Victualling office, and thence upon the River among several vessels, to consider of the sending them away.

1666-06-02 09:08 r They are, ere this, certainly engaged; besides, several do averr they heard the guns all yesterday in the afternoon. This put us at the Board into a tosse.

1666-06-02 09:05   Certain news is brought us of a letter come to the King from the Duke of Albemarle, dated yesterday at eleven o’clock, as they were sailing to the Gunfleet, that they were in sight of the Dutch fleete, and were fitting themselves to fight them.

1666-06-01 14:25   My uncle and Woolly and I out into their yard, to talk about what may be done hereafter to all our profits by prizegoods, which did give us reason to lament the losse of the opportunity of the last year.

1666-06-01 13:34 r Here dined the fair Mrs. Margaret Wight, who is a very fine lady, but the cast of her eye, got only by an ill habit, do her much wrong and her hands are bad; but she hath the face of a noble Roman lady.

1666-06-01 13:29   I and my father, wife and sister, dined at Aunt Wight’s here hard by at Mr. Woolly’s, upon sudden warning, they being to go out of town to-morrow.
