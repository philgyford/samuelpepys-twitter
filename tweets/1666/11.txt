1666-11-30 21:50   I called at Mrs. Burroughs’ mother’s door, and Mrs. Burroughs come out to me, and I did hazer whatever I would con su mano tocando mi cosa; and then parted, and home.

1666-11-30 20:40   I did go drink at the Swan, and there did meet with Sarah, who is now newly married, and there I did lay the beginnings of a future amour con ella, which in time may come para laisser me hazer alguna cosa con elle.

1666-11-30 14:34 r Here I had a noble and costly dinner for them, dressed by a man-cooke, as that the other day was, and pretty merry we were, as I could be with this company and so great a charge.

1666-11-30 12:25 r Mrs. Turner was mighty angry with me, that in all this time I never writ to her, which I do think and take to myself as a fault, and which I have promised to mend.

1666-11-30 12:20 r  Mrs. Turner is come to town to look after her things in her house, but all is lost. She is quite weary of the country, but cannot get her husband to let her live here any more, which troubles her mightily.

1666-11-30 11:55   I home, and just overtook my cozen Roger Pepys, Mrs. Turner, Dicke, and Joyce Norton, coming by invitation to dine with me. These ladies I have not seen since before the plague.

1666-11-30 11:15   Pretty to see, it being St. Andrew’s day, how some few did wear St. Andrew’s crosse; but most did make a mockery at it, and the House of Parliament, contrary to practice, did sit: people having no mind to observe the Scotch saints’ days till they hear better news from Scotland.

1666-11-29 20:20   My Lord St. John did openly pull a gentleman in Westminster Hall by the nose, one Sir Andrew Henly, while the judges were upon their benches, and the other gentleman did give him a rap over the pate with his cane, of which fray the judges, they say, will make a great matter.

1666-11-29 15:30   I calling at our man-cooke’s for his help tomorrow, but he could not come. So I home to the office, my people all busy to get a good dinner tomorrow again.

1666-11-29 12:04   Home to dinner, where I find Balty come out to see us, but looks like death, and I do fear he is in a consumption; he has not been abroad many weeks before, and hath now a well day, and a fit day of the headake in extraordinary torture.

1666-11-28 21:26   Home and there comes my Lady Pen, Pegg, and Mrs. Turner, and played at cards and supped with us, and were pretty merry, and Pegg with me in my closet a good while, and did suffer me a la besar mucho et tocar ses cosas upon her breast, wherein I had great pleasure.

1666-11-28 18:02   Mr. Carteret and I to Gresham College, where they meet now weekly again, and here they had good discourse how this late experiment of the dog, which is in perfect good health, may be improved for good uses to men, and other pretty things.

1666-11-28 16:45 r A great deal of fine discourse, sitting almost till dark at dinner, and then broke up with great pleasure, especially to myself.

1666-11-28 14:20 r We eat with great pleasure, and I enjoyed myself in it with reflections upon the pleasures which I at best can expect, yet not to exceed this; eating in silver plates, and all things mighty rich and handsome about me.

1666-11-28 13:30   Comes my Lord Hinchingbroke, Sir Thomas Crew, Mr. John Crew, Mr. Carteret, and Brisband. I had six noble dishes for them, dressed by a man-cook, and commended, as indeed they deserved, for exceeding well done.

1666-11-28 08:10   With Sir W. Pen to White Hall, where, though it blows hard and rains hard, yet the Duke of York is gone a-hunting. We therefore lost our labour.

1666-11-27 21:23   This evening was brought me a letter sealed and directed to the Principal Officers and Commissioners of the Navy. It is a serious and just libel against our disorder in paying of our money, making ten times more people wait than we have money for.

1666-11-27 17:13   I spoke to Sir Thomas Crew, to invite him and his brother John to dinner tomorrow, at my house, to meet Lord Hinchingbroke; and so homewards, calling at the cook’s, who is to dress it, to bespeak him, and then home, and there set things in order for a very fine dinner.

1666-11-27 15:32   My Lord Crew doubting that all will break in pieces in the kingdom; and that the taxes now coming out, which will tax the same man in several capacities, as for lands, office, profession, and money at interest, will be the hardest that ever come out; and do think that we owe it.

1666-11-27 10:10   I had a letter from Mr. Brisband which, by the by, intimates my Lord Hinchingbroke’s intention to come and dine with me tomorrow. This put me into a great surprise.

1666-11-26 21:20   No news from the North at all today; and the news-book makes the business nothing, but that they are all dispersed. I pray God it may prove so.

1666-11-26 15:15   Into the House of Parliament, where, at a great Committee, I did hear the great case against my Lord Mordaunt, for some proceedings of his against one Taylor, whom he imprisoned, and did all the violence to imaginable, only to get him to give way to his abusing his daughter.

1666-11-26 10:04   To the Swan, having sent for some burnt claret, and Doll Lane and I sat and drank and talked a great while, among other things about her sister’s being brought to bed, and I to be godfather to the girl. I did tumble Doll, and do almost what I would with her, and so parted.

1666-11-25 17:58   I spoke with Mr. May who tells me that the design of building the City do go on apace, and by his description it will be mighty handsome, and to the satisfaction of the people; but I pray God it come not out too late.

1666-11-25 17:30   Here I saw Mrs. Stewart, methought the beautifullest creature that ever I saw in my life, more than ever I thought her so, often as I have seen her; and I begin to think do exceed my Lady Castlemayne, at least now.

1666-11-25 17:10   All the talk being of Scotland, where the highest report, I perceive, runs but upon three or four hundred in armes; but they believe that it will grow more, and do seem to apprehend it much, as if the King of France had a hand in it.

1666-11-25 16:25 r The King did of himself bid me to declare to all that would take our tallys for payment, that he should, soon as the Parliament’s money do come in, take back their tallys, and give them money.

1666-11-25 16:04   Into the Court and there delivered copies of my report to my Lord Treasurer, to the Duke of York, Sir W. Coventry, and others, and attended there till the Council met, and then was called in, and I read my letter.

1666-11-25 13:50 r Sir G. Carteret tells me more and more of our want of money and in how ill condition we are likely to be soon in, and that he believes we shall not have a fleet at sea the next year. So do I believe; but he seems to speak it as a thing expected by the King.

1666-11-25 13:13   Mr. Ashburnham do say that he never saw any one have so much zeale in his life as the Queene hath: and, the question being asked by my Lady Carteret, much beyond the bigotry that ever the old Queen-mother had.

1666-11-25 12:45   To Sir G. Carteret’s to dinner; where much company. Among others, Mr. Carteret and my Lady Jemimah, and here was also Mr. Ashburnham, the great man, who is a pleasant man, and that hath seen much of the world, and more of the Court.

1666-11-25 09:03   I heard one of the King’s chaplains, one Mr. Floyd, preach. He was out two or three times in his prayer, but yet he made a most excellent good sermon, of our duty to imitate the lives and practice of Christ and the saints departed, and did it very handsomely and excellent style.

1666-11-24 22:01   Home to supper, and then to read the late printed discourse of witches by a member of Gresham College, and then to bed; the discourse being well writ, in good style, but methinks not very convincing.

1666-11-24 16:22   With my report to my Lord Treasurer’s, where I did deliver it to Sir Philip Warwicke for my Lord, who was busy, my report for him to consider against tomorrow’s council.

1666-11-24 13:15 r The discourse of Scotland, it seems, is confirmed, and that they are 4000 of them in armes, and do declare for King and Covenant, which is very ill news. I pray God deliver us from the ill consequences we may justly fear from it.

1666-11-24 12:05   With Sir J. Minnes by coach to Stepney to the Trinity House, where it is kept again now since the burning of their other house in London. Here a great many met at Sir Thomas Allen’s feast, of his being made an Elder Brother; but he is sick, and so could not be there.

1666-11-23 19:24   At the Temple I called at Playford’s, and there find that his new impression of his ketches are not yet out, the fire having hindered it, but his man tells me that it will be a very fine piece, many things new being added to it.

1666-11-23 11:32   To the Hall, and there walked awhile, and all the talk is about Scotland, what news thence; but there is nothing come since the first report, and so all is given over for nothing.

1666-11-22 20:40   Mr Batelier tells me how the King of France hath, in defiance to the King of England, caused his footmen to be put into vests, and the noblemen of France will do the like; which is the greatest indignity ever done by one Prince to another, and would incite a stone to be revenged.

1666-11-22 12:20   Home to dinner, where my wife and I fell out, I being displeased with her cutting away a lace handkercher sewed about the neck down to her breasts almost, out of a belief, but without reason, that it is the fashion.

1666-11-22 12:03 r Lord Bruncker tells me that Hollar was yesterday sworn the King’s servant, and that the King hath commanded him to go on with his great map of the City, which he was upon before the City was burned, like Gombout of Paris, which I am glad of.

1666-11-22 11:57   To the office, where we sat all the morning, and my Lord Bruncker did show me Hollar’s new print of the City, with a pretty representation of that part which is burnt, very fine indeed.

1666-11-21 22:12   After supper an hour reading to my wife and brother something in Chaucer with great pleasure, and so to bed.

1666-11-21 10:40   I away to Westminster Hall, and there walked with several people, and all the discourse is about some trouble in Scotland I heard of yesterday, but nobody can tell the truth of it.

1666-11-21 09:10 r Sir P. Howard expressed kindness to Balty when I told him how sick he is. He says that before he comes to be mustered he must bring a certificate of his swearing the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and having taken the Sacrament according to the rites of the Church of England.

1666-11-21 08:45 r Sir Philip Howard had several gentlemen of his owne waiting on him, and one playing finely on the gittar: he discourses as well as ever I heard man, in few words and handsome.

1666-11-21 08:22   With Sir W. Batten to Charing Cross, and thence I to wait on Sir Philip Howard, whom I find dressing himself in his night-gown and turban like a Turke, but one of the finest persons that ever I saw in my life.

1666-11-20 17:07   I did hear that there are some troubles like to be in Scotland, there being a discontented party already risen, that have seized on the Governor of Dumfreeze and imprisoned him, but the story is yet very uncertain, and therefore I set no great weight on it.

1666-11-20 15:32   By coach to Barkeshire-house, and there did get a very great meeting; the Duke of York being there, and much business done, though not in proportion to the greatness of the business, and my Lord Chancellor sleeping and snoring the greater part of the time.

1666-11-20 11:05   Home, where I met Mr. Gregory, who I did then agree with to come to teach my wife to play on the Viall, and he being an able and sober man, I am mightily glad of it.

1666-11-20 09:20   To church it being thanksgiving-day for the cessation of the plague; but the town do say that it is hastened before the plague is quite over, there dying some people still, but only to get ground for plays to be publicly acted which the Bishops would not suffer till it was over.

1666-11-19 19:01   Sir Thomas Crew told me how hot words grew again today in the House of Lords between my Lord Ossory and Ashly, the former saying that something said by the other was said like one of Oliver’s Council. Ashly said that he must give him reparation, or he would take it his own way.

1666-11-19 15:45   I walked with Sir G. Carteret, who I find displeased with the letter I have drawn and sent in yesterday, finding fault with the account we give of the ill state of the Navy, but I said little, only will justify the truth of it.

1666-11-19 14:22   I to the Bull-head tavern, where I have not been since Mr. Chetwind and the time of our club, and here had six bottles of claret filled, and I sent them to Mrs. Martin, whom I had promised some of my owne, and, having none of my owne, sent her this.

1666-11-18 18:15 r And so I delivered my letter to Mr. Cheving, and he to Sir W. Coventry, in the cabinet, the King and council being sitting, where I leave it to its fortune, and I by water home again.

1666-11-18 16:50 r Sir W. Pen, it seems, he would not stay for the letter. So, making slight of Sir W. Pen’s putting so much weight upon his hand to Sir W. Batten, I down to the Tower Wharf, and there got a sculler, and to White Hall, and there met Lord Bruncker, and he signed it.

1666-11-18 15:38 r To finish my letter; and it being three o’clock ere we had done, when I come to Sir W. Batten; he was in a huffe, which I made light of, but he signed the letter, though he would not go, and liked the letter well.

1666-11-18 07:20 r To White Hall, where by appointment I met Lord Bruncker, and there I read over my great letter, and they approved it. And as I do do our business in defence of the Board, so I think it is as good a letter in the manner, as ever come from any office to a Prince.

1666-11-17 23:58 r It was a convenience tonight that what I had writ foule in shorthand, I could read to W. Hewer, and he take it fair in shorthand, so as I can read it tomorrow to Sir W. Coventry, and then come home, and Hewer read it to me while I take it in longhand, which saves me much time.

1666-11-17 23:56   I shut myself in my chamber, finishing my great letter to the Duke of York, which do lay the ill condition of the Navy so open to him, that it is impossible if the King and he minds any thing of their business.

1666-11-16 14:30   I met with Mr. Hooke, and he tells me the dog which was filled with another dog’s blood, at the College the other day, is very well, and like to be so as ever, and doubts not its being found of great use to men.

1666-11-16 13:15   To the new tavern come by us; the Three Tuns, where D. Gawden did feast us all with a chine of beef and other good things, and an infinite dish of fowl, but all spoiled in the dressing.

1666-11-16 00:25 r So away home with my wife, between displeased with the dull dancing, and satisfied at the clothes and persons. My Lady Castlemayne, without whom all is nothing, being there, very rich, though not dancing.

1666-11-15 23:35 r But the clothes and sight of the persons was indeed very pleasing, and worth my coming, being never likely to see more gallantry while I live, if I should come twenty times.

1666-11-15 23:14 r Only Mrs. Stewart danced mighty finely, and many French dances, specially one the King called the New Dance, which was very pretty; but upon the whole matter, the business of the dancing of itself was not extraordinary pleasing.

1666-11-15 23:10 r After the Bransles, then to a Corant, and now and then a French dance; but that so rare that the Corants grew tiresome, that I wished it done.

1666-11-15 21:55 r And of the ladies, the Queen, Duchess of York, Mrs. Stewart, Duchess of Monmouth, Lady Essex Howard, Mrs. Temples, Swedes Embassadress, Lady Arlington, Lord George Barkeley’s daughter, and many others I remember not; but all most excellently dressed in rich petticoats and gowns.

1666-11-15 21:50 r As many of the men as I can remember presently were, the King, Duke of York, Prince Rupert, Duke of Monmouth, Duke of Buckingham, Lord Douglas, Mr. Hamilton, Colonell Russell, Mr. Griffith, Lord Ossory, Lord Rochester.

1666-11-15 21:04 r Presently after the King was come in, he took the Queen, and about fourteen more couple there was, and began the Bransles.

1666-11-15 20:35 r And the King in his rich vest of some rich silk and silver trimming, as the Duke of York and all the dancers were, some of cloth of silver, and others of other sorts, exceeding rich.

1666-11-15 20:22 r Anon the house grew full, and the candles light, and the King and Queen and all the ladies set: and it was a glorious sight to see Mrs. Stewart in black and white lace, and her head and shoulders dressed with dyamonds, and the like a great many ladies more, only the Queen none.

1666-11-15 19:50 r I also to the ball, and with much ado got up to the loft, where with much trouble I could see very well.

1666-11-15 19:02   To Mrs. Pierce’s, where I find her as fine as possible, and himself going to the ball at night at Court, it being the Queen’s birthday, and so, having set them into the house, and gotten Mr. Pierce to undertake the carrying in my wife, I to Unthanke’s and there told her.

1666-11-14 23:12 r James Houblon took me aside and to talk of businesses of their own where I am to serve them, and I find that they and all merchants else do give over trade and the nation for lost, nothing being done with care or foresight, no convoys granted, nor any thing done to satisfaction.

1666-11-14 21:56 r The first dogg died upon the place, and the other well. This did give occasion to many pretty wishes, as of the blood of a Quaker to be let into an Archbishop; but, as Dr. Croone says, may be of use to man’s health, for the amending of bad blood by borrowing from a better body.

1666-11-14 21:52 r Dr. Croone told me that at the meeting at Gresham College tonight there was a pretty experiment of the blood of one dogg let out, till he died, into the body of another on one side, while all his own run out on the other side.

1666-11-14 20:36   To the Pope’s Head, where all the Houblons were, and Dr. Croone, and by and by to an exceeding pretty supper, excellent discourse of all sorts, and indeed are a set of the finest gentlemen that ever I met withal in my life.

1666-11-14 14:57   I to teach Knipp my new recitative of “It is decreed,” of which she learnt a good part, and I do well like it and believe shall be well pleased when she hath it all, and that it will be found an agreeable thing.

1666-11-14 11:22   Knipp tells me how Smith, of the Duke’s house, hath killed a man upon a quarrel in play; which makes every body sorry, he being a good actor, and, they say, a good man, however this happens.

1666-11-14 10:50   To Knipp’s again, and there staid reading of Waller’s verses, while she finished dressing, her husband being by. I had no other pastime. Her lodging very mean, and the condition she lives in; yet makes a shew without doors, God bless us!

1666-11-14 09:27   To Westminster, where I bought several things, as a hone, ribbon, gloves, books, and then took coach and to Knipp’s lodging, whom I find not ready to go home with me.

1666-11-13 19:57   Come all the Houblons to me, to invite me to sup with them tomorrow night. I did take them home, and there we sat and talked a good while, and a glass of wine, and then parted till tomorrow night.

1666-11-13 16:40   I receive notice from my Lord Hinchingbroke that he is not well, and so not in condition to come to dine with me tomorrow, which I am not in much trouble for, because of the disorder my house is in, by the bricklayers coming to mend the chimney in my dining-room for smoking.

1666-11-13 13:58   Out to Bishopsgate Street, and there bought some drinking-glasses, a case of knives, and other things, against tomorrow, in expectation of my Lord Hinchingbroke’s coming to dine with me.

1666-11-13 01:01 r I am in great pain to think how to dispose of my money, it being wholly unsafe to keep it all in coin in one place. But now I have it all at my hand, I shall remember it better to think of disposing of it.

1666-11-12 23:50   After my wife and all the maids abed but Jane, whom I put confidence in, she and I, and my brother, and Tom, and W. Hewer, did bring up all the remainder of my money, and my plate-chest, out of the cellar, and placed the money in my study, and the plate in my dressing-room.

1666-11-12 15:33 r A great man in his time, and Lord Chancellor; and his skeleton now exposed to be handled and derided by some, though admired for its duration by others. Many flocking to see it.

1666-11-12 15:30   In the Convocation House Yard we did see the body of Robert Braybrooke, Bishop of London, that died 1404. He fell down in his tomb out of the great church into St. Fayth’s this late fire, and is here seen his skeleton with the flesh on; but all tough like a spongy dry leather.

1666-11-12 11:48   I received 450 pieces of gold more of Mr. Stokes, but cost me 22½d. change; but I am well contented with it — I having now near 2800l. in gold, and will not rest till I get full 3000l, and then will venture my fortune for the saving that and the rest.

1666-11-12 11:15   Going to Sir R. Viner’s, I did get such a splash and spots of dirt upon my new vest, that I was out of countenance to be seen in the street.

1666-11-12 10:38   Everybody says my Lady Denham is poisoned, and Creed tells me she hath said it to the Duke of York; but is upon the mending hand, though the town says she is dead this morning.

1666-11-12 09:20   I find Mr. Carcasse a cunning, confident, shrewd man, but one that I do doubt hath by his discourse of the ill will he hath got with my Lord Marquess of Dorchester, he hath had cunning practices in his time, and would not now spare to use the same to his profit.

1666-11-11 23:52   I late to finish my song, and then to bed also, and the business of the firing of the city, and the fears we have of new troubles and violences, and the fear of fire among ourselves, did keep me awake a good while, considering the sad condition I and my family should be in.

1666-11-11 20:22 r Wooly’s wife, a silly woman; and their discourse mean, and the fear of the troubles of the times hath made them not to bring their plate to town, since it was carried out upon the business of the fire, so that they drink in earth and a wooden can, which I do not like.

1666-11-11 20:10   My wife and brother and I to my uncle Wight’s, where my aunt is grown so ugly and their entertainment so bad that I am in pain to be there; nor will go thither again a good while, if sent for, for we were sent for tonight, we had not gone else.

1666-11-11 16:39   Home, and I to my chamber, and there did finish the putting time to my song of “It is decreed,” and do please myself at last and think it will be thought a good song.

1666-11-11 14:02   Anon to church, my wife and I and Betty Michell, her husband being gone to Westminster. Here at church (God forgive me) my mind did courir upon Betty Michell, so that I do hazer con mi cosa in la eglisa mëme.

1666-11-11 12:50   Home to dinner, and we carried in Pegg Pen, and there also come to us little Michell and his wife, and dined very pleasantly.

1666-11-11 09:22   To church, myself and wife, where the old dunce Meriton, brother to the known Meriton; of St. Martin’s, Westminster, did make a very good sermon, beyond my expectation.

1666-11-10 22:05   This is the fatal day that every body hath discoursed for a long time to be the day that the Papists, or I know not who, had designed to commit a massacre upon; but, however, I trust in God we shall rise to-morrow morning as well as ever.

1666-11-10 21:51   Read an hour, to make an end of Potter’s Discourse of the Number 666, which I like all along, but his close is most excellent; and, whether it be right or wrong, is mighty ingenious.

1666-11-10 16:26   Creed comes to me, and by him, as, also my Lady Pen, I hear that my Lady Denham is exceeding sick, even to death, and that she says, and every body else discourses, that she is poysoned; and Creed tells me that it is said that there hath been a design to poison the King.

1666-11-10 14:30   Mr. Temple’s wife; after dinner, fell to play on the harpsicon, till she tired everybody, that I left the house without taking leave, and no creature left standing by her to hear her.

1666-11-10 09:11   Sir W. Coventry come to tell us that the Parliament did fall foul of our accounts again yesterday; and we must arme to have them examined, which I am sorry for: it will bring great trouble to me, and shame upon the office.

1666-11-09 23:20 r We got well home, and in the way I did con mi mano tocar la jambe de Mercer sa chair. Elle retirait sa jambe modestement, but I did tocar sa peau with my naked hand. And the truth is, la fille hath something that is assez jolie.

1666-11-09 22:38 r To walk out with Mr. Batelier, myself resolving to go home on foot, and leave the women there. And so did; but at the Savoy got a coach, and come back and took up the women; and so, having understood that the fire was overcome, and all well, we merrily parted, and home.

1666-11-09 21:48 r After supper, another dance or two, and then news that the fire is as great as ever, which put us all to our wit’s-end; and I mightily anxious to go home, but the coach being gone, and it being about ten at night, and rainy dirty weather, I knew not what to do.

1666-11-09 20:32 r By and by comes news that the fire has slackened; so then we were a little cheered up again, and to supper, and pretty merry.

1666-11-09 19:59 r The ladies begun presently to be afeard: one fell into fits. The whole town in an alarme. Drums beat and trumpets, and the guards every where spread, running up and down in the street.

1666-11-09 19:40 r Going to dance again, comes news that White Hall was on fire; and presently more particulars, that the Horse-guard was on fire; and so we run up to the garret, and find it so; a horrid great fire; and by and by we saw and heard part of it blown up with powder.

1666-11-09 19:22 r Knipp and I to sing, and Mercer and Captain Downing (who loves and understands music) would by all means have my song of “Beauty, retire.” which Knipp had spread abroad; and he extols it above any thing he ever heard, and, without flattery, I know it is good in its kind.

1666-11-09 18:52 r After some trifling discourse, we to dancing, and very good sport, and mightily pleased I was with the company.

1666-11-09 17:30   Comes Mr. Batelier and Mercer, and away by coach to Mrs. Pierce’s, by appointment, where we find good company: a fair lady, my Lady Prettyman, Mrs. Corbet, Knipp; and for men, Captain Downing, Mr. Lloyd, Sir W. Coventry’s clerk, and one Mr. Tripp, who dances well.

1666-11-09 16:40   Home and with my brother to dinner, my wife being dressing herself against night; after dinner I to my closet all the afternoon, till the porter brought my vest back from the taylor’s, and then to dress myself very fine.

1666-11-09 12:20   Upon the ’Change, where I seldom have of late been, I find all people mightily at a loss what to expect, but confusion and fears in every man’s head and heart. Whether war or peace, all fear the event will be bad.

1666-11-08 21:15   Mr. Grey did assure me that he was told by one of the greater Ministers of State in England, and one of the King’s Cabinet, that we had little left to agree on between the Dutch and us towards a peace, but only the place of treaty; which do astonish me to hear.

1666-11-08 20:42   Sir W. Coventry did tell me how the business is about Sir J. Minnes; that he is to be a Commissioner, and my Lord Bruncker and Sir W. Pen are to be Controller joyntly, which I am very glad of; and do hope truly that the King’s business will be better done thereby.

1666-11-08 15:08   To the office awhile, and so home for my sword, and there find Mercer come to see her mistress. I was glad to see her there, and my wife mighty kind also, and for my part, much vexed that the jade is not with us still.

1666-11-07 20:33   Home, and there find Mr. Batelier come to bring my wife a very fine puppy of his mother’s spaniel, a very fine one indeed, which my wife is mighty proud of. He staid and supped with us, and they to cards.

1666-11-07 11:33 r The picture in chalke is the finest thing I ever saw in my life, I think; and did desire to buy it; but he says he must keep it awhile to correct his copper-plate by, and when that is done he will sell it me.

1666-11-07 11:29   I called at Faythorne’s, to buy some prints for my wife to draw by this winter, and here did see my Lady Castlemayne’s picture, done by him from Lilly’s, in red chalke and other colours, by which he hath cut it in copper to be printed.

1666-11-07 10:46 r Doll Lane went away, and I staid a good while after, and was seen going out by one of our neighbours near the office and two of the Hall people that I had no mind to have been seen by, but there was no hurt in it nor can be alledged from it.

1666-11-07 10:10   To Westminster Hall, and, it being fast day, there was no shops open, but meeting with Doll Lane, did go with her to the Rose tavern, and there drank and played with her a good while.

1666-11-06 15:02   After dinner down alone by water to Deptford, reading “Duchesse of Malfy,” the play, which is pretty good.

1666-11-05 20:59 r I home by coach, but met not one bonefire through the whole town in going round by the wall, which is strange, and speaks the melancholy disposition of the City at present, while never more was said of, and feared of, and done against the Papists than just at this time.

1666-11-05 20:20   I to White Hall where I staid walking up and down till night, and then got almost into the play house, having mind to go and see the play at Court this night; but fearing how I should get home, because of the bonefires and the lateness of the night to get a coach, I did not stay.

1666-11-05 17:15 r I took them upon Tower Hill to shew them what houses were pulled down there since the fire; and then to my house, where I treated them with good wine of several sorts, and they took it mighty respectfully, and a fine company of gentlemen they are.

1666-11-05 17:01   I find my Lord Hinchingbroke and Mr. John Crew and Dr. Crew going out to see the ruins of the City. I took the Doctor into my hackney coach (and he is a fine sober gentleman) and so through the City. But, Lord! what pretty observations he made of the City and its desolation.

1666-11-05 16:08 r And this was by an enemy, there having been one convicted and hanged upon this very score. This is an excellent salvo for the tenants, and for which I am glad, because of my father’s house.

1666-11-05 16:05   The judges have determined in the case whether the landlords or the tenants shall bear the loss of the fire; they say that tenants should against all casualties of fire beginning in their own or in their neighbour’s; but, where it is done by an enemy, they are not to do it.

1666-11-05 15:22 r And that both in City and country it was bragged by several Papists that upon such a day or in such a time we should find the hottest weather that ever was in England, and words of plainer sense.

1666-11-05 15:20 r Sir Thomas Crew do, from what he hath heard at the Committee for examining the burning of the City, conclude it as a thing certain that it was done by plots; it being proved by many witnesses that endeavours were made in several places to encrease the fire.

1666-11-05 15:00 r The true reason why the country gentlemen are for a land-tax and against a general excise is because they are fearful that if the latter be granted they shall never get it down again; whereas when the war ceases there will be no ground to keep the land-tax up.

1666-11-05 14:49   I do find by Sir Thomas Crew that all the country gentlemen are publicly jealous of the courtiers in the Parliament, and that they do doubt every thing that they propose.

1666-11-05 11:09 r I was moved with my Lady Peterborough’s story, which she handsomely told me, and promised I would try what I could do in a few days, and so took leave, being willing to keep her Lord fair with me, both for his respect to my Lord Sandwich and for my owne sake hereafter.

1666-11-05 11:03   My Lady Peterborough makes mighty moan of the badness of the times, and her family as to money – my Lord’s passionateness for want thereof, and his want of coming in of rents, and no wages from the Duke of York.

1666-11-05 09:32   By water to Westminster, and there at the Swan find Sarah is married to a shoemaker yesterday, so I could not see her, but I believe I shall hereafter at good leisure.

1666-11-04 22:04   Home, and there began to read “Potter’s Discourse upon 666,” which pleases me mightily, and then broke off and to supper and to bed.

1666-11-04 15:39   Mr. Cooling, my Lord Chamberlain’s secretary tells me my Lord Generall is grown a drunken sot, and drinks with nobody but Troutbecke, whom nobody else will keep company with.

1666-11-04 13:44   To White Hall, and was mighty fearful of an ague, my vest being new and thin, and the coat cut not to meet before upon my breast.

1666-11-04 09:50   Comes my taylor’s man, and brings my vest home, and coat to wear with it, and belt, and silver-hilted sword. So I rose and dressed myself, and I like myself mightily in it, and so do my wife.

1666-11-03 12:10   I to the office, where all the morning to little purpose, nothing being before us but clamours for money.

1666-11-03 09:38   Comes Mr. Lovett, and brings me my print of the Passion, varnished by him, and the frame black, which indeed is very fine, though not so fine as I expected; however, pleases me exceedingly.

1666-11-02 15:26   I walked a good while with the Serjeant Trumpet, who tells me, as I wished, that the King’s Italian here is about setting three parts for trumpets, and shall teach some to sound them, and believes they will be admirable musique.

1666-11-02 11:04   We to Deptford (it being very cold upon the water), and there did also a little more business, and so home, I reading all the way to make end of the “Bondman” (which the oftener I read the more I like), and begun “The Duchesse of Malfy;” which seems a good play.

1666-11-02 09:58   Sir W. Batten and I did buy some apples and pork; by the same token the butcher commended it as the best in England for cloath and colour. And for his beef, says he, “Look how fat it is; the lean appears only here and there a speck, like beauty-spots.”

1666-11-02 08:02   With Sir W. Batten to Woolwich, where first we went on board the Ruby, French prize, the only ship of war we have taken from any of our enemies this year. It seems a very good ship, but with galleries quite round the sterne to walk in as a balcone, which will be taken down.

1666-11-01 21:50 r I left Sir W. Coventry with a thousand sad reflections upon the times, and the state of the King’s matters, and so away and took up my wife and home where a little at the office, and then home to supper, and talk with my wife (with whom I have much comfort), and so to bed.

1666-11-01 19:48 r Sir W. Coventry says the House goes on slowly in finding of money, and that the discontented party do say they have not done with us, for they will have a further bout with us as to our accounts, and they are exceedingly well instructed where to hit us.

1666-11-01 19:26 r I find Sir W. Coventry very melancholy under the same considerations of the King’s service that I am. He confesses with me he expects all will be undone, and all ruined.

1666-11-01 18:37   My wife being come back, I took her and set her at her brother’s, who is very sick, and I to White Hall, and there all alone a pretty while with Sir W. Coventry at his chamber.

1666-11-01 14:20   My wife and my brother, and W. Hewer and Barker away to Betty Michell’s, to Shadwell, and I to my office, where I took in Mrs. Bagwell and did what I would with her.

1666-11-01 07:50   Up, and was presented by Burton, one of our smith’s wives, with a very noble cake, which I presently resolved to have my wife go with today, and some wine, and house-warme my Betty Michell, which she readily resolved to do.
