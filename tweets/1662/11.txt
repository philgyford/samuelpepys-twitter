1662-11-30 22:07   I am somewhat uncertain what to think of my going about to take a woman-servant into my house, in the quality of a woman for my wife.

1662-11-30 21:43   I do find that, through the fitting of my house this month, I have spent in that and kitchen 50l.; so that now I am worth but 660l.

1662-11-30 16:38   This day I first did wear a muffe, being my wife’s last year’s muffe, and now I have bought her a new one, this serves me very well.

1662-11-30 13:01   Dined alone with my wife to-day with great content, my house being quite clean from top to bottom.

1662-11-29 21:20   My wife’s brother brings word that Gosnell, which my wife and I do pleasantly call our Marmotte, will certainly come next week without fail.

1662-11-29 16:32   I did here see the great pleasure to be had in discoursing of publique matters with men that are acquainted with this or that business.

1662-11-29 15:48   To my Lord’s, where my Lord and Mr. Coventry, Sir Wm. Darcy, with several others, did meet about stating the business of the fishery.

1662-11-29 10:33   Sir G. Carteret tells us that the silver which he received for Dunkirk did weigh 120,000 weight.

1662-11-28 17:32   I staid all day expecting Gosnell’s coming. There came an excuse that she had not heard from her mother, but that she will come next week.

1662-11-28 07:39   A very hard frost; which is news to us after having none almost these three years.

1662-11-27 14:02   Lord! to see the absurd nature of Englishmen, that cannot forbear laughing and jeering at every thing that looks strange.

1662-11-27 13:53   I could not see the Embassador; but his attendants in their habits and fur caps very handsome men, and most with hawkes upon their fists.

1662-11-27 13:47   I walked to the Conduit in the Quarrefowr, at the end of Gracious-street and Cornhill; and there I saw them pretty well go by.

1662-11-27 12:19   To the next house upon Tower Hill, to see the coming by of the Russia Embassador; for whose reception all the City trained-bands do attend.

1662-11-27 06:38   At my waking, I found the tops of the houses covered with snow, which is a rare sight, that I have not seen these three years.

1662-11-26 23:58   My wife putting up the red hangings and bed in her woman’s chamber, and I my books in my chamber and study, which is now very pretty.

1662-11-26 23:56   All day long getting my house in order.

1662-11-25 21:07   Great talk among people how some of the Fanatiques do say that the end of the world is at hand, and that next Tuesday is to be the day.

1662-11-25 14:13   To Greatorex’s, where I staid and talked with him, and got him to mend my pocket ruler for me.

1662-11-25 12:58   With the rest, by Mr. Holy, the ironmonger’s invitation, to the Dolphin, to a venison pasty, very good, and rare at this time of the year.

1662-11-24 13:49   I to my Lord Crew’s, and dined with him, and had very good discourse, and he seemed to be much pleased with my visits.

1662-11-24 09:14   Mr. Slingsby did show the King the stamps of the new money that is now to be made by Blondeau’s fashion, which are neat, and like the King.

1662-11-24 07:50   Sir J. Minnes, Sir W. Batten, and I, hear that the King and Duke are come this morning to the Tower to see the Dunkirk money.

1662-11-23 19:13   I hear to-day how old rich Audley is lately dead, and left a very great estate, and made a great many poor familys rich, not all to one.

1662-11-23 15:24   My brother desires me to give him leave to look after his mistress still; which I did give him leave to do.

1662-11-22 20:53   This day I bought the book of country dances against my wife’s woman Gosnell comes, who dances finely.

1662-11-22 17:36   I went home and caused a new fashion knocker to be put on my door, and did other things to the putting my house in order.

1662-11-22 08:10   I see my wife set so against the wench, whom I take to be an extraordinary good servant, that I was forced to bid her get her another place.

1662-11-22 08:02   From some difference between my wife and Sarah, her maid, my wife and I fell out cruelly, to my great discontent.

1662-11-21 21:58   To supper and to bed: this night having first put up a spitting sheet, which I find very convenient.

1662-11-21 16:07   Within all day long, helping to put up my hangings in my house in my wife’s chamber, to my great content.

1662-11-20 20:48   I found that my wife had finished my study with the former hangings of the diningroom which will upon occasion serve for a withdrawing room.

1662-11-20 13:07   I broke to Mr. Coventry my desire for my wife’s brother to send him to sea as a midshipman, which he is willing to agree to.

1662-11-19 12:15   At home all the morning, putting some of my goods in order in my house.

1662-11-18 17:08   My wife came home having layed out above 12l. in linen, and a copper, and a pot, and bedstead, and other household stuff, which troubles me.

1662-11-17 23:40   We took coach and home, but could wake nobody at my house, and so were fain to have my boy get through one of the windows.

1662-11-17 23:02   To the Cockpitt, and saw the King, Queen, Duke of Monmouth, his son, and my Lady Castlemaine; and “The Scornfull Lady,” well performed.

1662-11-17 16:30   Home and there spent an hour or two, talking with my wife, and making Mrs. Gosnell sing. I am mightily pleased with her humour and singing.

1662-11-17 10:39   At home I found my wife dressing by appointment by her woman that I think is to be.

1662-11-17 09:52   I to my Lord Sandwich’s, and having spoke with him about his businesses, I to Westminster Hall and there staid long doing many businesses.

1662-11-16 13:48   I walked up and down my house, which is now almost finished, there being nothing to do but the glazier and furniture to put up.

1662-11-16 05:37   Waked with a rude noise among Sir J. Minnes his servants, who are the rudest people but they that lived before, that ever I knew in my life.

1662-11-15 21:08   I saw my painters make an end of my house, which is my great joy.

1662-11-14 08:42   My wife to reason it to me, to put her away, and take one of the Bowyers if I did dislike her, that I did resolve when the house is ready.

1662-11-14 08:29   I perceive by my wife’s discourse her letter was full of good counsel, and relating the reason of her desiring a woman.

1662-11-14 08:24   My wife begun to talk and to be friends, believing all this while that I had read her letter.

1662-11-13 20:29   I must think of some way, either to find my wife some body to keep her company, or to set her to work, to take up her thoughts and time.

1662-11-13 20:11   I purpose not to read it, but to burn it before my wife’s face, that I may put a stop to more of this nature.

1662-11-13 20:09   This afternoon my wife in her discontent sent me a letter, which I am in a quandary what to do, whether to read it or not.

1662-11-13 07:15   But I do perceive that it is want of work that do make my wife and all other people think of ways of spending their time worse.

1662-11-13 07:13   Up and began our discontent again and sorely angered my wife, who indeed do live very lonely.

1662-11-12 19:49   I made an end of my collection of the prices of masts for these twelve years, in order to the buying of some of Wood.

1662-11-12 17:48   I met with Wade and Evett, and have resolved to make a new attempt upon another discovery. God give us better fortune than in the other.

1662-11-12 16:09   I walked home, calling a little in Paul’s Churchyard, and, I thank God, can read and never buy a book, though I have a great mind to it.

1662-11-11 20:07   I, as I have done for three or four nights, studying something of Arithmetique, which do please me well to see myself come forward.

1662-11-11 15:48   Mr. Bland telling me fine things in merchandize, which, but that the trouble of my office do so cruelly hinder me, I would take pains in.

1662-11-10 22:14   The town is full of discontents, and all know of the King’s new bastard by Mrs. Haslerigge, and will never be contented with Episcopacy.

1662-11-10 20:09   Their puppets here are somewhat better, but their motions not at all.

1662-11-10 20:07   I carried my wife to Charing Cross, and showed her the Italian motion, much after the nature of what I showed her in Covent Garden.

1662-11-10 16:12   I found Jack Cole a little conceited, but he had good things in him, and a man may know the temper of the City by him.

1662-11-10 12:42   Discourse of France’s intention to make a patriarch of his own independent from the Pope by which he will be able to cope with the Spaniard.

1662-11-10 09:35   I perceive there are great fears abroad; for all which I am troubled and full of doubt that things will not go well.

1662-11-10 09:28   My Lord General Monk did talk with the Duke about having the life-guards pass through the City today only for show and to fright people.

1662-11-09 21:51   With Sir J. Minnes we did abundance of most excellent discourse of former passages of sea commanders and officers of the navy.

1662-11-09 15:10   Mr. Moore and I to St. Gregory’s, where I escaped a great fall down the staires of the gallery.

1662-11-08 14:15   All the morning sitting at the office, and dined alone at home, and so to the office again, being loth to go home, the house is so dirty.

1662-11-07 21:59   Instead of the house made clean, all the pewter goods and other things are brought up to scouring, which makes the house ten times worse.

1662-11-07 21:22   To my brother’s, where my wife, by my order, is tonight to stay a night or two while my house is made clean, and thence home.

1662-11-07 19:10   I do believe there must be money hid somewhere by Barkestead, or else he did delude this woman, which I am apt to believe.

1662-11-07 19:08   At last we saw we were mistaken; after digging the cellar quite through, we were forced to pay our porters, and give over our expectations.

1662-11-07 12:48   We sent for a dinner, and upon the head of a barrel dined very merrily, and to work again.

1662-11-07 09:10   The woman, Barkestead’s great confident, is brought, who do positively say that this is the place which he did say the money was hid in.

1662-11-07 08:56   Being by appointment called upon by Mr. Lee, he and I to the Tower, to make our third attempt upon the cellar.

1662-11-07 06:48   In my dream troubled by being with Will Swan, a great fanatic, my old acquaintance, and, methought, taken and led up with him for a plotter.

1662-11-06 21:40   At the office forenoon and afternoon till late at night, very busy answering my Lord Treasurer’s letter.

1662-11-05 18:32   With my painters painting my dining room all day long till night, not stirring out at all.

1662-11-04 10:53   But there will be no great miss of him for all that.

1662-11-04 10:52   Sir Richard Stayner is dead at sea in the Mary, which is come into Portsmouth from Lisbon; which we are sorry for, he being a stout seaman.

1662-11-03 22:03   By God’s great blessing my mind is in good condition of quiet.

1662-11-03 20:24   Though we have missed twice, yet they bring such an account of the probability of the truth of the thing, we shall set upon it once more.

1662-11-03 20:21   Came to me Mr. Wade and Evett, who have been again with their prime intelligencer, a woman, I perceive.

1662-11-03 16:08   I among my workmen, in making an end of many jobbs, so that after to-morrow I shall have but a little plastering and all the painting to do.

1662-11-03 09:34   At all which I am sorry; but it is the effect of idleness, and having nothing else to employ their great spirits upon.

1662-11-03 09:28   The Duke of York is smitten in love with my Lady Chesterfield; and so much, that the Duchess of York hath complained to the King about it.

1662-11-03 09:21   My Lady Castlemaine is with child; but though it be the King’s, yet her Lord being still in town, it will be laid to him.

1662-11-02 21:39   My wife and I spent a good deal of this evening in reading “Du Bartas’ Imposture” which my wife has taken up to read, and is very fine.

1662-11-02 21:32   Home and to bed, with some pain in making water, having taken cold this morning in sitting too long bare-legged to pare my corns.

1662-11-02 15:39   To church, and there being a lazy preacher I slept out the sermon.

1662-11-02 08:37   Lay long talking with my wife, in whom I never had greater content than now, she continuing with the same care and thrift and innocence.

1662-11-01 19:54   I do hear that Sir J. Minnes is resolved to turn part of our entry into a room and to divide the back yard between Sir W. Pen and him.

1662-11-01 17:05   As it was confidently directed, I myself did truly expect to speed; but we missed of all: and so we went away the second time like fools.

1662-11-01 17:03   We staid two or three hours digging, and dug a great deal all under the arches.

1662-11-01 14:40   Mr. Leigh and I, with Wade and his intelligencer and labourers, to the Tower cellars, to make one tryall more.

1662-11-01 13:05   One Mr. Oudant did discourse of the convenience as to keeping the highways from being deep, by their horses, in Holland.

1662-11-01 12:15   To the Trinity House, to a great dinner, by invitacion, and much company. One Captain Evans makes his Elder Brother’s dinner to-day.
