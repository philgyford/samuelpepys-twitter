1662-09-30 22:12 My brother Tom is gone out of town this day, to make a second journey to his mistress at Banbury, of which I have good expectations.

1662-09-30 21:48 Things are all quiett, but the King poor, and no hopes of his being otherwise, by which things will go to rack, especially in the Navy.

1662-09-30 18:19 Strange to see how easily my mind do revert to its practice of loving plays and wine, having given myself a liberty to them these two days.

1662-09-30 17:07 We took coach and to the Duke’s playhouse, where we saw “The Duchess of Malfy” well performed, but Betterton and Ianthe to admiration.

1662-09-30 05:38 Good God! how I do find myself by yesterday’s liberty hard to be brought to follow business again, but however, I must do it.

1662-09-29 19:29 Mr Deane hath sent the model he promised; it so far exceeds my expectations I am sorry he should make such a present to no greater a person.

1662-09-29 17:26 I saw, I confess, some good dancing and some handsome women, which was all my pleasure.

1662-09-29 17:24 We saw “Midsummer’s Night’s Dream,” which I had never seen before, nor shall ever again. The most insipid ridiculous play that ever I saw.

1662-09-29 10:53 To Tom’s, and taking up my wife, maid, dog, and him, did carry them home, where my wife is much pleased with my house, and so am I fully.

1662-09-29 06:41 This day my oaths for drinking of wine and going to plays are out, and so I do resolve to take a liberty, and then to fall to them again.

1662-09-28 14:48 I found my house made a little clean, and pleases me better and better.

1662-09-28 10:47 The French Church do have, which I never saw before, the minister do preach with his hat off, I suppose in conformity with our Church.

1662-09-28 10:32 To the French Church at the Savoy, where I never was before — a pretty place — and there they have the Common Prayer Book read in French.

1662-09-28 05:27 My wife tells me what a rogue my boy is, and strange things he has been found guilty of, not fit to name, which vexes.

1662-09-28 04:32 Waked early, and fell talking one with another with great pleasure of my house at Brampton and that here, and other matters.

1662-09-27 22:37 I perceive my Lord and Lady have been very kind to my wife, and Captn. Ferrers so kind that I perceive I have some jealousy of him.

1662-09-27 22:28 There has been falling out between my mother and my wife, and a little between my father and she; but I hope all is well again.

1662-09-27 21:17 I found my wife and her maid and dogg very well, and herself grown a little fatter than she was. I was very well pleased to see her.

1662-09-27 20:47 Will did, by my leave to go, meet my wife upon the road, and did bring me word she was come to my brother’s, by my order.

1662-09-27 05:12 Now the boy’s room being laid into the entry do make my coming in very handsome, which was the only fault remaining almost in my house.

1662-09-27 04:48 Up betimes and among my workmen, and with great pleasure see the posts in the entry taken down beyond expectation.

1662-09-26 22:09 Writing to Sir G. Carteret that I cannot wait upon him to-morrow morning to Chatham, because of my workmen and my wife’s coming to town.

1662-09-26 16:19 I did cause the partition between the entry and the boy’s room to be pulled down to lay it all into one, which I hope will please me.

1662-09-25 20:39 The woman, formerly nurse to Mrs. Lemon, her child was torn to pieces by two doggs at Walthamstow this week, and is dead, which is strange.

1662-09-25 19:15 In Portugal they scorn to make a seat for a house of office, but they do shit all in pots and so empty them in the river.

1662-09-24 21:59 Late at my office, inditing a letter from Tom to his mistress upon his sending her a watch for a token.

1662-09-24 16:38 I discoursed with my brother and Mr Cooke about their journey to Tom’s mistress. I did speak with Mr Croxton about measuring of silk flags.

1662-09-24 14:52 To Mr. Wotton, the shoemaker’s and bought a pair of boots. He told me how Bird hath lately broke his leg, while he was fencing in “Aglaura.”

1662-09-24 11:42 It is my content that by several hands I hear that I have the name of good-natured man among the poor people that come to the office.

1662-09-23 16:42 In most cabaretts in France they have writ upon the walls in fair letters, “Dieu te regarde,” as a good lesson to be in every man’s mind.

1662-09-23 05:27 Up betimes and with my workmen, taking pleasure to see my work come towards an end, though I am vexed every day enough with their delay.

1662-09-22 17:03 To see Mr. Young and Mr. Lull, kindred of Tom’s mistress, where I was well used and do find things to go in the business to my good content.

1662-09-22 13:55 To my Lord Crew’s, and sat an hour talking with him of publique, and my Lord’s private businesses, with much content.

1662-09-22 10:22 I walked to Greatorex’s, and there with him did overlook many pretty things, new inventions, and have bespoke a weather glass of him.

1662-09-22 08:03 But I stood in great pain, having a great fit of the colic, having catched cold yesterday by putting off my stockings to wipe my toes.

1662-09-22 08:02 With Sir J. M., Sir W. B., and Sir W. P., by coatch to St. James’s. I did give the Duke an account of all things past of late.

1662-09-22 04:59 Up betimes among my workmen, hastening to get things ready against my wife’s coming.

1662-09-21 19:28 All supper I did vex my aunt talking in commendation of the mass which I had been at to-day, but excused it that it was only to make mirth.

1662-09-21 17:39 I should have been very weary but that pretty Mrs. Margaret Wight came in and I was much pleased with her company.

1662-09-21 17:33 I went to my uncle Wight’s, where I found my aunt in mourning and making sad stories for the loss of her dear sister Nicholls.

1662-09-21 09:59 After mass was done, a fryer with his cowl did rise up and preach a sermon in Portuguese; which I not understanding, did go away.

1662-09-21 09:43 I heard their musique; which may be good, but it did not appear so to me, neither as to their singing, nor was it good concord to my ears.

1662-09-21 09:22 I saw the fine altar, ornaments, and the fryers in their habits, and the priests come in with their fine copes and many other fine things.

1662-09-21 08:49 The Queen coming by in her coach, going to her chappell at St. James’s (the first time it hath been ready for her), I crowded after her.

1662-09-21 07:03 To the Park, where by appointment I met my brother Tom and Mr. Cooke, and there spoke about Tom’s business, and to good satisfaction.

1662-09-20 20:41 Three or four that I knew in King Street in Westminster, tradesmen, are lately fallen mad, some of them dead, and the others continue mad.

1662-09-20 18:32 Tom brought Mr. Lull to me, a friend of his mistress, with whom I spoke. He gives me a good account of her and of their satisfaction in Tom.

1662-09-20 05:07 My brother Tom tells me that his mistress’s mother has wrote a letter to Mr. Lull of her full satisfaction about Tom, of which I was glad.

1662-09-19 22:18 It being a joy to my heart to think of the condition that I am now in, that people should of themselves provide this for me, unspoke to.

1662-09-19 22:17 After I had eaten a cold pullet, I walked by brave moonshine, with three or four armed men to guard me, to Redriffe.

1662-09-19 16:42 To Pay, my trouble being that I was forced to begin an ill practice of bringing down the wages of servants, for which people did curse me.

1662-09-19 13:07 I dined well, being chief at the table, and do not see but every body begins to give me as much respect and honour as any of the rest.

1662-09-19 09:49 None of the rest going, I went alone to Deptford, and there went on where they left last night to pay Woolwich yard.

1662-09-18 15:28 After a great dinner and much discourse, we arose and took leave, and home to the business of my office, where I thank God I take delight.

1662-09-18 13:28 There being want of corn in Paris, a collection made for the poor, there was two pearls brought in, which were sold for 200,000 crownes.

1662-09-18 12:49 Much noble and brave company, with the privilege of their rare discourse, which is great content to me above all other things in the world.

1662-09-18 12:09 Sir G. Carteret, Mr. Coventry, and I by invitation to dinner to Sheriff Maynell’s, the great money-man.

1662-09-17 21:47 This day my boy is come from Brampton, and my wife I think the next week.

1662-09-17 20:42 Let it be a caution to myself not to love drink, since it has such an effect upon others of greater worth in my own esteem.

1662-09-17 19:27 Though I honour Mr. Crumlum, and he do declare abundance of learning and worth, yet I confess my opinion is much lessened of him.

1662-09-17 19:23 At the tavern Mr. Crumlum met with an acquaintance of his that did occasion impertinent discourse.

1662-09-17 16:54 One Mr. Newell, come to see Mr. Crumlum, of whom he made so much, and of me, that he did drink more than I believe he used to do.

1662-09-17 15:09 Mr. Moore and I to Paul’s school, to wait upon Mr. Crumlum, who we take very luckily, and went up to his chamber with him.

1662-09-16 21:07 My wife writes me from the country that she is not pleased with my father nor mother, nor her servants, and that my boy is turned a rogue.

1662-09-16 19:48 Sir J. M. and I walked in the garden, very pleasant, and takes no notice that he do design any further trouble to me about my house.

1662-09-16 12:34 The housekeeper of this office did give me so good an account of my chamber about which I am so troubled that I am well at ease in my mind.

1662-09-15 08:22 I was fain to walk over the piles through the bridge, while Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes were aground against the bridge.

1662-09-15 06:05 The plasterer and bricklayer that did first divide our lodgings do both tell me that my chamber did ever belong to my lodgings.

1662-09-14 19:09 Goodenough the plasterer tells me that my best chamber did ever belong to my lodgings, and so I will strive hard for it before I lose it.

1662-09-14 18:39 Sir W. Pen told me what he had heard about my lodgings and Sir J. Minnes. I see that I shall hardly keep my best chamber, which troubles me.

1662-09-14 11:38 This the first day of having vialls and other instruments to play a symphony between every verse of the anthem.

1662-09-14 11:22 At White Hall chapel I heard Captain Cooke’s new musique. I could discern him to overdo his part at singing, which I never did before.

1662-09-14 10:07 I found Mr. Coventry to admiration good and industrious, and I think my most true friend in all things that are fair.

1662-09-14 08:42 At the Legg I drank a cup of ale and a toast, which I have not done many a month before, but it served me for my two glasses of wine to-day.

1662-09-13 20:13 It is great pleasure to me Mr. Moore’s company and discourse. We did talk about my law business, which I must now fall upon minding again.

1662-09-13 14:26 Studying how to go upon the leads, which I fear at last I must be contented to go without, but, however, my mind is troubled still about it.

1662-09-12 22:09 All the afternoon till 9 at night at my office, and then home and eat an egg or two, and so to my lodgings and to bed.

1662-09-12 13:23 Dined at home all in dirt, and my mind weary of being thus out of order. For the present I am very melancholy, as I have been a great while.

1662-09-12 11:32 At my office, Mr. Lewes teaching me to understand the method of making up Purser’s accounts, which is very needful for me and very hard.

1662-09-12 08:55 My mind is troubled till I see how Sir John Minnes will carry himself to me about my lodgings. My fear is that he will get my best chamber.

1662-09-12 06:10 Up betimes and to my office, and up to my workmen, which goes on slowly and troubles me much.

1662-09-11 20:44 Tom came to show me a civil letter sent him from his mistress. I am pleased well enough with the business.

1662-09-11 06:28 Up, but not so soon as I have of late practised, my trouble of mind and the shortness of the days making me to lie longer than I used to do.

1662-09-10 15:30 Mr. Young has made enquiry of my brother Tom, and do hear him so well spoken of that Mr. Townsend doubts not that the business will take.

1662-09-10 07:12 And yet I save part of the closet I hoped for, which, if it will not please Sir John Minnes, I am a madman to be troubled at it.

1662-09-10 07:10 Up and to my house, and there contrived a way how Sir John Minnes shall come into the leads.

1662-09-09 21:40 The more fool am I, and must labour against it for shame, especially I that used to preach Epictetus’s rule: τὰ ἐφ ἡμῖν κἰ τἀ οὐχ ἐφ ἡμῖν.

1662-09-09 21:30 It do vex me all this evening, so great a fool I am, and little master of my passion, for the thoughts of losing the privilege of the leads.

1662-09-09 21:28 This afternoon Sir John showed us how I have blinded all his lights, and stopped up his garden door, and other things he takes notice of.

1662-09-09 14:36 I do resolve to know that, so when we know the lowest rate, it shall be the Treasurer’s fault, and not ours, that we pay dearer.

1662-09-09 14:34 We met several tradesmen to know of them their lowest rates that they will take for their several provisions that they sell to us.

1662-09-09 12:40 Mr. Coventry, Sir J. Minnes, Mr. Pett, and myself by water to Deptford, where we met Sir G. C., Sir W. B., and Sir W. P.

1662-09-08 16:33 I did give Sir J. Minnes good satisfaction therein, so as that I am well pleased and do hope now to have my closet on the leads.

1662-09-08 16:22 Sir W. Pen did tell me Sir J. Minnes’ dislike of my blinding his lights over his stairs and blocking up the house of office on the leads.

1662-09-08 13:05 To the Change, and there meeting Sir W. Warren did step to a tavern, and there sat and talked about price of masts and other things.

1662-09-08 10:50 I told Mr Townsend my brother Tom’s intentions for a wife, which he would do me all favour in to Mr Young, whose kinswoman he do look after.

1662-09-08 09:44 To the Exchequer to meet Mr. Townsend. I hear he is gone to the Sun tavern, and found him with friends at breakfast, which I eat with him.

1662-09-08 08:55 The Duke do intend to renew the old custom for the Admirals to have their principal officers to meet them once a-week, which I am glad of.

1662-09-08 05:50 Up betimes and to my office preparing an account to give the Duke this morning of what we have of late done at the office.

1662-09-07 21:52 To my office, to fit myself for waiting on the Duke to-morrow morning with the rest of our company, and so to my lodgings and to bed.

1662-09-07 18:52 Here were great store of great ladies, but very few handsome.

1662-09-07 18:11 In comes the King, and the Duke and his Duchess; they being all together, was such a sight as I never could have seen with so much leisure.

1662-09-07 17:48 Here I also saw Madam Castlemaine, and, which pleased me most, Mr. Crofts, the King’s bastard, a most pretty spark of about 15 years old.

1662-09-07 17:20 I did never see our Queen before; and though she be not very charming, yet she hath a good, modest, and innocent look, which is pleasing.

1662-09-07 17:07 Mr. Pierce the chyrurgeon took me into Somersett House; and into the Queen-Mother’s presence-chamber, where she was with our own Queen.

1662-09-07 15:23 I did no more, though I had so much a mind to it that I spent in my breeches.

1662-09-07 15:22 I went up to Sarah and played and talked with her and, God forgive me, did feel her; which I am much ashamed of.

1662-09-07 14:53 To my Lord’s, where nobody at home but a woman that let me in, and Sarah above.

1662-09-07 11:07 I heard a good sermon of the Dean of Ely’s, upon returning to the old ways, and a most excellent anthem, sung by Captain Cooke.

1662-09-06 17:22 I had my new key and the lock of my office door altered, having lost my key the other day, which vexed me.

1662-09-06 13:42 To Trinity House. We had a couple of venison pasties, of which I eat little, being almost cloyed, having been at five pasties in three days.

1662-09-06 12:03 So up and to my office, and then we met and sat till noon, very full of business.

1662-09-06 06:15 Lay long, that is, till 6 and past before I rose, in order to sweat a little away the cold which I was afraid I might have got yesterday.

1662-09-05 21:07 I this day heard that Mr. Martin Noell is knighted by the King, which I much wonder at; but yet he is certainly a very useful man.

1662-09-05 16:30 It pleased me to see how jealous Sir Williams both are of my going down to Woolwich, and doing my duty, and my dining with the Commission.

1662-09-05 10:20 I walked to Greenwich, and thence by water to Deptford, and examined some stores and did some of my own business in hastening my work there.

1662-09-05 06:35 Before the yacht got to Woolwich the Dutch beat them half-a-mile; which all our people are glad of.

1662-09-05 06:10 I saw the yacht lately built by our virtuosoes set out from Greenwich with the little Dutch bezan, to try for mastery.

1662-09-04 14:32 In 88, Queen Elisabeth had but 36 sail in the world; and ten rounds of powder was their allowance at that time against the Spaniard.

1662-09-04 14:28 Sir Wm. Compton I heard talk with great pleasure of the difference between the fleet now and in Queen Elisabeth’s days.

1662-09-04 13:39 We to the Trinity House, where we treated, very dearly, the officers of the Ordnance; where was Sir W. Compton and the rest.

1662-09-04 06:44 By water betimes to the Tower and so home, where I shifted myself, being to dine abroad, and so being also trimmed.

1662-09-03 16:32 To the office. We met and sold the Weymouth, Successe, and Fellowship hulkes, where pleasant to see how backward men are at first to bid.

1662-09-03 15:02 The Fanatiques and the Presbyters, that did intend to rise, did choose this day as the most auspicious in their endeavours against monarchy.

1662-09-03 09:10 It is the first pay that Mr. Coventry has been at, and I would be thought to be as much with Mr. Coventry as I can.

1662-09-03 08:42 I went over to Redriffe, and walked to Deptford, where I found Mr. Coventry and Sir W. Pen beginning the pay.

1662-09-03 05:22 Whereas I used to rise by four o’clock, it is not broad daylight now till after five o’clock, so that it is after five before I do rise.

1662-09-02 06:10 Up betimes and got myself ready alone, and so to my office, my mind much troubled for my key that I lost yesterday.

1662-09-01 18:42 My wife writes me from the country that her boy plays the rogue there, and she is weary of him, and complains also of her maid Sarah.

1662-09-01 16:12 It being a thing I hate in others, to be careless of keys, I thinking another not fit to be trusted that leaves a key behind their hole.

1662-09-01 16:08 To my office, but missing my key, which I had in my hand just now, makes me very angry and out of order.

1662-09-01 14:18 I removed all my goods out of Sir W. Pen’s house into one room at my house, and so I am to be quit of any further obligation to him.

1662-09-01 11:38 We played over some things of Locke’s that we used to play at sea, that pleased us well, being the first music I have heard a great while.

1662-09-01 09:28 We found the Duke going out by coach with his Duchess, and he told us he was to go abroad with the Queen to-day.

1662-09-01 08:30 With Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen by coach to St. James’s, this being the first day of our meeting there by the Duke’s order.
