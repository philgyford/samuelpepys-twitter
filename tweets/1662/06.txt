1662-06-30 21:48 This I take to be as bad a juncture as ever I observed.

1662-06-30 19:30 To Greenwich Park; and with much ado my Lady Carteret was able to walk up to the top of the hill, and so down again, and took boat.

1662-06-30 17:42 To my house, where I took pride to lead my Lady Carteret through the Court by the hand, she being very fine, her page carrying up her train.

1662-06-30 16:31 Told my Lady Carteret how my Lady Fanshaw is fallen out with her only for speaking in behalf of the French, which my Lady wonders at.

1662-06-30 07:22 I fell upon boring holes for me to see from my closet into the great office, without going forth, wherein I please myself much.

1662-06-30 04:48 To my office, where I found Griffen’s girl making it clean, but, God forgive me! what a mind I had to her, but did not meddle with her.

1662-06-29 20:48 I shall never be deceived again by Sir W. Pen, but do hate him and his traitorous tricks with all my heart.

1662-06-29 11:27 To church with my wife, who put on her green petticoat of flowred satin with white and gimp lace of her own putting on, which is pretty.

1662-06-29 05:42 I do find upon my monthly ballance, which I have undertaken to keep, that I am worth 650l, the greatest sum that ever I was yet master of.

1662-06-28 21:54 I find it to be the effect of my oaths against wine and plays, which, if God please, I will keep constant in, for my business is a delight.

1662-06-28 21:52 My mind is now in a wonderful condition of quiet and content, more than ever in all my life, since my minding the business of my office.

1662-06-28 16:14 Though, God knows! the King is not able to set out five ships without great difficulty, we neither having money, credit, nor stores.

1662-06-28 16:10 Great talk there is of a fear of a war with the Dutch; and we have order to pitch upon twenty ships to be forthwith set out.

1662-06-28 10:82 A genteel woman came, claiming kindred of me, as she had done before, and borrowed 10s, promising to repay it, but I hear nothing of her.

1662-06-27 21:31 Mr. Holliard cured my wife of her pain in her ear by taking out a prodigious quantity of hard wax that had hardened itself in the bottom.

1662-06-27 15:19 Sir J. Minnes tells us they have acquitted Captain Hall, who was accused of cowardice in letting the Argier pyrate go away from him.

1662-06-27 07:48 My Lord’s design is, first, to get clear of all debts to the King for the Embassy money, and then a pardon. Then, to get his land settled.

1662-06-26 13:30 Took Commissioner Pett home to dinner. My stomach was turned when my sturgeon came to table, upon which I saw many little worms creeping.

1662-06-26 05:21 Up and took physique, but such as to go abroad with, only to loosen me, for I am bound.

1662-06-25 21:37 My wife having lately a pain in her ear, for which she begins to take physique, and I have got cold and so have a great deal of my old pain.

1662-06-25 10:02 I into Thames Street, and enquired among the shops the price of tarre and oyle, and do find content in it, and hope to save the King money.

1662-06-24 22:12 Mr. Spong came to me, and so he and I sat singing upon the leads and so he went away (a pretty, harmless, and ingenious man), and I to bed.

1662-06-24 20:31 Field the rogue hath this day cast me at Guildhall in 30l. for his imprisonment, that he hath begun the law with me; and threatens more.

1662-06-24 12:33 Sat all the morning, and I bless God I find that by my diligence of late and still, I do get ground in the office every day.

1662-06-23 18:29 Sir W. Warren showed me the difference between Dram, Swinsound, Christiania, and told me notions concerning their manner of cutting.

1662-06-23 06:38 My people are taking down the hangings in my house because of the great dust that is made by the pulling down of Sir W. Batten’s house.

1662-06-22 18:21 Will. Swan told me that certainly Sir H. Vane must be gone to Heaven, for he died as much a martyr and saint as ever man did.

1662-06-22 18:03 Will. Swan do talk high for the Fanatiques; and do pity my Lord Sandwich and me that we should be given up to the wickedness of the world.

1662-06-22 17:24 Sir W. Penn and his daughter came out to walk, so we took no notice of them a great while, at last in going home spoke a word or two.

1662-06-22 16:49 My wife and I to walk in the garden, where all our talk was against Sir W. Pen, against whom I have lately had cause to be much prejudiced.

1662-06-22 10:07 A Portugall lady, at Hampton Court, hath dropped a child since the Queen’s coming, but the king would not have them searched whose it is.

1662-06-21 21:32 So to bed, with my arm very weary.

1662-06-21 21:20 It is one of the greatest wonders that ever I met with such a boy as he could be able to suffer half so much as he did to maintain a lie.

1662-06-21 21:13 The boy did confess that above all he did lay the candlestick upon the ground in his chamber, which he had denied this quarter of a year.

1662-06-21 21:08 Not willing to let the boy go away a conqueror, I pulled off his frock, and whipped him till he did confess that he did drink the whey.

1662-06-21 20:57 With my whip did whip the boy till I was not able to stir, and yet I could not make him confess any of the lies that they tax him with.

1662-06-21 18:42 I put on my riding cloth suit, only for Mr. Creed to see how it is, and I think it will do very well.

1662-06-21 12:41 The Lieutenant of the Tower, told me that Sir H. Vane died in a passion; but all confess with so much courage as never man died.

1662-06-20 19:46 My wife and I and Jane over the water to the Halfway-house, a pretty, pleasant walk, but the wind high.

1662-06-20 11:58 To Pope’s Head Ally, and there bought me a pair of tweezers, cost me 14s., the first thing like a bawble I have bought a good while.

1662-06-20 10:11 The merchants have a great fear of a breach with the Spaniard; for they think he will not brook our having Tangier, Dunkirk, and Jamaica.

1662-06-20 07:08 I do perceive that I am very short in my business by not knowing many times the geographical part of my business.

1662-06-20 06:59 I turned to the Forrest of Deane, in Speede’s Mapps, and there Sir John Winter showed me how it lies.

1662-06-20 06:08 To the office, and there drew up the agreement between the King and Sir John Winter about the Forrest of Deane.

1662-06-19 20:35 My head has not been so full of business a great while, and with so much pleasure, for I begin to see the pleasure it gives.

1662-06-19 11:03 We had a great private business before us about contracting for 500 ton of hemp, which we went through, and I am to draw up the conditions.

1662-06-19 05:32 Up by five o’clock, and while my man Will was getting himself ready to come up to me I took and played upon my lute a little.

1662-06-18 21:42 After some merry discourse in the kitchen with my wife and maids as I now-a-days often do, I being well pleased with both my maids, to bed.

1662-06-18 15:54 We promised to come some other time, and Lilly would show me Lady Castlemaine’s, which I could not then see, it being locked up!

1662-06-18 15:48 To Lilly’s, the painter’s, where we saw among other rare things, the Duchess of York, her whole body, sitting in a chair, in white sattin.

1662-06-18 14:08 I to my Lord Crew’s and dined with him; where I hear the courage of Sir H. Vane at his death is talked on every where as a miracle.

1662-06-17 20:30 Home and to bed betimes by daylight.

1662-06-17 14:49 To the office, and at Sir W. Batten’s, where we all met by chance and talked, and they drank wine; but I forebore all their healths.

1662-06-16 15:28 With all the children by water to Greenwich, where I showed them the King’s yacht, the house, and the park, all very pleasant.

1662-06-16 07:49 I did view my cozen Joyce’s tallow, and compared it with the Irish tallow we bought, and found ours much more white, but as soft as it.

1662-06-16 06:15 Finally to Deptford, where I saw in what forwardness the work is for Sir W. Batten’s house and mine, and it is almost ready.

1662-06-16 05:00 We walked over the Tower Hill, but the gate not being open we walked through St. Catharine’s and Ratcliffe before we could get a boat.

1662-06-15 19:53 I forbore to advise my wife till she could certainly tell me how things are with her brother, being loth to meddle too soon with him.

1662-06-15 19:48 My wife told me that her brother was married and had a wife worth 500l and did inquire how he might dispose the money to the best advantage.

1662-06-15 17:32 By and by my wife comes again, and, after a word or two, good friends.

1662-06-15 17:03 Home, and found my wife and Sarah gone to a neighbour church, at which I was not much displeased.

1662-06-15 14:38 To church; but my wife not being dressed as I would have her, I was angry, and she returned home again vexed.

1662-06-14 16:08 We had news that the Spaniard is before Lisbon with thirteen sail; six Dutch, and the rest his own ships; which will be ill for Portugall.

1662-06-14 14:48 My Lord Peterborough is come unexpected from Tangier, to give the King an account of the place, which is in none of the best condition.

1662-06-14 12:14 One asked Sir Henry Vane why he did not pray for the King. He answered, “Nay, you shall see I can pray for the King: I pray God bless him!”

1662-06-14 12:08 Sir Henry Vane changed not his colour or speech to the last, but died justifying himself and the cause he had stood for.

1662-06-14 11:45 Sir Henry Vane prayed, and so fitted himself, and received the blow; but the scaffold was so crowded that we could not see it done.

1662-06-14 11:28 Sir Henry Vane made a long speech, interrupted by the Sheriff; they would have taken his paper out of his hand, but he would not let it go.

1662-06-14 11:07 We all went out to the Tower-hill; and there, over against the scaffold, made on purpose this day, saw Sir Henry Vane brought.

1662-06-13 20:08 My wife and I, and Sarah and the boy, a most pleasant walk to Halfway house, and so home and to bed.

1662-06-13 04:29 More I discern therein than ever I thought was to be found in Cicero; but I perceive that he is as good a writer as ever I read in my life.

1662-06-13 04:25 Up by 4 o’clock in the morning, and read Cicero’s Second Oration against Catiline, which pleased me exceedingly.

1662-06-12 20:31 It being the longest day in the year, I made all my people go to bed by daylight.

1662-06-12 15:02 To the Dolphin, where a good dinner; but what is to myself a wonder; that with ease I past the whole dinner without drinking a drop of wine.

1662-06-12 10:06 It is to plead for my clerks to have their right of giving out all warrants, at which I am not a little pleased.

1662-06-12 10:04 At the office I did get a vote signed by all, concerning my issuing of warrants, which they did not smell the use I intend to make of it.

1662-06-12 06:08 I tried on my riding cloth suit with close knees, the first that ever I had; and I think they will be very convenient.

1662-06-11 18:48 Savill the Paynter came and did varnish over my wife’s picture and mine, and I paid him for my little picture 3l, and so am clear with him.

1662-06-11 15:45 I am vexed with all my heart at Pall for writing to my father so much concerning my mother’s illness (which I believe was not so great).

1662-06-11 15:38 I had a letter from my father that he is got down well, and found my mother pretty well again.

1662-06-11 12:18 Mr. Hater and I writing over my Alphabet fair, in which I took pleasure to rule the lines and to have the capitall words wrote with red ink.

1662-06-10 17:03 I had a mind to have bought the King’s works, new printed in folio, and present it to my Lord; I think it will be best to save the money.

1662-06-10 16:58 I went to my bookseller’s, and paid off all for books to this day, and do not intend to buy any more of any kind a good while.

1662-06-10 11:51 At the office all the morning, much business; and great hopes of bringing things, by Mr Coventry’s means, to a good condition in the office.

1662-06-09 18:19 Greatorex recommended Bond, of our end of the town, to teach me to measure timber, and some other things that I would learn.

1662-06-09 07:09 Making my alphabet of contracts, upon the dispatch of which I am now intent for that I am resolved to enquire into the price of commodities.

1662-06-08 20:49 I did ask Will where he learned that immodest garb. He answered me that it was not immodest, at which I did give him two boxes on the ears.

1662-06-08 20:28 I observe my man Will to walk with his cloak flung over his shoulder, like a Ruffian, which I was vexed at.

1662-06-08 18:08 To my Lady’s, and merry, among other things, with the parrott which my Lord hath brought from the sea, which speaks very well.

1662-06-07 19:03 Were it not that Mr. Coventry had already feathered his nest in selling of places, Sir G. Carteret do like him very well.

1662-06-07 17:29 I am afraid now to bring in any accounts for journeys, and so will others I suppose be, because of Mr. Coventry’s prying into them.

1662-06-07 17:26 My mind in great trouble whether I should go as I intended to Hampton Court to-morrow or no.

1662-06-07 13:59 Sir J. Robinson, Lieutenant of the Tower, says that yesterday Sir H. Vane had a full hearing at the King’s Bench, and is found guilty.

1662-06-07 11:26 To the office, and I find Mr. Coventry is resolved to do much good, and to enquire into all the miscarriages of the office.

1662-06-06 15:58 I hope it is otherwise, the letter being four days old since it was writ.

1662-06-06 15:57 To my brother Tom’s, where we found a letter from Pall that my mother is dangerously ill in fear of death, which troubles my father and me.

1662-06-06 12:07 To the Wardrobe to meet my father, who was well treated by my Lady, who tells me she has thoughts to send her boys to our house at Brampton.

1662-06-06 10:37 The smith did open a chest in my office, and we found a modell of a fine ship, which I long to know whether it be the King’s or Mr Turner’s.

1662-06-05 14:28 I was called from dinner to see some thousands of my Lord’s crusados weighed, and we find that 3,000 come to about 530l. or 40 generally.

1662-06-05 09:03 To the office, and I showed them yesterday’s discovery, and have got Sir R. Ford to be my enemy by it; but I care not, for it is my duty.

1662-06-04 15:09 I to my Lord’s, who I find resolved to buy Brampton Manor of Sir Peter Ball, at which I am glad.

1662-06-04 10:03 I was glad of this discovery, because I would not have the King’s workmen discouraged from representing the faults of merchants’ goods.

1662-06-04 09:48 Some of Sir R. Ford’s yarn had old stuff that had been tarred, covered over with new hemp, which is such a cheat as hath not been heard of.

1662-06-04 09:44 We saw an experiment made of Holland’s yarn. We found it to be bad, and broke sooner than five threads of that against four of Riga yarn.

1662-06-03 22:15 I made the maids to rise and light a candle, and set it in the dining-room, to scare away thieves, and so to sleep.

1662-06-03 21:56 Home and to bed, my mind troubled about Sir W. Pen, his playing the rogue with me, as also about the charge of money that is in my house.

1662-06-03 17:39 Yesterday the Aldermen of the City did attend the Queen in their habits, and did present her with a gold Cupp and 1000l. in gold therein.

1662-06-03 16:41 I found my Lady come from Hampton Court, where the Queen hath used her civilly; my Lady tells me is a most pretty woman, at which I am glad.

1662-06-03 13:49 Mr. Creed and Shepley were ready with three chests of the crusados, being about 6000l, to bring to my house, which they put it in my cellar.

1662-06-03 09:54 It was ruled for me. Sir W. Pen did it like a base raskall, and so I shall remember him while I live.

1662-06-03 09:32 Upon our making a contract, I went to draw the heads thereof, but Sir W. Pen most basely told me that the Comptroller is to do it.

1662-06-03 04:51 To my business in my chamber, to even accounts, and very fain I would become master of 1000l, but I have not above 530l. toward it yet.

1662-06-02 20:12 This day my wife put on her slasht wastecoate, which is very pretty.

1662-06-02 14:49 We found Mrs. Clarke in a dishabille, intending to go to Hampton Court to-morrow. We had much pretty discourse, and a very fine lady she is.

1662-06-02 14:33 My wife and I to Mrs. Clarke’s at Westminster, the first visit that ever we both made her yet.

1662-06-02 08:28 To the Wardrobe with Mr. Moore, and spoke to my Lord about the exchange of the crusados into sterling money, and other matters.

1662-06-01 15:22 To church, where a Presbyter made a sad and long sermon, which vexed me.
