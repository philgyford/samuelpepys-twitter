1662-08-31 19:43   Some Presbyters were clapped up to-day, and strict watch is kept in the City by the train-bands, and letters of a plot are taken.

1662-08-31 15:34   The best of his sermon was the degrees of walking, standing, and sitting, showing how by steps and degrees sinners do grow in wickedness.

1662-08-31 15:32   To church, and heard a simple sermon of a stranger upon David’s words, “Blessed is the man that walketh not in the way of the ungodly,” &c.

1662-08-31 14:19   My wife is still in the country; my house all in dirt; but my work in a good forwardness, and will be much to my mind at last.

1662-08-31 14:07   To my office, and there made my monthly accounts, and find myself worth in money about 686l. 19s. 2½d., for which God be praised.

1662-08-31 07:16   Waked early, but being in a strange house, did not rise till 7 o’clock almost, and so rose and read over my oaths.

1662-08-30 12:12   It troubled me exceedingly what to do for a lodging, and more what to do with my goods, that are all in Sir W. Pen’s house.

1662-08-30 12:10   I had news that Sir W. Pen would be in town from Ireland, which I much wonder at, he giving so little notice of it.

1662-08-29 19:56   I did begin with Mr. Lewes to look into the nature of a purser’s account, and the business of victualling, in which there is great variety.

1662-08-29 14:07   To my workmen again, finding my presence to carry on the work both to my mind and with more haste, and I thank God I am pleased with it.

1662-08-28 07:31   I rose and among my workmen, in my gown, without a doublet, till I was afraid of getting an ague.

1662-08-28 05:58   Will, whom I used to call two or three times in a morning, would now wake and rise without calling. Which though angry I was glad to see.

1662-08-28 00:14   Having discharged my mind, I went to bed.

1662-08-28 00:04   I am resolved to look out some boy that I may have the bringing up of after my own mind.

1662-08-27 23:58   I struck Will, and did stay up chiding him for it, and did in plain terms tell him that I would not be served so.

1662-08-27 23:44   When I came home I found Will there at his ease in his study, which vexed me cruelly, that he should let me be all alone waiting for him.

1662-08-27 23:42   I did not think Will was come home, but was in fear for him, it being very late, what was become of him.

1662-08-27 17:34   To-day my hogshead of sherry I have sold to Sir W. Batten, and am glad of my money instead of wine.

1662-08-26 23:21   So to bed.

1662-08-26 22:03   To Deptford and to the payhouse, and there paying off the Martin and Kinsale, being small but troublesome ships to pay.

1662-08-26 12:49   Dined alone with Sir W. Batten, which I have not done a great while, but his lady being out of the way I was the willinger to do it.

1662-08-26 05:21   Up betimes and among my workmen, with great pleasure seeing them go on merrily, and a good many hands, which I perceive makes good riddance.

1662-08-25 21:33   To my office ordering of several businesses, and so home and to bed, my mind, God be praised, full of business, but great quiet.

1662-08-25 09:42   By water to Woolwich where I staid seeing a cable of 14 inches laid, in which there was good variety.

1662-08-25 08:10   In Hamcreek, where I have never been before, and there found two of the King’s ships without any living creature aboard, which troubled me.

1662-08-24 20:48   There hath been a disturbance in a church; a great many young people knotting together and crying out “Porridge” seditiously in the church.

1662-08-24 08:54   Will Griffin and Thomas Hewett got into the pew next to our backs, where our maids sit; so forward some people are to outrun themselves.

1662-08-24 08:46   I rose and to my office till church time, writing down my yesterday’s observations, and so to church, where I all alone.

1662-08-24 07:07   I slept till 7 o’clock, which I have not done a very great while, but it was my weariness last night that caused it.

1662-08-23 21:10   The streets being crammed with people going home to the City, for all the borders of the river had been full of people as the King had come.

1662-08-23 18:35   My Lord and I had private discourse about the discontents of the times; but we do not think religion will so soon cause another war.

1662-08-23 16:21   That which pleased me best was, that my Lady Castlemaine stood over upon a piece of White Hall, where I glutted myself with looking on her.

1662-08-23 15:50   Anon come the King and Queen in a barge under a canopy with 10,000 barges and boats, I think, for we could see no water for them.

1662-08-23 15:15   To White Hall, and through my Lord’s lodgings we got into the garden, and to the Bowling-green, and to the top of the new Banqueting House.

1662-08-23 14:25   I offered eight shillings for a boat to attend me, and they would not, it being the day of the Queen’s coming to town from Hampton Court.

1662-08-23 12:22   Mr. Coventry did tell me his mind about Sir G. Carteret’s having so much the command of the money. And it is the bane of all our business.

1662-08-22 17:28   I had liked to have begged a parrot for my wife, but Mr. Creed hath put me in a way to get a better from Steventon; at Portsmouth.

1662-08-22 17:15   Mr. Creed and I walked together, and then to his lodgings at Clerke’s, the confectioner’s, where he did give me a little banquet.

1662-08-22 16:22   To Westminster Hall and there I met with Will Bowyer, and had a promise from him of a place to stand to-morrow at his house to see the show.

1662-08-22 13:40   I sent for some of my workmen and did scold at them so as I hope my work will be hastened.

1662-08-22 10:28   While Captain Badily was talking to us one from a trap-door above let fall a coyle of cable; it was 10,000 to one it had not broke his neck.

1662-08-22 10:07   Up to my office, and went down to Deptford, and there with Mr. Davis did look over most of his stores.

1662-08-22 03:52   The catt was lockt in the chamber, and kept a great mewing, and leapt upon the bed, which made me I could not sleep a great while.

1662-08-22 03:07   I waked with the noise of the rayne, having never in my life heard a more violent shower.

1662-08-21 13:51   How easily was I stirred to desire my aunt and this pretty lady (for it was for her that I did it) to carry them to see the pleasure boats.

1662-08-20 13:11   We had a venison pasty, and other good handsome dishes; the mistress of the house a pretty, well-carriaged woman, and a fine hand she hath.

1662-08-20 08:04   On all hands, by God’s blessing, I find myself a very rising man.

1662-08-20 07:41   Mr. Coventry did tell my Lord that I was indeed the life of this office, and much more to my commendation beyond measure.

1662-08-20 06:55   My Lord Sandwich do tell me that he hath put me into commission in the business of Tangier, which is a very great honour to me.

1662-08-19 07:41   Mr. Creed tells me that my Lord has put me into Commission for Tangier, which, if it be, is not only great honour, but may be of profit too.

1662-08-18 16:59   Deane and I home again, and parted at Bowe, and I home just before a great showre of rayne, as God would have it.

1662-08-18 14:44   I got a horseback again and rode to Barking, and there saw the place where they ship this timber for Woolwich.

1662-08-18 12:20   We rode to Illford, and Mr. Deane and I practised measuring of the tables and other things till I did understand measuring of timber well.

1662-08-18 10:30   Mr. Deane showed me the mystery of off square, wherein the King is abused in the timber that he buys, which I shall be able to correct.

1662-08-18 10:12   Mr. Deane and I rid into Waltham Forest, and there we saw many trees of the King’s a-hewing.

1662-08-18 09:00   Took horse and rode to Bowe, and there staid at the King’s Head, and eat a breakfast of eggs till Mr. Deane of Woolwich came to me.

1662-08-17 21:15   I hear most of the Presbyters took their leaves to-day, and that the City is much dissatisfied with it. I pray God keep peace among us.

1662-08-17 14:29   “This is just the case of England at present. God he bids us to preach, and men bid us not to preach; and if we do we are to be imprisoned.”

1662-08-17 12:07   Parson Herring, by reading so much of the Common Prayer as he did, hath cast himself out of the good opinion of both sides.

1662-08-17 09:22   Dr. Bates’s text was, “Now the God of Peace;” the last Hebrews, and the 20th verse: a good sermon and little reflections in it to the times.

1662-08-17 07:59   I walked in the Temple-garden, reading my vows. It is a great content to me to see how I am a changed man for the better, since I took them.

1662-08-17 06:54   I walked to St. Dunstan’s, where, it not being seven o’clock yet, the doors were not open.

1662-08-17 03:58   Up early, this being the last Sunday that the Presbyterians are to preach, unless they read the new Common Prayer and renounce the Covenant.

1662-08-16 04:51   Looking over my work; and am pleased, but it will be long before they have done, though the house is cover’d and I free from the weather.

1662-08-15 19:01   I hear that next Sunday will be the last of a great many Presbyterian ministers in town, who, I hear, will give up all.

1662-08-15 14:20   After dinner comes in a jugler, which shewed us very pretty tricks.

1662-08-15 13:44   To the Swan, where Mr. Brigden and Blackbury, of whom we had bought timber, but have not dealt well with us, did make me a fine dinner.

1662-08-15 12:32   To the Change, and there hear of some Quakers that are seized on, that would have blown up the prison in Southwark where they are put.

1662-08-15 04:12   Up about seeing how my work proceeds, and am pretty well pleased therewith; especially my wife’s closet will be very pretty.

1662-08-14 13:08   Commissioner Pett and I went to the Mitre in Fenchurch street, to a venison-pasty; I found Sir John Winter a worthy man; and good discourse.

1662-08-14 04:27   Up early and to look on my works, and find my house to go on apace.

1662-08-13 15:08   To Lambeth; and there saw the little pleasure-boat in building by the King, according to new lines, which Mr. Pett cries up mightily.

1662-08-13 08:49   I find it the greatest cheat; the flag-makers having eightpence per yard allowed them by pretence of a contract where no such thing appears.

1662-08-13 07:52   We met to enquire into the business of the flag-makers, where I am the person that do manage the business against them on the King’s part.

1662-08-12 08:44   Mr. Deane, the Assistant of Woolwich, promises me a modell of a ship, which will please me exceedingly, for I do want one of my own.

1662-08-11 21:42   To my business, and so to supper and to bed, my mind a little at ease because my house is now quite tiled.

1662-08-11 18:07   Cooper read his last lecture to me upon my modell, and bid me good bye, he being to go to Chatham to take charge of the ship I have got him.

1662-08-11 15:29   Dean Fuller tells me his niece, that sings so well, whom I have longed to see, is married to Mr. Boys, a wholesale man at the Three Crowns.

1662-08-10 12:10   My uncle Fenner told me the new service-book was laid upon their deske at St. Sepulchre’s for Mr. Gouge; but he would not meddle with it.

1662-08-10 11:04   I heard Dr. Bates; and I am sorry I have hitherto had so low an opinion of the man, for I have not heard a neater sermon a great while.

1662-08-09 20:42   Writing a letter to my brother John to dissuade him from being Moderator of his year, which I hear is proffered him, of which I am glad.

1662-08-09 10:57   Comes Cooper, and fell to work upon our modell, and did a good morning’s work upon the rigging, and am sorry that I must lose him so soon.

1662-08-08 18:09   To Deptford, and called them to a muster, and discovered many abuses, which we shall be able to understand hereafter and amend.

1662-08-08 16:52   A man that cannot say no is not fit for business. Which is a very great fault of mine, which I must amend in.

1662-08-08 16:41   Mr. Falconer’s rule of suspecting every man that proposes any thing to him to be a knave; or, at least, to have some ends of his own in it.

1662-08-08 14:48   After dinner to several experiments of Hemp, and particularly some Milan hemp that is brought over ready dressed.

1662-08-08 12:30   By water to Woolwich, there to see the manner of tarring, and all the morning looking to see the several proceedings in making of cordage.

1662-08-07 22:14   It being become a pleasure to me to follow my business, and the greatest part may be imputed to my drinking no wine, and going to no plays.

1662-08-07 12:10   We sat in the office and staid all the morning, my interest still growing, for which God be praised.

1662-08-07 05:58   Up by four o’clock and to my office, and by and by Mr. Cooper comes and to our modell, which pleases me more and more.

1662-08-06 21:35   Writing in my study a mouse ran over my table, which I shut up fast under my shelf’s upon my table till to-morrow, and so home and to bed.

1662-08-06 16:33   I see Sir W. Batten perceives himself tottering, and that he is suspected, and would be kind to me, but I do my business and neglect him.

1662-08-06 12:49   Dined at home, and can hardly keep myself from having a mind to my wench, but I hope I shall not fall to such a shame to myself.

1662-08-06 10:00   The world says Mr. Montagu did carry himself poorly in the business, and hath lost his honour with all people in it, of which I am glad.

1662-08-06 09:58   Mr. Cholmely drove Montagu so far backward that he fell into a ditch, and dropt his sword, but with honour would take no advantage over him.

1662-08-06 09:56   Mr. Pierce, the chyrurgeon, told me how Mr. Edward Montagu hath had a duell with Mr. Cholmely, that is first gentleman-usher to the Queen.

1662-08-06 05:26   Walked a good while talking with Sir G. Carteret about Sir W. Batten, and find that he is going down the wind in every body’s esteem.

1662-08-05 21:58   To the office again all the afternoon till it was so dark that I could not see hardly what it is that I now set down when I write this word.

1662-08-05 12:52   Dined alone at home, and was glad my house is begun tiling.

1662-08-05 03:13   So to the Towerdock and home, where the girl sat up for me. It was about three o’clock, and putting Mr. Boddam out of my bed, went to bed.

1662-08-05 01:20   At Greenwich set in, Captain Cocke and I set forward, hailing to all the King’s ships at Deptford, but could not wake any man.

1662-08-04 23:58   Above Woolwich we lost our way, and went back to Blackwall, and up and down, being guided by nothing but the barking of a dog.

1662-08-04 23:36   We went on, but I in such fear that I could not sleep till we came to Erith, and there it begun to be calm, and the stars to shine.

1662-08-04 22:47   The wind rising, and our waterman unacquainted with this part of the river, we presently cast upon the Essex shore, but got off again.

1662-08-04 21:52   To Rochester, and there Captain Cocke and I and our two men took coach and to Gravesend, where it was very dark before we got thither.

1662-08-04 11:38   To the yard, and mustered the whole ordinary, where great disorder by multitude of servants and old decrepid men, which must be remedied.

1662-08-04 09:53   To Upnor Castle, and there went up to the top, where there is a fine prospect, but of very small force.

1662-08-04 07:07   To the Charles, and were troubled to see her kept so neglectedly by the boatswain Clements, who I always took for a very good officer.

1662-08-04 05:32   Walked to the Dock, where Commissioner Pett and I took barge and went to the guardships and mustered them, finding them but badly manned.

1662-08-03 21:49   Among other stories Captain Cocke told me how despicable a thing it is to be a hangman in Poland, although it be a place of credit.

1662-08-03 18:38   To the Commissioner’s house, and saw his closet, which come short of what I expected, but there was fine modells of ships in it indeed.

1662-08-03 13:21   The Commissioner staid at dinner with me, and we had a good dinner, better than I would have had, but I saw there was no helping of it.

1662-08-03 08:10   Commissioner Pett did give us bread and butter, and sweetmeats, and strong drinks, with which I could not avoyde making my head ake.

1662-08-02 23:50   To the Hill-house, where we soon went to bed, I telling Captain Cocke the manner of my being cut of the stone, which pleased him much.

1662-08-02 22:37   Finding Mr. Hemson and Lieutenant Carteret come to meet me, I borrowed Mr. Hemson’s horse, and he took another, and so we rode to Rochester.

1662-08-02 21:11   We had a pleasant passage down to Gravesend, but it was nine o’clock before we got thither, so that we were in great doubt what to do.

1662-08-02 12:55   I eat among other fruit much mulberrys, a thing I have not eat of these many years, since I used to be at Ashted, at my cozen Pepys’s.

1662-08-02 12:01   I to Captain Cocke’s along with him to dinner, where I find his lady still pretty, but not so good a humour as I thought she was.

1662-08-02 11:22   I took boat down to Greenwich, where Captain Cocke not being at home I was vexed, and went to walk in the Park till he come thither to me.

1662-08-01 21:15   And so to bed, being in pain in my cods with the little riding in a coach to-day from the Exchange, which do trouble me.

1662-08-01 19:12   I had also a mind to my own wench, but I dare not for fear she should prove honest and refuse and then tell my wife.

1662-08-01 19:09   I was sorry to hear that Sir W. Pen’s maid Betty was gone away yesterday for I was in hopes to have had a bout with her before she had gone.

1662-08-01 12:37   At noon to the Exchange, where meeting Mr. Creed and Moore we three to a house hard by (which I was not pleased with) to dinner.

1662-08-01 08:30   Up, my head aching, and to my office, where Cooper read me another lecture upon my modell very pleasant.
