1662-02-28 20:21 The rods were so small that I fear they did not much hurt to the boy, but only to my arm, which I am already not able to stir almost.

1662-02-28 20:07 To be as good as my word, I bade Will get me a rod, and he and I called the boy, and I reckoned all his faults, and whipped him soundly.

1662-02-28 16:33 Mr. Hater received half a year’s salary for me, so that now there is nothing owing me but this quarter, which will be out the next month.

1662-02-28 09:01 To the Duke of York, and I presented him from my Lord a fine map of Tangier, done by one Captain Beckman, a Swede, that is with my Lord.

1662-02-28 07:09 The boy failing to call us up as I commanded, I was angry, and resolved to whip him for that and many other faults, to-day.

1662-02-27 10:22 In a pet Mr. Berkenshaw flung out of my chamber and I never stopped him. I think I have all the rules that he hath to give.

1662-02-27 10:07 Mr Berkenshaw cries up his rules for perfect. I could not persuade him to grant wherein they were somewhat lame, and we fell to angry words.

1662-02-26 15:29 To my Bookseller’s, and several other places to pay my debts, I being resolved to cast up my accounts, for I fear I have run out too far.

1662-02-26 12:07 Mr. Berkenshaw with me all the morning composing of musique to “This cursed jealousy, what is it,” a song of Sir W. Davenant’s.

1662-02-25 12:59 We have letters from the forest of Deane, that above 1000 Oakes and as many beeches are blown down in one walk there.

1662-02-25 12:30 With Mr. Moore to the Coffee-house, where among other things the great talk was of the effects of this late great wind.

1662-02-24 20:17 Called Will up, and chid him for refusing to go to church with the maids, and telling his mistress that he would not be made a slave of.

1662-02-24 16:47 To Mr. Berkenshaw’s, and there sat with him, he showing me his great card of the body of musique, which he cries up for a rare thing.

1662-02-24 11:38 I did give Mr. Berkenshaw 5l. for this month that he hath taught me, which is a great deal of money and troubled me to part with it.

1662-02-24 11:28 Long with Mr. Berkenshaw in the morning at my musique practice; finishing my song of “Gaze not on Swans,” which pleases me well.

1662-02-23 21:34 If I have a heart to be contented, I think I may reckon myself as happy a man as any is in the world, for which God be praised.

1662-02-23 21:29 This day by God’s mercy I am 29 years of age, and in very good health, and like to live and get an estate.

1662-02-23 17:07 My cold being increased I staid at home, pleasing myself with my dining-room, now graced with pictures, reading of Dr. Fuller’s “Worthys.”

1662-02-22 20:23 I am much troubled for it, and for the grief and disgrace it brings to their family and friends.

1662-02-22 20:21 My Lord of Dorset’s two oldest sons were lately apprehended for killing and robbing of a tanner about Newington, and are now in Newgate.

1662-02-22 16:38 Home, and thither came Mr Savill with the pictures and we hung them up in our dining-room. It comes to appear handsome with all my pictures.

1662-02-22 14:29 To our Attorney, Wellpoole’s, and there found that Godfry has basely taken out a judgment against us for the 40l, for which I am vexed.

1662-02-21 11:42 All the morning putting things in my house in order, and packing up glass to send to my father, and books to my brother John.

1662-02-20 16:32 To the Wardrobe, and could not stay dinner, but went to Mr. Savill’s, and sat the first time for my picture in little, which pleaseth me.

1662-02-20 10:02 Come letters from Tangier from my Lord, telling me how he had put in 300 men into the town and so he is in possession, of which we are glad.

1662-02-19 11:48 To the Trinity House to conclude upon our report of Sir N. Crisp’s project, who came to us to answer objections, but we did give him no ear.

1662-02-18 17:32 Saw “The Law against Lovers” a good play and well performed, especially the little girl’s (whom I never saw act before) dancing and singing.

1662-02-18 15:28 One Lady Sanderson, a person of quality in Covent Garden, was killed by the fall of the house, in her bed, last night.

1662-02-18 15:10 Several persons had been killed to-day by the fall of things in the streets, and that the pageant in Fleetstreet is most of it blown down.

1662-02-18 15:00 The streets were every where full of brick-battes and tyles flung down by the extraordinary wind the last night.

1662-02-17 18:15 We played at gleeke, and I won 9s. 6d. clear, the most that ever I won in my life. I pray God it may not tempt me to play again.

1662-02-17 13:42 I drank wine upon necessity, being ill for want of it. I fear that by my too sudden leaving off wine, I do contract many evils upon myself.

1662-02-17 13:21 The Sir Williams being unwilling to eat flesh, Captain Cocke and I had a breast of veal roasted.

1662-02-16 17:08 Dr Jacomb told us that he heard more of the Common Prayer this afternoon (while he stood in the vestry) than he had heard this twenty years.

1662-02-16 15:22 To hear Dr. Jacomb preach upon the recovery. He preached upon David’s words, “I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord.”

1662-02-15 19:32 Talking of Mr. Waith, at whose child’s christening we should have been, but none of them went and I am glad of it, for he is a very rogue.

1662-02-15 14:09 I was sworn a Younger Brother; Sir W. Rider being Deputy Master; and after I was sworn, all the Elder Brothers shake me by the hand.

1662-02-15 11:21 With the two Sir Williams to the Trinity-house; and there had the business debated of Sir Nicholas Crisp’s sasse at Deptford.

1662-02-14 16:48 I did purposely shun to be seen at Sir W. Batten’s. I would not have his daughter to be my Valentine, there being no friendship between us.

1662-02-14 11:52 W. Bowyer was my wife’s Valentine, she having held her hands all the morning, that she might not see the paynters at work in my diningroom.

1662-02-13 20:12 Last night died the Queen of Bohemia.

1662-02-13 14:52 Mr. Kennard and I and Sir W. Pen went up and down his house to view what may be the contrivance and alterations there to the best advantage.

1662-02-13 11:41 Tom Pepys did stay with me discoursing about the difference between my uncle Thomas and me, and what way there may be to make it up.

1662-02-12 16:05 And so home to dinner with my mind very highly contented with my day’s work, wishing I could do so every day.

1662-02-12 15:57 I abroad, doing of many and considerable businesses at Mr. Phillips the lawyer, with Prior, Westminster, my Lord Crew’s, Wardrobe, &c.

1662-02-11 22:43 At night begun to compose songs, and begin with “Gaze not on Swans.” So to bed.

1662-02-11 10:07 Spoke to Tom about selling of Sturtlow, and I think will be the best for him, considering that he needs money, and has no mind to marry.

1662-02-10 14:54 Troubled that (though Dr. Fuller had some discourse with me) he says nothing at all, nor mentions us either in Cambridgeshire or Norfolk.

1662-02-10 14:07 I met with Dr. Fuller’s “England’s Worthys,”; I sat down reading in it, till it was two o’clock before I thought of the time going.

1662-02-09 18:08 I took physique, and was all day in my chamber, talking with my wife about her laying out of 20l, and composing some ayres, God forgive me!

1662-02-08 21:48 Being a little chillish, intending to take physique to-morrow morning.

1662-02-08 18:53 Sir W. Pen telling me of the ill management of our office, and how Wood the timber merchant and others were very knaves.

1662-02-08 12:42 Now the cellar is done and made clean, it do please me exceedingly, as much as any thing that was ever yet done to my house.

1662-02-08 12:21 All the morning in the cellar with the colliers, removing the coles out of the old cole hole into the new one, which cost me 8s. the doing.

1662-02-07 22:00 Not that I fear him at all, but the natural aptness I have to be troubled at any thing that crosses me.

1662-02-07 21:58 Hearing that Mr. Turner was much troubled at what I do in the office, and do give ill words to Sir W. Pen of me, I am much troubled.

1662-02-07 16:09 I found the joyners putting up my chimney-piece, only the frame for a picture they have made so massy that I cannot tell what to do with it.

1662-02-07 13:07 To the Wardrobe to dinner with my Lady; where a civitt cat, parrot, apes, and many other things are come from my Lord by Captain Hill.

1662-02-07 09:47 To Westminster with Commissioner Pett where I hear the prisoners in the Tower that are to die are come to the Parliament-house this morning.

1662-02-06 22:17 My swelling I think do begin to go away again.

1662-02-06 14:46 And so to the office, where I do begin to be exact in my duty there and exacting my privileges, and shall continue to do so.

1662-02-06 12:22 Comes my uncle Thomas, to ask for his annuity and I did tell him my mind freely. We had high words, but I was willing to end all in peace.

1662-02-06 10:30 At my musique practice, and so into my cellar to my workmen, and I am very much pleased with my alteracon there.

1662-02-05 22:42 Supped with Sir W. Pen and played at cards, and so home and to bed, putting some cataplasm to my testicle which begins to swell again.

1662-02-05 15:28 So to the House again. I did look long upon my Lady Castlemaine, who, notwithstanding her late sickness, continues a great beauty.

1662-02-05 13:32 Sir W. Pen and I and my wife to the Theatre, but being very early we went out again to the next door, and drank some Rhenish wine and sugar.

1662-02-04 16:38 One met me and did serve a subpoena upon me for one Field, whom we did commit to prison for some ill words he did give the office.

1662-02-04 12:49 Of the tarantula, Mr Templer says that all harvest long fidlers go up and down fields in expectation of being hired by those that are stung.

1662-02-04 12:12 When the lark is soared to the highest the serpents do place themselves with their mouths uppermost and they do eject poyson up to the bird.

1662-02-04 12:10 Mr. Templer, discoursing of serpents, told us some that in the waste places of Lancashire do grow to a bigness, and that do feed upon larks.

1662-02-03 22:29 Being in my chamber, we do hear great noise of mirth at Sir William Batten’s, tearing the ribbands from my Lady and him.

1662-02-03 21:04 To Major Holmes’s, and there we had a fine supper, among others, excellent lobsters, which I never eat at this time of the year before.

1662-02-03 13:58 Mrs. Shippman did fill the pye full of wine, a pint and a half, and did drink it off, the greatest draft that ever I did see a woman drink.

1662-02-03 13:36 They had three pyes, whereof the middlemost was made of an ovall form, in an ovall hole within the other two, which made much mirth.

1662-02-03 13:22 I dined with Sir W. Batten with many friends, it being his wedding-day.

1662-02-02 15:08 My wife and I to church, where we had an Oxford man give us a most impertinent sermon upon “Cast your bread upon the waters,” &c.

1662-02-01 22:44 I home, and late writing letters to my father and Dr. Fairebrother, and an angry letter to my brother John for not writing to me.

1662-02-01 13:48 Express is come from my Lord with letters, that by a great tempest the mole of Argier is broken, and many of their ships sunk into the mole.

1662-02-01 12:15 With Mr. Pett to the Paynter’s; and he likes our pictures very well, and so do I.

1662-02-01 11:32 I and Sir W. Pen talking of putting his son to Cambridge; I intend to write to Dr Fairebrother to give an account of Mr Burton of Magdalene.
