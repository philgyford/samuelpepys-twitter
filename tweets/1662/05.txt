1662-05-31 22:22   The King is pleased enough with the Queen which, I fear, will put Madam Castlemaine’s nose out of joynt.

1662-05-31 22:18   The Queen is brought a few days since to Hampton Court; and all people say of her to be a very fine and handsome lady, and very discreet.

1662-05-31 21:58   My health pretty well, but only wind do now and then torment me about the fundament extremely.

1662-05-31 20:22   I did in a suddaine fit cut off all my beard, which I had been a great while bringing up, that I may with my pumice-stone do my whole face.

1662-05-31 20:07   Had Sarah comb my head clean, which I found so foul with powdering and other troubles that I am resolved to keep my head dry without powder.

1662-05-30 22:59   Mr. Shepley came to sup with me. So we had a dish of mackerell and pease, and so he bid us good night, going to lie on board the hoy.

1662-05-30 13:59   Many birds and other pretty noveltys there was, but I was afeard of being louzy, and so took boat again.

1662-05-30 13:46   We saw a little Turk and a negroe, which are intended for pages to the two young ladies.

1662-05-30 12:09   Meeting Mr. Shepley in a hoy, bringing up my Lord’s things, my wife and I went on board, and sailed up with them as far as half-way tree.

1662-05-30 11:22   I took my wife, Sarah and Will by water, with some victuals, as low as Gravesend, intending to have gone into the Hope to the Royal James.

1662-05-30 09:21   I find myself ‘de claro’ worth 530l, so little have I increased it since my last reckoning; I confess I have laid out much money in clothes.

1662-05-29 22:09   This day, being the King’s birth-day, was very solemnly observed; and the more, for that the Queen this day comes to Hampton Court.

1662-05-29 20:03   After a long walk, passed out of doors as we did in the other place, here we had cakes and powdered beef and ale.

1662-05-29 19:22   To the New Spring Garden, where I never was before, which much exceeds the other; and here we also walked.

1662-05-29 17:57   To the Old Spring Garden, and walked long. Seeing that we could not have anything to eat, but very dear, and with long stay, we went forth.

1662-05-29 16:48   With my wife and the two maids, and the boy, took boat and to Foxhall, where I had not been a great while.

1662-05-29 13:59   They have been under some disorder in fear of a fire at the next door, and had been removing their goods, but the fire was over.

1662-05-29 13:43   In Lumbard Street I was called out of a window by Alderman Backwell, where I went, and saluted his lady, a very pretty woman.

1662-05-28 13:56   Comes my father to dine with me, which we did very merrily, I desiring to make him as merry as I can, while the poor man is in town.

1662-05-27 14:18   My father tells me his alterations of the house and garden at Brampton, which please me well.

1662-05-26 19:54   Homewards by coach, through Moorefields, where we stood awhile, and saw the wrestling.

1662-05-26 18:09   To the Redd Bull, where we saw “Doctor Faustus,” but so wretchedly and poorly done, that we were sick of it.

1662-05-26 15:44   Mr. Prin, in discourse with me, fell upon what records he hath of the lust and wicked lives of the nuns heretofore in England.

1662-05-26 07:08   We found that my Lord is above 7,000l. in debt, and that he hath money coming into him that will clear all, and so we think him clear.

1662-05-26 04:07   Up by four o’clock in the morning, and fell to the preparing of some accounts for my Lord of Sandwich.

1662-05-25 22:08   The King’s guards and some City companies do walk up and down the town; and they do say there are some plots in laying. God keep us.

1662-05-25 17:26   Captn. Ferrers showed me some Portugall ladys, come to town before the Queen. They are not handsome, and their farthingales a strange dress.

1662-05-25 13:29   This day I had the first dish of pease I have had this year.

1662-05-25 11:04   Mr. Woodcocke prayed that God would deliver a woman in childbed from the hereditary curse of child-bearing, a pretty strange expression.

1662-05-25 06:10   To trimming myself with a pumice stone, which I learnt of Mr. Marsh, when I was at Portsmouth; and I find it very easy, speedy, and cleanly.

1662-05-24 13:57   I took Mr. Creed to Fish Street, and there we had a couple of lobsters, and dined upon them, and much discourse.

1662-05-24 11:32   Abroad with Mr. Creed, of whom I informed myself of all I had a mind to know.

1662-05-23 18:49   Here among the fidlers I first saw a dulcimere played on with sticks knocking of the strings, and is very pretty.

1662-05-23 18:43   My wife and I to the puppet play in Covent Garden, which I saw the other day, and indeed it is very pleasant.

1662-05-23 17:28   To the Opera, where we saw “Witt in a Constable,” the first time that it is acted; but so silly a play I never saw I think in my life.

1662-05-23 13:39   So to dinner. My Lord mighty merry; among other things, saying that the Queen is a very agreeable lady, and paints still.

1662-05-23 13:08   I went up waiting my Lord’s coming out of my Lady’s chamber, which by and by he did, and looks very well, and my soul is glad to see him.

1662-05-23 12:32   News was brought me that my Lord Sandwich is come and gone up to my Lady, which put me into great suspense of joy.

1662-05-22 21:17   Captain Teddiman hath also sent each of us some anchovies, olives, and muscatt; but I know not yet what that is, and am ashamed to ask.

1662-05-22 21:06   We had a letter from Captain Teddiman, of a peace made upon good terms, by Sir J. Lawson, with the Argier men, which is most excellent news.

1662-05-22 17:36   To the Theatre and saw “Love in a Maze.” The play hath little in it but Lacy’s part of a country fellow, which he did to admiration.

1662-05-21 19:42   Mrs. Turner’s two boys come out of the country, grown very plain boys after three years being under their father’s care in Yorkshire.

1662-05-21 17:15   “The French Dancing Master” pleased us very well; but Lacy’s part, the Dancing Master, the best in the world.

1662-05-21 16:54   To the Theatre and there with much pleasure gazed upon my Lady Castlemaine; but it troubles us to see her slighted by people already.

1662-05-21 13:10   My Lady Castlemaine is now a most disconsolate creature, and comes not out of doors, since the King’s going.

1662-05-21 09:04   In the Privy-garden saw the finest smocks and linen petticoats of my Lady Castlemaine’s, that ever I saw; and did me good to look upon them.

1662-05-20 21:37   I do think it best to enjoy pleasure now that we have health, money, and opportunity, rather than to leave pleasures to old age or poverty.

1662-05-20 21:23   Home again, and so good night, this being a pleasant life that we now lead, and have long done; the Lord be blessed, and make us thankful.

1662-05-20 20:03   To Tower-wharf, and there took boat, and we all walked to Halfeway House, and there eat and drank, and were pleasant.

1662-05-20 17:48   Saw the 2nd part of “The Siege of Rhodes,” but it is not so well done as when Roxalana was there, who is now owned by my Lord of Oxford.

1662-05-19 22:04   The King was forced to stay till almost nine o’clock at night before he could have done, and then he prorogued the House; and so to Gilford.

1662-05-19 19:12   To Moorefields, and walked and eat some cheesecake and gammon of bacon, but when I was come home I was sick, forced to vomit it up again.

1662-05-19 09:52   The House do think they should be forced to huddle over business this morning, for the King to pass their Acts, that he may go out of town.

1662-05-19 08:55   Long in bed, and at last up, and put on my riding cloth suit, and a camelott coat new, which pleases me well enough.

1662-05-18 23:30   I found my wife discontented at my being abroad, but I pleased her. She was in her new suit of sarcenet and yellow petticoat very pretty.

1662-05-18 22:55   They were reading all the bills over that are to pass to-morrow at the House, before the King’s going out of town and proroguing the House.

1662-05-18 22:52   The King and Councell sat till almost eleven o’clock at night, and I forced to walk up and down the gallerys till that time of night.

1662-05-18 11:21   The King came down and offered, and took the sacrament upon his knees; a sight very well worth seeing.

1662-05-18 11:00   A most excellent sermon of Dr. Hacket, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, upon these words: “He that drinketh this water shall never thirst.”

1662-05-17 20:32   To see a velvet cloak, which I buy of Mr. Moore. It will cost me 8l. 10s.; he bought it for 6l. 10s., but it is worth my money.

1662-05-17 14:28   My Lady and Mrs. Sanderson and I on foot to Pater Noster Row to buy a petticoat against the Queen’s coming for my Lady, of plain satin.

1662-05-16 11:40   Up early, Mr. Hater and I to the office, and there I made an end of my book of contracts which I have been making an abstract of.

1662-05-15 21:04   I do not see thorough joy, but only an indifferent one, in the hearts of people who are discontented at the pride and luxury of the Court.

1662-05-15 20:53   All the bells of the town rung, and bonfires made for the joy of the Queen’s arrival, who came and landed at Portsmouth last night.

1662-05-14 20:31   There came Mr. Morelock of Chatham, and brought me a stately cake, and I perceive he has done the same to the rest, of which I was glad.

1662-05-14 17:05   Finding my brother in a lie about the lining of my new morning gown, saying that it was the same with the outside, I was very very angry.

1662-05-14 15:22   My Lady is afeard that my Lady Castlemaine will keep still with the King, and I am afeard she will not, for I love her well.

1662-05-13 22:47   Will Joyce came with a friend, a Cosen of his, to see me and I made them drink a bottle of wine; and so to sing and read and to bed.

1662-05-12 12:30   We were showed the house by Mr. Marriott; which is indeed nobly furnished, particularly the Queen’s bed, given her by the States of Holland.

1662-05-12 10:52   We walked from Mortlake to Richmond, and so to boat again. And from Teddington to Hampton Court Mr. Townsend and I walked again.

1662-05-12 05:04   Mr Townsend called us up; by five the three ladies, my wife and I, and Mr Townsend, his son and daughter, were got to the barge and set out.

1662-05-11 16:08   Walked in the Park, where I saw the King now out of mourning, in a suit laced with gold and silver, which it was said was out of fashion.

1662-05-11 14:30   Dined at home, and my wife’s brother with us, we having a good dish of stewed beef of Jane’s own dressing, which was well done.

1662-05-11 11:22   To our church, where, our Minister being out of town, a dull, flat Presbiter preached.

1662-05-10 19:41   I find that Sir G. Carteret do single me out to join with me apart from the rest, which I am much glad of.

1662-05-10 11:33   Drawing up instructions for Portsmouth yard in those things wherein we at our late being there did think fit to reform.

1662-05-09 21:14   By water home, and so walk upon the leads, and in the dark there played upon my flageolette, it being a fine still evening.

1662-05-09 18:45   To see an Italian puppet play that is within the rayles, which is very pretty, the best that ever I saw, and great resort of gallants.

1662-05-09 17:59   I offered fourteen for the picture — but it is worth much more money — but did not buy it, I having no mind to break my oath.

1662-05-09 17:52   With Mr. Salisbury into Covent Garden to an alehouse, to see a picture that hangs there, which is offered for 20s.

1662-05-09 16:30   To Mr. de Cretz, and there saw some good pieces that he hath copyed of the King’s pieces, some of Raphael and Michael Angelo.

1662-05-09 15:40   Up and to my office, and so to dinner at home, and then to several places to pay my debts.

1662-05-08 22:48   To the office, and was there late doing business, and so with my head full of business I to bed.

1662-05-08 13:50   Sir G Carteret told me that the Queen and the fleet were in Mount’s Bay on Monday last, and that the Queen endures her sickness pretty well.

1662-05-07 17:57   I found Mrs. Turner out at the Theatre, where I saw the last act of the “Knight of the Burning Pestle,” which pleased me not at all.

1662-05-07 15:03   In the business of Chymny money, when all occupiers were to pay, somebody rose and said that women were not occupiers, but occupied.

1662-05-07 09:20   Mr. Montagu is this last night come to the King with news, that he left the Queen and fleet in the Bay of Biscay, coming this wayward.

1662-05-06 21:07   I find it a hard matter to settle to business after so much leisure and pleasure.

1662-05-06 11:44   This morning I got my seat set up on the leads, which pleases me well.

1662-05-05 13:47   My arme not being well, I dined alone at home, my wife being gone out to buy some things for herself, and a gown for me to dress myself in.

1662-05-04 17:27   Homewards, and called in at Antony Joyce’s, where we found his wife brought home sick from church, and was in a convulsion fit.

1662-05-04 16:10   My wife and I walked to Grays Inn, to observe fashions of the ladies, because of my wife’s making some clothes.

1662-05-04 14:55   Our boy begins to wear his sword, to outdo Sir W. Pen’s boy, who this day begins to wear new livery; but I do take mine to be the neatest.

1662-05-04 10:30   I to my chamber to write down my journall from the beginning of my late journey to this house.

1662-05-04 09:44   I begun to be sick; but lying upon my back I was presently well again, and did give Mr. Holliard 5s. for his pains.

1662-05-04 09:20   Mr. Holliard came to me and let me blood, about sixteen ounces, I being exceedingly full of blood and very good.

1662-05-03 19:39   At the goldsmith’s, took my picture in little, which is now done, home with me, and pleases me exceedingly and my wife.

1662-05-03 16:42   Sir Thomas Crew’s children being as pretty and the best behaved that ever I saw of their age.

1662-05-03 15:50   To my Lady Sandwich, and Sir Thomas Crew’s children coming thither, I took them and all my Ladys to the Tower and showed them the lions.

1662-05-03 10:40   To Westminster, where I met Mr. Moore, and hear that Mr. Watkins is suddenly dead since my going.

1662-05-02 20:45   However, I staid till my courage was up, and talked to them, and viewed her house, which is most pleasant, and so drank and good-night.

1662-05-02 20:42   Dr. Clerke’s lady is a fine woman. What with her person and the number of fine ladies, I could hardly carry myself like a man among them.

1662-05-02 14:20   I found all well at home, and Mr. Hunt and his wife had dined with my wife to-day, and been very kind to my wife in my absence.

1662-05-01 22:05   To Gilford, where after supper I to bed, having this day been offended by Sir W. Pen’s foolish talk, and I offending him with my answers.

1662-05-01 13:45   Comes my Lord Carlingford from London: tells us that the Duchess of York is brought to bed of a girl, at which I find nobody pleased.

1662-05-01 13:30   Set out from Portsmouth very early, and got to Petersfield; several officers of the Yard accompanying us. Here we dined and were merry.

1662-05-01 01:00   Our discourse being much about the quality of the lady with Mrs. Pierce, she being somewhat old and handsome, and painted and fine.

1662-05-01 00:10   The Doctor and I bade the ladies good night, and so past the guards, and went to his lodgings, and there lay with him.
