1662-04-30 21:50   The Doctor being come to us to the ladies’ lodgings, whither came our supper, and we very merry, playing at cards and laughing very merry.

1662-04-30 11:30   Sir G. Carteret came down to the yard, and there we mustered over all the men and determined of some regulations in the yard.

1662-04-29 22:20   The Doctor and I walked to the yard, designing how to prevent our going to London tomorrow, that we might be merry with these ladies.

1662-04-29 22:00   The Doctor and I staid with the ladies playing and laughing, and at last were forced to bid good night for fear of being locked in the town.

1662-04-29 18:50   We carried the ladies by coach to their lodging, which was very poor, but the best they could get, and such as made much mirth among us.

1662-04-29 16:40   I walked with Mrs. Pierce and another lady up and down, and took them to Mrs. Stephens, and there gave them wine and sweetmeats.

1662-04-28 09:10   The Doctor offers to bring me into the college of virtuosoes and my Lord Brouncker’s acquaintance, and show me anatomy, which makes me glad.

1662-04-27 16:50   Mr Timbrell showed us the present they have for the Queen; a salt-sellar of silver with four eagles and four greyhounds standing at the top.

1662-04-27 13:40   To the Yard, and there on board the Swallow in the dock hear our navy chaplain preach a sad sermon, full of nonsense and false Latin.

1662-04-27 11:10   I spoke and saluted Mrs. Pierce, but being in haste could not learn of her where her lodgings are, which vexes me.

1662-04-27 11:00   I followed my Lord Chamberlain in the crowd of gallants through the Queen’s lodgings to chappell; the rooms being all rarely furnished.

1662-04-27 07:30   Sir W. Pen got trimmed before me, and so took the coach to Portsmouth to wait on my Lord Steward, and sent the coach for me back again.

1662-04-26 16:20   To horse again, being in nothing troubled but the badness of my hat, which I borrowed to save my beaver.

1662-04-26 15:50   Southampton is one most gallant street, and is walled round with stone; many old walls of religious houses, and the key, well worth seeing.

1662-04-26 14:40   They brought us caveare, which I attempted to order, but to no purpose, for they had neither given it salt enough, nor are the seedes broke.

1662-04-26 14:10   At Southampton we went to the Mayor’s and dined, and had sturgeon of their own catching the last week, which do not happen in twenty years.

1662-04-26 11:00   Besides my Lord Southampton’s parks and lands, we observed a little church-yard, where the graves are accustomed to be all sowed with sage.

1662-04-26 09:10   Sir George and I, and his clerk Mr. Stephens, and Mr. Holt our guide, over to Gosport; and so rode to Southampton.

1662-04-25 22:40   I was much troubled in my eyes, by reason of the healths I have this day been forced to drink.

1662-04-25 14:20   All the morning at Portsmouth, at the Pay, and then to dinner, and again to the Pay.

1662-04-24 22:20   W. Pen and I walked to the King’s Yard, and there lay at Mr. Tippets’s, where exceeding well treated.

1662-04-24 10:20   To the Pay-house; but the books not being ready, we went to church, where there was much London company, though not so much as I expected.

1662-04-24 08:20   We lay very well; concluding Dr. Clerke to be of the eldest blood of the Clerkes, because that all the fleas came to him and not to me.

1662-04-23 22:40   The Doctor and I lay together at Wiard’s, the chyrurgeon’s, in Portsmouth, his wife a very pretty woman.

1662-04-23 18:10   I did project to make good my oath, that my wife should come if any of our wives came, which my Lady Batten did intend with her husband.

1662-04-23 13:30   Up early, and to Petersfield, and there dined well; and thence got a countryman to guide us by Havant, to avoid going through the Forest.

1662-04-22 19:30   We came to Gilford and passed our time in the garden, cutting of sparagus, the best that ever I eat in my life but in the house last year.

1662-04-22 15:40   Dr. Clerke telling us of the monkey that got hold of the young lady’s cunt as she went to stool to shit, and run from under her coats.

1662-04-22 09:30   We got a dish of buttered eggs, and there staid till Sir G. Carteret came to us, who brought Dr. Clerke with him, at which I was very glad.

1662-04-22 07:40   After taking leave of my wife, which we could hardly do kindly, because of her mind to go with me, Sir W. Pen and I took coach to Lambeth.

1662-04-21 15:20   My Lord told me that the Queen is landed; I hurried to White Hall, the bells ringing in several places; but I found there no such matter.

1662-04-21 06:45   I attempted to persuade my wife to go to Brampton. Seeing that I could keep it no longer I told her that I was resolved to go to Portsmouth.

1662-04-20 15:20   To White Hall to Sir G. Carteret, and so to the Chappell, where I challenged my pew as Clerk of the Privy Seal and had it.

1662-04-20 09:30   My intention being to go to White Hall, it did rain, and the wind against me, that I could by no means get a boat or coach to carry me.

1662-04-19 19:40   I did get a bever, an old one, but a good one, of Sir W. Batten, for which I must give him something; but I am very well pleased with it.

1662-04-19 09:10   I did see Barkestead, Okey, and Corbet, drawn towards the gallows; and there they were hanged and quartered. They all looked very cheerful.

1662-04-18 12:10   My mind is at a great loss what to do with my wife, for I cannot persuade her to go to Brampton, and I am loth to leave her at home.

1662-04-18 10:00   I told Jane how much I did love the boy for her sake, and how much it do concern to correct the boy. So at last she was well pleased.

1662-04-18 09:45   The boy’s sister came to me down and begged for him. So I forebore.

1662-04-18 09:40   Sending the boy into the cellar for some beer I followed him with a cane and did there beat him for his staying of arrands and other faults.

1662-04-17 19:50   Sir W. Batten told me that he had spoke to the Duke about raising our houses, and he hath given us leave to do it, at which I am glad.

1662-04-17 09:10   To Mr. Holliard’s in the morning, thinking to be let blood, but he was gone out.

1662-04-16 11:40   Up early and took my physique; it wrought all the morning well.

1662-04-15 18:20   We saw some new-fashion pettycoats of sarcenett, with a black broad lace printed round the bottom, very handsome, but we did not buy one.

1662-04-15 18:00   With my wife, by coach, to the New Exchange, to buy her some things.

1662-04-14 20:22   And yet all my design was that I might the freer go to Portsmouth when the rest go to pay off the yards there, which will be very shortly.

1662-04-14 20:20   Whether my wife suspected anything or no I know not, but she is quite off of her going to Brampton, which something troubles me.

1662-04-14 18:00   To Paternoster Row to buy things for my wife against her going.

1662-04-14 16:10   We to the Paynter’s, and there sat the last time for my little picture, which I hope will please me.

1662-04-14 09:20   I lay very long in bed to-day, talking with my wife, and persuaded her to go to Brampton, next week, to cure her ague by change of ayre.

1662-04-13 20:20   Mr. Pickering intends to go to Portsmouth to meet the Queen this week; which is now the discourse and expectation of the town.

1662-04-13 20:05   To Graye’s Inn walkes; and there met Mr. Pickering and walked with him two hours till I was quite weary.

1662-04-13 15:40   I went to the Temple to Church. A boy, being asleep, fell down a high seat to the ground, ready to break his neck, but got no hurt.

1662-04-12 16:30   I wrote a letter to Mr. Coventry about business, and did excuse my not waiting on him myself so often as others do for want of leisure.

1662-04-12 11:40   Being provoked by some impertinence of Sir W. Batten’s, I called him unreasonable man, at which he was very angry and so was I.

1662-04-11 22:50   Home and walked with my wife on the leads late, and so the barber came to me, and so to bed very weary, which I seldom am.

1662-04-11 13:10   At Greenwich we walked into the Park, where the King hath planted trees and made steps in the hill up to the Castle, which is magnificent.

1662-04-11 10:20   Captn. Minnes and the other Captains tell me that negros drowned look white and lose their blackness, which I never heard before.

1662-04-11 06:10   With Sir W. Pen by water to Deptford; and among the ships now going to Portugall with men and horse, to see them dispatched.

1662-04-11 05:30   Up early to my lute and a song.

1662-04-10 22:40   Late at the office. Home with my mind full of business. So to bed.

1662-04-10 13:30   Yesterday came Col. Talbot with letters from Portugall, that the Queen is resolved to embarque for England this week.

1662-04-09 13:10   Sir George showed me an account of the famine, which is to the greatest extremity in some part of France at this day, which is very strange.

1662-04-09 12:50   To dinner at the Dolphin, where a good chine of beef and other good cheer.

1662-04-08 20:30   By the way home and on Ludgate Hill there being a stop I bought two cakes, and they were our supper at home.

1662-04-08 13:10   I sent for a barrel of oysters and a breast of veal roasted, and were very merry; but I cannot down with their dull company and impertinent.

1662-04-08 12:00   So to dinner, and in comes uncle Fenner and the two Joyces. 

1662-04-07 21:10   The great talk is, that the Spaniards and the Hollanders do intend to set upon the Portuguese, at Lisbon, as soon as our fleet is come away.

1662-04-07 14:20   I was troubled in my head after the little wine I drank, and did promise to drink no more wine but one glass a meal till Whitsuntide next.

1662-04-07 10:00   I desired my Lord Privy Seal would make another deputy for me; but he told me he could not do it without the King’s consent, which vexed me.

1662-04-06 17:40   To Graye’s Inn walks, the first time I have been there this year, and it is very pleasant and full of good company.

1662-04-06 14:30   With Sir G. Carteret to his lodgings to dinner, with him and his lady, where I saluted her, and was well received as a stranger by her.

1662-04-06 11:23   Among other things, he did much insist upon the sin of adultery: which methought might touch the King.

1662-04-06 11:20   I heard a very honest sermon before the King by a Canon of Christ Church, upon these words, “Having a form of godliness, but denying,” &c.

1662-04-06 09:40   By water to White Hall, to Sir G. Carteret, to give him an account of the backwardness of the ships we have hired to Portugall.

1662-04-05 20:00   By coach first to Moorfields and there walked, and thence to Islington and had a fine walk in the fields there.

1662-04-05 15:50   Sir W. Batten and I viewed our houses with a workman in order to the raising of our roofs higher to enlarge our houses.

1662-04-05 12:45   Sir G. Carteret seemed much pleased with me, and I hope will be the ground of a future interest of mine in him, which I shall be glad of.

1662-04-05 12:35   Sir G. Carteret and I walked together alone in the garden, taking notice of some faults in the office, particularly of Sir W. Batten’s.

1662-04-04 19:30   I was troubled to see a dead man floating upon the waters, and had done four days. Nobody takes him up to bury him, which is very barbarous.

1662-04-04 13:10   By barge Sir George, Sir Williams both and I to Deptford, and there fell to pay off the Drake and Hampshire, then to dinner.

1662-04-03 18:30   At home and at the office all day.

1662-04-02 17:55   Met Mr. Sanchy, Smithes, Gale, and Edlin at the play, but having no great mind to spend money, I left them there.

1662-04-02 17:40   My wife and I saw “The Bondman” most excellently acted; and though we had seen it so often, yet I never liked it better than to-day.

1662-04-02 11:20   We got places and staid to hear a sermon; but, it being a Presbyterian one, it was so long, that after above an hour of it we went away.

1662-04-02 10:15   Mr. Moore and I to the Spittle before my Lord Mayor and the blewcoat boys come, which they did, and a fine sight of charity it is indeed.

1662-04-01 19:40   I took them to Islington, and then, after a walk in the fields, I took them to the great cheese-cake house and entertained them.

1662-04-01 15:25   I sent the maid of the house into a room to my Lady Paulina, and she did what she had a mind to, and so back again to the play.

1662-04-01 15:15   My Lady Paulina, who had taken physique this morning, had need to go forth, and so I took the poor lady out and carried her to the Grange.

1662-04-01 14:20   Mr. Herbert and I and the two young ladies and my wife to the playhouse, the Opera, and saw “The Mayde in the Mill,” a pretty good play.

1662-04-01 12:10   I paid our maid Nell her whole wages, who has been with me half a year, and now goes away for altogether.
