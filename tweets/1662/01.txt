1662-01-31 12:05   All the morning, after musique practice, in my cellar, ordering alteracons therein, being much pleased with my new door into the back yard.

1662-01-30 21:52   I think I shall begin to take pleasure in being at home and minding my business. I pray God I may, for I find a great need thereof.

1662-01-30 11:32   To church, and Mr. Mills made a good sermon upon David’s words, “Who can lay his hands upon the Lord’s Anoynted and be guiltless?”

1662-01-29 20:42   When the pullet was ready to come to table, the foolish girl had not the manners to stay and sup, but went away, which did vex me cruelly.

1662-01-29 20:08   Home, where I found Mrs. Pen and Mrs. Rooth and Smith at cards with my wife. I did give them a barrel of oysters and had a pullet to supper.

1662-01-28 13:22   The Paynter I found to be silly as to matter of skill in shadows, for we were long in discourse till I was angry to hear him talk so simply.

1662-01-28 13:09   To the Paynter’s, where we staid very late to have my wife’s picture mended, which at last is come to be like her, and I think well done.

1662-01-27 08:58   We met with sleddes to carry my Lord Monson and Sir H. Mildmay and another, to the gallows and back again, with ropes about their necks.

1662-01-26 22:30   Thanks be to God, since my leaving drinking of wine, I mind my business better, and do spend less money, and less time lost in idle company.

1662-01-26 16:28   It having been a very fine clear frosty day — God send us more of them, for the warm weather all this winter makes us fear a sick summer.

1662-01-25 17:10   To dinner, but I eat too much beef, which made me sick, and so after dinner we went to the office, and there in a garden I went and vomited.

1662-01-25 10:52   Sir W. Pen did break a business to me about removing his son from Oxford to Cambridge to some private college. I proposed Magdalene.

1662-01-25 10:03   Walking in the garden to give the gardener directions what to do this year (for I intend to have the garden handsome).

1662-01-24 19:28   So home, in my way calling at Pope’s Head alley, and there bought me a pair of scissars and a brass square.

1662-01-24 15:08   I sent for the pictures, and mine is well liked; but my Lady is offended with my wife’s, and I am of her opinion, that it do much wrong her.

1662-01-24 09:43   To my painter’s, and there I saw our pictures in the frames, which please me well. 

1662-01-23 14:58   I took aside the two Joyces, to thank them for their kind thoughts for a wife for Tom, but I think he may expect a wife with more money.

1662-01-23 14:09   To the Three Crane Tavern, and though the best room, in such a narrow dogg-hole we were crammed it made me loathe my company and victuals.

1662-01-23 12:58   By coach by invitacon to my uncle Fenner’s, where I found his new wife, a pitiful, old, ugly, illbred woman in a hatt, a midwife.

1662-01-22 15:50   I to have a meeting with T. Trice in order to a treating about the difference between us. I find there is no hopes of ending it but by law.

1662-01-22 11:48   To the Hall, where I heard the House had ordered all the King’s murderers, that remain, to be executed, but Fleetwood and Downes.

1662-01-22 10:14   There are factions about Madam Palmer; what it is about I know not. Something about the King’s favour to her now that the Queen is coming.

1662-01-22 09:43   The House said they had found how that man that hath the command of an army is not beholden to any body to make him King.

1662-01-22 09:04   To Westminster, in my way calling at Mr. George Montagu’s, to condole him the loss of his son, who was a fine gentleman.

1662-01-21 21:58   We have heard nothing yet how far the fleet hath got toward Portugall, but the wind being changed again, we fear they are stopped.

1662-01-21 13:50   To the finishing of the Treasurer’s accounts this morning, and then to dinner again, and were merry as yesterday.

1662-01-20 23:52   This day the workmen began to make me a sellar door out of the back yard, which will much please me.

1662-01-20 21:32   My aunt and uncle Wight and Mrs. Anne Wight came to play at cards (at gleek which she taught me and my wife last week) and so to supper.

1662-01-20 15:20   The vessel was filled up with four gallons of Malaga wine. It is the first great quantity of wine that I ever bought.

1662-01-20 15:12   Mr. Morrice, the wine cooper, did divide the two butts, which we four did send for, of sherry from Cales, and mine was put into a hogshead.

1662-01-19 20:09   I am troubled to hear that the Turks do take more of our ships in the Straights, and that our merchants here in London do daily break.

1662-01-19 19:44   To my uncle Wight’s, and there we supped and were merry, though my uncle hath lately lost 200 or 300 at sea.

1662-01-19 14:54   My uncle Fenner has lately married a midwife that is old and ugly, and that hath already brought home to him a daughter and three children.

1662-01-19 11:31   Mr. Mills preached upon Christ’s being offered up for our sins, and he did make such a sermon that I could have wished he had let it alone.

1662-01-18 13:15   To the Wardrobe, and hearing it would be late before they went to dinner, I went and spent some time in Paul’s Churchyard among some books.

1662-01-18 09:20   Dr. Williams told me how T. Trice had spoke to him about getting me to meet that our difference might be made up between us by ourselves.

1662-01-17 15:20   In the Piazza seeing a house on fire, and all the streets full of people to quench it.

1662-01-17 14:58   Mr. George Montagu's house hear nothing at all of our young Lord; so believing that thence comes the mistake, I returned to my Lord Crew.

1662-01-17 14:54   I found Mr. George Montagu’s house in great heaviness for the death of his son, who did go with our young gentlemen into France.

1662-01-17 10:14   Lany told me that he had a letter from France last night, that tells him my Lord Hinchingbroke is dead, which do surprise me exceedingly.

1662-01-16 20:28   Stokes also told us that the kings in Gambo have above 100 wives a-piece, and offered him the choice of any of his wives to lie with.

1662-01-16 20:23   Stokes told us that the people of the country of Gambo live very long. The present king there is 150 years old, which they count by rains.

1662-01-16 12:22   I to the Paynter’s, and there paid him 6l. for the two pictures, and 36s. for the two frames.

1662-01-16 11:03   In Paul’s Churchyard saw the funeral of my Lord Cornwallis, late Steward of the King’s House, a bold profane talking man, go by.

1662-01-15 10:24   It is, both as to warmth and every other thing, just as if it were the middle of May or June, which do threaten a plague to follow.

1662-01-15 10:20   Mr Berkenshaw tells me that it is a fast day ordered by the Parliament, to pray for more seasonable weather; it having been summer weather.

1662-01-15 09:42   Mr Berkenshaw came again, and after he had examined me and taught me something in my work he and I went to breakfast upon a collar of brawn.

1662-01-14 19:12   This day my brave vellum covers to keep pictures in, come in, which pleases me very much.

1662-01-13 18:14   My aunt Wight teaching of us how to play at gleeke, which is a pretty game; but I have not my head so free as to be troubled with it.

1662-01-13 15:03   Mr. Peter did show us the experiment of the chymicall glasses, which break all to dust by breaking off a little small end.

1662-01-13 10:37   Mr Berkenshaw staid with me a great while talking of musique, and I am resolved to begin to learn of him to compose, and to begin to-morrow.

1662-01-12 21:07   Home and to read, I being troubled to hear my wife rate though not without cause at her mayd Nell, who is a lazy slut.

1662-01-12 16:08   My wife and I to visit Mrs. Turner, who continues very ill still, and The. is also fallen sick, which do trouble me for the poor mother.

1662-01-11 10:03   To the Exchange, and there all the news is of the French and Dutch joyning against us; but I do not think it yet true.

1662-01-10 16:31   To meet my wife at Mrs. Hunt’s to gossip with her, which we did, and were merry, and did give her a cup and spoon for my wife’s god-child.

1662-01-10 09:04   To Sir Paul Neale about a mathematical request of my Lord’s, something about observation of the moon and stars, but what I did not mind.

1662-01-09 20:41   I found Mr. Armiger talking with my wife, but being offended with him for his leaving of my brother Tom I shewed him no countenance.

1662-01-08 21:52   This night come about 100l. from Brampton by carrier to me, in holsters from my father, which made me laugh.

1662-01-08 09:14   Sir G Carteret is angry against my man Will that he is every other day with the Commissioners of Parliament, and that his uncle was a rogue.

1662-01-07 22:38   To Sir W. Pen’s, there supped and played at cards with them and were merry, the children being to go all away to school again to-morrow.

1662-01-06 23:17   Though he was asleep I sent for my man out of his bed and he rose and came up to me. I appeared very angry and did tax him with being drunk.

1662-01-06 22:58   I hear that my man Gull was gone to bed, and upon enquiry I hear that he did vomit before he went to bed, and complained his head ached.

1662-01-06 14:22   I perceive Major Holmes would fain get to be free with my wife, but I shall prevent it, and she herself hath also a defyance against him.

1662-01-06 13:58   To Sir W. Pen’s, it being a solemn feast day with him. We had eighteen mince pies in a dish, the number of years that he hath been married.

1662-01-06 11:48   I sent my lute to the Paynter’s, and there I staid to see him paint the neck of my lute in my picture, which I was not pleased with.

1662-01-05 15:43   The Clerk begins the 25th psalm, which hath a proper tune, and then the 116th, which cannot be sung with that tune, which seemed ridiculous.

1662-01-04 14:07   My wife and I and East to Wilkinson’s to dinner, where we had some rost beef and a mutton pie, and a mince-pie, but none of them pleased me.

1662-01-04 12:20   Mr. Chetwin had a dog challenged of him by another man that said it was his, but Mr. Chetwin called the dog, and the dog would follow him.

1662-01-03 11:49   To Tom’s, who I find great hopes of that he will do well, which I am glad of, and am not now so hasty to get a wife for him as I was before.

1662-01-03 10:52   Lay long in bed, and so up and abroad to several places about petty businesses.

1662-01-02 13:42   Mr. W. Montagu’s Lady is so far from the beauty that I expected her to be that it put me into an ill humour, to find my expectation so lost.

1662-01-01 18:42   Mr. W. Pen left his sword in the coach, and so he run out, and by chance did at the Exchange meet with the coach and got his sword again.

1662-01-01 17:21   After we had eat a barrel of oysters we went to the play, and a good play it is, only Diego the Sexton did overdo his part too much.

1662-01-01 10:10   Mr. W. Pen came to me and he and I walked out, and to the Stacioner’s, and looked over some pictures and maps for my house.

1662-01-01 09:20   Seeing that the “Spanish Curate” was acted today, I sent to young Mr. Pen and his sister to go anon with my wife and I to the Theatre.

1662-01-01 06:59   Waking on a sudden, I did with my elbow hit my wife a great blow over her face and nose, which waked her with pain, at which I was sorry.
