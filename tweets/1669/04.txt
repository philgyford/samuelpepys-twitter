1669-04-15 15:58 r The. and Betty Turner in new flowered tabby gowns, and so we were pretty merry, only my fear upon me for what I had newly done, do keep my content in.

1669-04-15 15:45 r But, the truth is, there are so many bad pictures, that to me make the good ones lose much of the pleasure in seeing them.

1669-04-15 15:22 r To Povy’s, and thither I, and there they were all, and W. Batelier and his sister, and had dined; but I had good things brought me, and then all up and down the house, and mightily pleased to see the fine rooms.

1669-04-15 14:35 r When I come back to the place where I left my coach it was gone, I having staid too long, which did trouble me to abuse the poor fellow, so that taking another coach I did direct him to find out the fellow and send him to me.

1669-04-15 14:23 r I did give her in a paper 20s., and we did agree para meet again in the Hall at Westminster on Monday next; and so giving me great hopes by her carriage that she continues modest and honest, we did there part.

1669-04-15 14:07 r Without standing in the street desired her to follow me, and I led her into a little blind alehouse within the walls, and there she and I alone fell to talk and besar la and tocar su mamelles, but she mighty coy, and I hope modest.

1669-04-15 13:17 r I saw her, and she me, but she made no stop, but seemed unwilling to speak to me; so I away on, but then stopped and ’light, and after her and overtook her at the end of Hosier lane in Smithfield.

1669-04-15 13:04 r I away, and through Jewen Street, my mind, God knows, running that way, but stopped not, but going down Holborne hill, by the Conduit, I did see Deb. on foot going up the hill.

1669-04-15 12:22 r I to the place, and there, after walking up and down by the windmills, I did find her and talk with her, but it being holiday and the place full of people, we parted, leaving further discourse and doing to another time.

1669-04-15 09:55 r But to the office I must go and did, but coming thither I find Bagwell’s wife, who did give me a little note into my hand, wherein I find her para invite me para meet her in Moorfields this noon, where I might speak with her.

1669-04-15 09:20   To the Excise Office with W. Hewer, but found some occasion to go another way to the Temple, and I by Deb.’s direction did know whither in Jewen Street to direct my hackney coachman, to go thither to enquire whether Mrs. Hunt, her aunt, was in town, who brought word she was not.

1669-04-14 22:04   Home, and there to talk and to supper and to bed, all being very safe as to my seeing of poor Deb. yesterday.

1669-04-14 19:55 r But they do here talk mightily of my Lady Paulina making a good end, and being mighty religious in her lifetime; and hath left many good notes of sermons and religion; wrote with her own hand,  which nobody ever knew of; which I am glad of: but she was always a peevish lady.

1669-04-14 19:27 r Here they treat us like strangers, quite according to the fashion — nothing to drink or eat, which is a thing that will spoil our ever having any acquaintance with them; for we do continue the old freedom and kindness of England to all our friends.

1669-04-14 18:43 r We to Creed’s, and there find him and her together alone, in their new house, where I never was before, they lodging before at the next door, and a pretty house it is; but I do not see that they intend to keep any coach.

1669-04-14 17:40   Out with my own coach to the Duke of York’s play-house, and there saw “The Impertinents,” a play which pleases me well still; but it is with great trouble that I now see a play, because of my eyes, the light of the candles making it very troublesome to me.

1669-04-13 22:20 r So home to supper, where very sparing in my discourse, not giving occasion of any enquiry where I have been today, or what I have done, and so without any trouble tonight more than my fear, we to bed.

1669-04-13 20:40 r But my great pain is lest God Almighty shall suffer me to find out this girl, whom indeed I love, and with a bad amour, but I will pray to God to give me grace to forbear it.

1669-04-13 20:10 r So home to my wife, who is come home from Deptford. But, God forgive me, I hardly know how to put on confidence enough to speak as innocent, having had this passage today with Deb., though only, God knows, by accident.

1669-04-13 19:14 r Back home through Crutched Friars, and there saw Mary Mercer, and put off my hat to her, on the other side of the way, but it being a little darkish she did not, I think, know me well, and so to my office to put my papers in order.

1669-04-13 18:03 r But I did speak to her and she to me, and did get her para docere me ou she demeures now. And did charge her para say nothing of me that I had vu elle, which she did promise, and so with my heart full of surprize and disorder I away.

1669-04-13 17:49 r I presently could not refrain, but sent W. Hewer away to look for Mr. Wren, and I run after her and two women and a man, and she in her old clothes, and after hunting a little, find them in the lobby of the chapel below stairs, and there I observed she endeavoured to avoid me.

1669-04-13 17:30 r I away home, and there sent for W. Hewer, and he and I by water to White Hall to look among other things, for Mr. May, to unbespeak his dining with me tomorrow. But here being in the court-yard, God would have it, I spied Deb., which made my heart and head to work.

1669-04-13 14:44 r There being a good piece of cold roast beef upon the tables and one Margetts, a young merchant that lodges there, and is likely to marry a sister of hers, I staid and eat, and had much good conversation with her, who hath the vanity to talk of her great friends and father.

1669-04-13 13:24 r I took occasion to go back to this milliner’s, whose name I now understand to be Clerke; and there, her husband inviting me up to the balcony, to see the sight go by to dine at Clothworker’s-Hall, I did go up and there saw it go by.

1669-04-13 12:42 r I by hackney-coach to the Spittle, and heard a piece of a dull sermon to my Lord Mayor and Aldermen, and thence saw them all take horse and ride away, which I have not seen together many a-day; their wives also went in their coaches; and, indeed, the sight was mighty pleasing.

1669-04-13 11:50 r And there, meeting both him and her in the shop, I bought a pair of gloves, and fell to talk, and found so much freedom that I stayed there the best part of the morning till towards noon, with great pleasure, it being a holiday.

1669-04-13 09:50   At the Office a good while, and then, my wife going down the River to spend the day with her mother at Deptford, I abroad, and first to the milliner’s in Fenchurch Street, over against Rawlinson’s.

1669-04-12 22:10 r Home, and after sitting an hour, thrumming upon my viall, and singing, I to bed, and left my wife to do something to a waistcoat and petticoat she is to wear tomorrow.

1669-04-12 20:38 r Here he showed me the model of his houses that he is going to build in Cornhill and Lumbard Street; but he hath purchased so much there, that it looks like a little town, and must have cost him a great deal of money.

1669-04-12 19:50 r Coming home, we overtook Alderman Backewell’s coach and his lady, and followed them to their house, and there made them the first visit, where they received us with extraordinary civility, and owning the obligation.

1669-04-12 16:30 r He did soundly beat the soldier, and cut him over the head. Thence back to White Hall, mightily pleased, all of us, with this sight, and particularly this fellow, as a most extraordinary man for his temper and evenness in fighting.

1669-04-12 15:45 r Here we saw a prize fought between a soldier and country fellow, one Warrell, who promised the least in his looks, and performed the most of valour in his boldness and evenness of mind, and smiles in all he did, and we were all both deceived and infinitely taken with him.

1669-04-12 15:10 r By water to the Bear-Garden, and there happened to sit by Sir Fretcheville Hollis, who is still full of his vain-glorious and prophane talk.

1669-04-12 13:40 r To my wife at Unthanke’s, and with her was Jane, and so to the Cocke, where they, and I, and Sheres, and Tom dined, my wife having a great desire to eat of their soup made of pease, and dined very well.

1669-04-12 10:55 r I up and down the house, talking with this man and that, and: then meeting Mr. Sheres, took him to see the fine flower-pot I saw yesterday, and did again offer 20l. for it; but he insists upon 50l.

1669-04-12 09:20   To White Hall, where I of the whole Office attended the Duke of York at his meeting with Sir Thomas Allen and several flag-officers, to consider of the manner of managing the war with Algiers; and, it being a thing I was wholly silent in, I did only observe.

1669-04-11 22:10   To my office, and there set down my journal, with the help of my left eye through my tube, for fourteen days’ past; which is so much, as, I hope, I shall not run in arrear again, but the badness of my eyes do force me to it.

1669-04-11 17:15   I took my wife to St. James’s, and there carried her to the Queen’s Chapel, the first time I ever did it; and heard excellent music, but not so good as by accident I did hear there yesterday, as I went through the Park from White Hall to see Sir W. Coventry.

1669-04-11 15:55 r He do ask 70l. for it: I had the vanity to bid him 20l.; but a better picture I never saw in my whole life; and it is worth going twenty miles to see it.

1669-04-11 15:50 r He took us to his lodging close by, and did show us a little flower-pot of his doing, the finest thing that ever I saw in my life; the drops of dew hanging on the leaves, so as I was forced, again and again, to put my finger to it, to feel whether my eyes were deceived or no.

1669-04-11 14:32   My wife and I out by coach, and Balty with us, to Loton, the landscape-drawer, a Dutchman, living in St. James’s Market, but there saw no good pictures. But by accident he did direct us to a painter that was then in the house with him, a Dutchman, newly come over, one Evarelst.

1669-04-11 11:15   To Church; where Alderman Backewell’s wife, and mother, and boy, and another gentlewoman, did come, and sit in our pew; but no women of our own there, and so there was room enough.

1669-04-10 14:58   I hear by Mr. Seymour that Captain Trevanion do give it out every where that I did overrule the whole Court-martiall against him, as long as I was there; and perhaps I may receive, this time, some wrong by it: but I care not, for what I did was out of my desire of doing justice.

1669-04-09 16:08   To Westminster Hall, and I took occasion to make a step to Mrs. Martin’s, the first time I have been with her since her husband went last to sea, which is I think a year since but yo did now hazer con ella what I would, though she had ellos upon her; but yo did algo.

1669-04-09 14:15   Out again with W. Hewer to the Excise-Office, and to several places; among others, to Mr. Faythorne’s, to have seen an instrument which he was said to have, for drawing perspectives, but he had it not: but I did see his work-house, and the best things of his doing he had by him.

1669-04-09 10:05   By water to White Hall, and there, with the Board, attended the Duke of York, and Sir Thomas Allen with us (who come to town yesterday); and it is resolved another fleet shall go to the Streights forthwith, and he command it.

1669-04-08 21:10   To the office again till the evening, and then with my wife by coach to Islington, to pay what we owe there, for the late dinner at Jane’s wedding; and so round by Kingsland and Hogsden home, pleased with my wife’s singing with me, by the way.

1669-04-08 14:14   Going through Smithfield, I did see a coach run over the coachman’s neck, and stand upon it, and yet the man rose up, and was well after it, which I thought a wonder.

1669-04-08 09:52   To White Hall, to the King’s side, to find Sir T. Clifford, where the Duke of York come and found me, which I was sorry for, for fear he should think I was making friends on that side. But I did put it off the best I could, my being there.

1669-04-07 21:21   This day I do hear that Betty Turner is to be left at school at Hackney, which I am mightily pleased with; for then I shall, now and then, see her. She is pretty, and a girl for that, and her relations, I love.

1669-04-07 19:33 r Hither come Mr. Eden, who was in his mistress’s disfavour ever since the other night that he come in thither fuddled. But I did make them friends by my buffoonery, and bringing up a way of spelling their names, and mighty merry we were.

1669-04-07 18:40   To my cousin Turner’s, and thence with her and her daughters, and her sister Turner, I carrying Betty in my lap, to Talbot’s chamber at the Temple, where, by agreement, the poor rogue had a pretty dish of anchovies and sweetmeats for them.

1669-04-07 16:50 r But the King and Council did forbear to determine any thing it, till the other business of the title and privilege be decided which is now under dispute at law between them, whether Temple be within the liberty of the City or no.

1669-04-07 16:28   To the Council-Chamber and there heard the great complaint of the City, tried against the gentlemen of the Temple, for the late riot, when my Lord Mayor was there. But, upon hearing the whole business, the City was certainly to blame to charge them in this manner as with a riot.

1669-04-07 14:10 r Back again to the Cocke, and there find Mr. Turner, Betty, and Talbot Pepys, and they dined with myself Sir D. Gawden and Gibson, and mighty merry, this house being famous for good meat, and particularly pease-porridge.

1669-04-07 12:44   I to the New Exchange to talk with Betty, my little sempstress; and so to Mrs. Turner’s, to call them to dinner, but my wife not come, I back again, and was overtaken by a porter, with a message from my wife that she was ill, and could not come to us.

1669-04-07 12:05   To the Lords of the Treasury, where all the morning, and settled matters to their liking about the assignments on the Customes, between the Navy Office and Victualler, and to that end spent most of the morning there with D. Gawden.

1669-04-06 21:08   I home, and there come home my wife, who hath been with Batelier’s late, and been dancing with the company, at which I seemed a little troubled, not being sent for thither myself, but I was not much so, but went to bed well enough pleased.

1669-04-06 16:22   Middleton and I did in acquaint the Duke of York what we had observed in the late Court-martiall; and though he thinks not fit to revoke what is already done in this case, yet it shall bring forth some good laws in the behaviour of Captains to their under Officers.

1669-04-06 14:20   To the Excise Office about some business, and so back to the office and sat till late, and thence to Mr. Batelier’s to dinner, where my cozen Turner and both her daughters, and Talbot Pepys and my wife, and a mighty fine dinner.

1669-04-05 21:40 r Home, mightily pleased with the day’s work. This day come another new mayd, for a middle maid, her name I know not yet; and, for a cookmaid, we have, ever since Bridget went, used a blackmoore of Mr. Batelier’s, Doll, who dresses our meat well, and we mightily pleased with her.

1669-04-05 19:44 r Meeting The. Turner, Talbot, W. Batelier, and his sister, in a coach, we anon took them with us to the Mulberry Garden; and there, after a walk, to supper upon what was left at noon; and very good.

1669-04-05 17:10 r By the way, we overtook Captain Ferrers upon his fine Spanish horse, and he is a fine horse indeed; but not so good, I think, as I have seen some. He did ride by us most of the way, and with us to the Park, and there left us.

1669-04-05 16:34 r Took coach again, and went five or six miles towards Branford, the Prince of Tuscany, who comes into England only to spend money and see our country; and we met him, but the coach passing by apace, we could not see much of him but he seems a very jolly and good comely man.

1669-04-05 14:40 r This, and the discourse he did give us of Spain, and description of the Escuriall, was a fine treat. So we left other good things, that would keep till night, for a collation.

1669-04-05 14:15   To the Mulberry Garden, where Sheres is to treat us with a Spanish Olio, by a cook of his acquaintance that is there, that was with my Lord in Spain: and he did do it, and mighty nobly; and the Olio was indeed a very noble dish, such as I never saw better, or any more of.

1669-04-05 11:09   I spent a little time with Creed walking in the garden, and talking about our Office, and I did think he might do me a kindness to learn of him what the Duke of Buckingham and the faction do design touching me, and to instil good words concerning me, which I believe he will.

1669-04-04 22:20   Home, where got my wife to read to me; and so after supper to bed. The Queen-Mother hath been of late mighty ill, and some fears of her death.

1669-04-04 15:40   With Sir J. Minnes and T. Middleton to White Hall, by appointment; and at my Lord Arlington’s the Office did attend the King and Cabal, to discourse the further quantity of victuals fit to be declared for, which was 2,000 men for six months.

1669-04-04 11:04   To church, where Alderman Backewell’s wife, by my invitation with my head, come up with her mother, and sat with us, and after sermon I did walk with them home, and there left them.

1669-04-03 10:04   To the Council of War again: but the proceedings of the Commanders so devilishly bad, and so professedly partial to the Captain, that I could endure it no longer, but took occasion to pretend business at the Office, and away, and Middleton with me, who was of the same mind.

1669-04-02 22:05   This night I did bring home from the King’s potticary’s, in White Hall by Mr. Cooling’s direction, a water that he says did him mighty good for his eyes. I pray God it may do me good; but, by his description, his disease was the same as mine, and this do encourage me to use it.

1669-04-02 22:00   I home; and there find my wife not yet come home from Deptford, where she hath been all this day to see her mother, but she come and by, and so to talk, and supper, and to bed.

1669-04-02 18:40 r Mr. Chevins took me into the back stairs, and they with his friend, Mr. Fowkes, he did make me, with some others that he took in (among others, Alderman Bucknell) eat a pickled herring, the largest I ever saw, and drink variety of wines till I was almost merry.

1669-04-02 17:11 r I did see the young Duchess, a little child in hanging sleeves, dance most finely, so as almost to ravish me, her ears were so good: taught by a Frenchman that did heretofore teach the King, and all the King’s children, and the Queen-Mother herself, who do still dance well.

1669-04-02 16:32 r I did also give the Duke of York a short account of the history of the Navy, as to our Office, wherewith he was very well satisfied: but I do find that he is pretty stiff against their bringing in of men against his mind, as the Treasures were.

1669-04-02 16:05   To the Duke of York’s lodgings, whither he by his appointment come: and alone with him an hour in his closet, telling him mine and W. Coventry’s advice touching the present posture of the Navy, as the Duke of Buckingham and the rest do now labour to make changes therein.

1669-04-02 13:50   With W. Hewer to the Cocke, and there he and I dined alone with great content, he reading to me, for my memory’s sake, my late collections of the history of the Navy, that I might represent the same by and by to the Duke of York.

1669-04-01 17:22   Comes Commissioner Middleton’s coach and horses for us, and we went with it towards the Park, thinking to have met The. Turner and Betty, but did not; so turned back again to their lodging, and there found them and Mr. Batelier, and there, after a little talk, we took leave.

1669-04-01 16:30   Dr. Ball, the Parson of the Temple, did tell me a great many pretty stories about the manner of the Parsons being paid for their preaching at Paul’s heretofore, and now, and the ground of the Lecture, and heretofore the names of the founders thereof, which were many.

1669-04-01 15:10   To Sir W. Pen’s by invitation to dine; where my wife was, and my Lord Brouncker and his mistress, and Sir J. Minnes and his niece; and here a bad dinner, and little mirth, I being little pleased with my host. However, I made myself sociable.

1669-04-01 14:00 r I confess I was pretty high, which did not at least the young gentlemen Commander like; and Middleton did the like. But could not bring it to any issue this day.

1669-04-01 11:20 r But, Lord! to see what wretched doings there were among all the Commanders to ruin the Purser, and defend the Captain in all his rogueries, be it to the prejudice of the King or Purser, no good man could bear!

1669-04-01 09:40   With Colonel Middleton, at the desire of Rear-Admiral Kempthorne, the President, for our assisting them, to the Court-martiall on board a yacht in the River here, to try the business of the Purser’s complaints, Baker against Trevanion, his Commander, of “The Dartmouth.”
