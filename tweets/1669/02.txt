1669-02-28 22:10   I away home; and there spent the evening talking and reading, with my wife and Mr. Pelling, and yet much troubled with my cold, it hardly suffering me to speak, we to bed.

1669-02-28 15:35   With my cozens, to their father’s, where we are kindly received, but he is in great pain for his man Arthur, who, he fears, is now dead, having been desperately sick, and speaks so much of him that my cozen, his wife, and I did make mirth of it, and call him Arthur O’Bradly.

1669-02-28 12:15   To church, where, God forgive me! I did most of the time gaze on the fine milliner’s wife, in Fenchurch Street, who was at our church today; and so home to dinner.

1669-02-28 08:03 r It is to have the Captains to account for all stores and victuals; but upon so silly grounds, to my thinking; and ignorance of the present instructions of Officers, that I am ashamed to hear it. However, I do take a copy of it, for my future use and answering.

1669-02-28 07:55   Up, and got my wife to read to me a copy of what the Surveyor offered to the Duke of York on Friday, he himself putting it into my hands to read; but, Lord! it is a poor, silly thing ever to think to bring it in practice, in the King’s Navy.

1669-02-27 19:00   All the afternoon till night busy at the office again, where forced to speak low and dictate. But that that troubles me most is my eyes, which are still mighty bad night and day.

1669-02-26 16:55 r The emptiness of the house took away our pleasure a great deal, though I liked it the better; for that I plainly discern the music is the better, by how much the house the emptier.

1669-02-26 14:30 r The being of a new play at the other house, I suppose, being the cause, though it be so silly a play that I wonder how there should be enough people to go thither two days together, and not leave more to fill this house.

1669-02-26 13:46   Though I could not speak, yet I went with my wife and girls to the King’s playhouse, to show them that, and there saw “The Faithfull Shepherdesse.” But, Lord! what an empty house, there not being, as I could tell the people, so many as to make up above 10l. in the whole house!

1669-02-26 07:48   Was forced to send my excuse to the Duke of York for my not attending him with my fellows this day because of my cold, and was the less troubled because I was thereby out of the way to offer my proposals about Pursers till the Surveyor hath delivered his notions.

1669-02-25 21:12  To the office I, and did a little business, and so home to supper with my girls, and pretty merry, only my eyes, which continue very bad, and my cold, that I cannot speak at all, do trouble me.

1669-02-25 16:40 r But the silliest for words and design, and everything, that ever I saw in my life, there being nothing pleasing in it, but a good martial dance of pikemen, where Harris and another do handle their pikes in a dance to admiration; but never less satisfied with a play in my life.

1669-02-25 12:52   Home and eat a bit myself, and then followed my wife and girls to the Duke of York’s house, and there before one, but the house infinite full, where, by and by, the King and Court come, it being a new play, or an old one new vamped, by Shadwell, called “The Royall Shepherdesse”.

1669-02-24 22:25 r And so away home to bed, with infinite content at this his treat; for it was mighty pretty, and everything mighty rich.

1669-02-24 20:42   My wife sends for me to W. Hewer’s lodging, where I find two best chambers of his so finely furnished, and all so rich and neat, that I was mightily pleased with him and them and here had a mighty neat dish of custards and tarts, and good drink and talk.

1669-02-24 08:40   Lay long in bed, both being sleepy and my eyes bad, and myself having a great cold so as I was hardly able to speak, but, however, by and by up and to the office.

1669-02-23 23:10   To Mr. Batelier’s, where we supped, and had a good supper, and here was Mr. Gumbleton; and after supper some fiddles, and so to dance; but my eyes were so out of order, that I had little pleasure this night at all, though I was glad to see the rest merry.

1669-02-23 16:32 r And, among others, I had one or two singing-glasses made, which make an echo to the voice, the first that ever I saw; but so thin, that the very breath broke one or two of them.

1669-02-23 15:48 r To the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there, finding the play begun, we homeward to the Glass-House, and there showed my cozens the making of glass, and had several things made with great content.

1669-02-23 14:45 r Here we did see, by particular favour, the body of Queen Katherine of Valois; and I had the upper part of her body in my hands and I did kiss her mouth, reflecting upon it that I did kiss a Queen and that this was my birthday, thirty-six years old, that I did first kiss a Queen.

1669-02-23 14:30 r But I do find them staying at my tailor’s, the play not being today, and therefore I now took them to Westminster Abbey, and there did show them all the tombs very finely, having one with us alone, there being other company this day to see the tombs.

1669-02-23 13:39   To the Office, where all the morning, and then home, and put a mouthfull of victuals in my mouth; and by a hackney-coach followed my wife and the girls, who are gone by eleven o’clock, thinking to have seen a new play at the Duke of York’s house.

1669-02-22 17:50 r After the play done, we met with W. Batelier and W. Hewer and Talbot Pepys, and they follow us in a hackney-coach: and we all stopped at Hercules’ Pillars; and there I did give them the best supper I could, and pretty merry.

1669-02-22 16:30 r But I like no play here so well as at the common playhouse; besides that, my eyes being very ill since last Sunday and this day se’nnight, with the light of the candles, I was in mighty pain to defend myself now from the light of the candles.

1669-02-22 15:50 r I do carry them to White Hall, and there did without much trouble get into the playhouse, there in a good place among the Ladies of Honour, and myself also sat in the pit; and there by and by come the King and Queen, and they begun “Bartholomew Fayre.”

1669-02-22 14:59   I home, and after dinner, with my wife, in her morning-gown, and the two girls dressed, to Unthanke’s, where my wife dresses herself, having her gown this day laced, and a new petticoat; and so is indeed very fine.

1669-02-22 08:42   With Sir H. Cholmly, talking of Tangier matters, wherein I find him troubled from some reports lately from Norwood (who is his great enemy and I doubt an ill man), of some decay of the Mole, and a breach made therein by the sea to a great value.

1669-02-21 20:58   Comes W. Batelier and his sisters and supped and talked with us, and so spent the evening, myself being somewhat out of order because of my eyes, which have never been well since reading at Sir W. Coventry’s chamber.

1669-02-21 18:11   I to my Office, to write down my Journall, and so home to my chamber and to do a little business there, my papers being in mighty disorder, and likely so to continue while these girls are with us.

1669-02-21 13:40   We dined with W. Batelier, and W. Hewer with us, these two girls making it necessary that they be always with us, for I am not company light enough to be always merry with them.

1669-02-20 21:03   Home, and to supper, W. Batelier and W. Hewer with us, and so my cold being great, and greater by my having left my coat at my tailor’s tonight and come home in a thinner that I borrowed there, I went to bed before them.

1669-02-20 18:48 r And thence with them to Mrs. Gotier’s, the Queen’s tire-woman, for a pair of locks for my wife; she is an oldish French woman, but with a pretty hand as most I have seen.

1669-02-20 17:10   After dinner out with my wife and my two girls to the Duke of York’s house, and there saw “The Gratefull Servant,” a pretty good play, and which I have forgot that ever I did see.

1669-02-19 20:50   All the afternoon I at the Office, while the young people went to see Bedlam, and at night home to them and to supper, and pretty merry, only troubled with a great cold at this time, and my eyes very bad ever since Monday night last that the light of the candles spoiled me.

1669-02-19 10:21   I did propose to Sir W. Coventy my putting in to serve in Parliament, if there should be a new one chose: he likes it mightily, both for the King’s and Service’s sake, and will propound it to the Duke of York: and I confess, if there be one, I would be glad to be in.

1669-02-19 09:00   Up, and after seeing the girls, who lodged in our bed, with their maid Martha, who hath been their father’s maid these twenty years and more, I with Lord Brouncker to White Hall, where all of us waited on the Duke of York.

1669-02-18 20:47 r We took Bab. and Betty to our house, where they lay and supped, and pretty merry, and very fine with their new clothes, and good comely girls they are enough, and very glad I am of their being with us, though I would very well have been contented to have been without the charge.

1669-02-18 17:20 r But here who should we have come to us but Bab. and Betty and Talbot, the first play they were yet at; and going to see us, and hearing by my boy, whom I sent to them, that we were here, they come to us hither, and happened all of us to sit by my cozen Turner and The.

1669-02-18 17:00   My wife and I to the Duke of York’s house, to a play, and there saw “The Mad Lover,” which do not please me so well as it used to do, only Betterton’s part still pleases me.

1669-02-17 21:20   I did reckon what I owed W. Batelier; and find that the things my wife hath taken (together with my own which comes not to above 5l.) comes to above 22l. But it is the last and so I am better contented; they are things that are not trifles, but clothes, gloves, shoes, hoods, &c.

1669-02-17 20:32 r I led her to the Great Gate, and there left her, she telling me, of her own accord, that she was going as far as Charing Cross; but my boy was at the gate, and so je durst not go out con her, which vexed me, and my mind (God forgive me) did run apres her toute that night.

1669-02-17 20:14 r I observed she went into the passage towards the Privy Water-Gate, and I followed, but missed her; but coming back I observed she returned. I followed her and took occasion, in the new passage now built, to take her by the hand, to lead her through, which she willingly accepted.

1669-02-17 20:00   To White Hall to meet with Sir W. Coventry, but missed him. But I had a pleasant rencontre of a lady in mourning, that, by the little light I had, seemed handsome. I did observe she looked back again and again upon me, I suffering her to go before, and it being now duske.

1669-02-17 17:59 r At church there was my Lord Brouncker and Mrs. Williams in our pew, the first time they were ever there or that I knew that either of them would go to church.

1669-02-17 17:50   To Colonel Middleton’s house, to the burial of his wife, where we are all invited, and much more company, and had each of us a ring: and so towards evening to our church, where there was a sermon preached by Mills, and so home.

1669-02-16 20:20 r Nevertheless, with the help of my tube, and being desirous of easing my mind of five or six days journall, I did venture to write it down from ever since this day se’nnight, and I think without hurting my eyes any more than they were before, which was very much.

1669-02-16 17:55   To the Office, where busy all the afternoon, though my eyes mighty bad with the light of the candles last night, which was so great as to make my eyes sore all this day, and do teach me, by a manifest experiment, that it is only too much light that do make my eyes sore.

1669-02-16 12:12   Home, where I find some things of W. Batelier’s come out of France, among which some clothes for my wife, wherein she is likely to lead me to the expence of so much money as vexed me. But I was mightily pleased with another picture of the King of France’s head, of Nanteuil’s.

1669-02-15 23:22 r The house very full; and late before done, so that it was past eleven before we got home. But we were well pleased with seeing it, and so to supper, where it happened that there was no bread in the house, which was an unusual case, and so to bed.

1669-02-15 21:32   My wife and I to White Hall; and there did get into the play, the only one we have seen this winter: it was “The Five Hours’ Adventure:” but I sat so far I could not hear well, nor was there any pretty woman that I did see, but my wife, who sat in my Lady Fox’s pew with her.

1669-02-15 15:20   To my cozen Roger’s and find him well again, and his wife merry. Here was also Bab. and Betty, who have not their clothes yet, and therefore cannot go out, otherwise I would have had them abroad tomorrow; but the poor girls mighty kind to us, and we must show them kindness also.

1669-02-15 12:20   I did at my bookseller’s shop accidentally fall into talk with Sir Samuel Tuke about trees, and Mr. Evelyn’s garden; and I do find him, I think, a little conceited, but a man of very fine discourse as any I ever heard almost, which I was mighty glad of.

1669-02-15 12:03   To my cozen Turner’s, where, having been told by her that she had drawn me for her Valentine, I did call at the New Exchange, and bought her a pair of green silk stockings and garters and shoe-strings, and two pair of jessimy gloves, coming to about 28s., and did give them her.

1669-02-15 10:09   To the plaisterer’s, and there saw the figure of my face taken from the mould: and it is most admirably like, and I will have another made, before I take it away.

1669-02-14 14:50 r Sir Thomas Osborne is a beggar, having 11 or 1200l. a-year, but owes above 10,000l. The Duke of Buckingham hath about 19,600l. a-year, of which he pays away about 7,000l. a-year in interest, about 2000l. in fee-farm rents to the King, and about 6000l. wages and pensions.

1669-02-14 14:42 r I with Mr. Wren to his chamber to talk; where he observed, that these people are all of them a broken sort of people, that have not much to lose, and therefore will venture all to make their fortunes better.

1669-02-14 14:15 r The Duke of York did carry me to the King, and I did satisfy him also; but his satisfaction is nothing worth, it being easily got, and easily removed; but I do purpose to put in writing that which shall make the Treasurers ashamed. The Duke of York is horrid angry against them.

1669-02-14 13:30   To White Hall, where the Duke of York expected me; and in his closet Wren and I. He did tell me how the King hath been acquainted with the Treasurers’ discourse at the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and is dissatisfied with our running him in debt, which I removed.

1669-02-14 12:02 r He did show me two or three old books of the Navy, of my Lord Northumberland’s times, which he hath taken many good notes out of, for justifying the Duke of York and us, in many things, wherein, perhaps, precedents will be necessary to produce, which did give me great content.

1669-02-14 11:45   I with Sir W. Coventry all the morning, full of very good discourse of the Navy and public matters, to my great content, wherein I find him doubtful that all will be bad, and, for his part, he tells me he takes no more care for any thing more than in the Treasury.

1669-02-13 22:10   Up, and all the morning at the office, and at noon home to dinner, and thence to the office again mighty busy, to my great content, till night, and then home to supper and, my eyes being weary, to bed.

1669-02-12 21:00   Home, and there Pelling hath got me W. Pen’s book against the Trinity. I got my wife to read it to me; and I find it so well writ as, I think, it is too good for him ever to have writ it; and it is a serious sort of book, and not fit for every body to read.

1669-02-12 19:14   I homeward, and calling my wife called at my cozen Turner’s, and there met our new cozen Pepys (Mrs. Dickenson), and Bab. and Betty come yesterday to town, poor girls, whom we have reason to love, and mighty glad we are to see them.

1669-02-12 16:00   The Duke of York is mighty desirous to bring in as many good motions of profit and reformation in the Navy as he can. To my great joy he is mighty open to me in every thing; and by this means I know his whole mind, and shall be able to secure myself, if he stands.

1669-02-12 13:05 r And so away vexed, and called my wife, and to Hercules Pillars, Tom and I, there dined; and here there coming a Frenchman by with his Shew, we did make him show it us, which he did just as Lacy acts it, which made it mighty pleasant to me.

1669-02-12 11:15 r To the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and there had a hot debate against Sir W. Coventry and Sir J. Duncomb, who did uphold our Office against an accusation of our Treasurers, who told the Lords that they found that we had run the King in debt 50,000l. or more.

1669-02-12 09:50 r Here we showed him Sir J. Minnes’s propositions about balancing Storekeeper’s accounts; and I did show him Hosier’s, which did please him mightily, and he will have it showed the Council and King anon, to be put in practice.

1669-02-12 09:20   The Duke of York did tell us that the King would have us prepare a draught of the administration of the Navy, and what it was in the late times, in order to his being able to distinguish between the good and the bad, which I shall do, but to do it well will give me trouble.

1669-02-11 17:55   To work all the afternoon with great pleasure, and did bring my business to a very little compass in my day book, which is a mighty pleasure.

1669-02-10 20:03   Home, and find Povy and W. Batelier, by appointment, to talk of some merchandize of wine and linen; but I do not like of their troubling my house to meet in, having no mind to their pretences of having their rendezvous here, but I was not much troubled, but went to the office.

1669-02-10 15:25 r After dinner, I did what I went for, which was to get the Duke’s consent that Balty might hold his Muster-Master’s place by deputy, in his new employment which I design for him, about the Storekeeper’s accounts; which the Duke of York did grant me, and I was mighty glad of it.

1669-02-10 14:28 r And then the Duke did now mightily commend some new sort of wine lately found out, called Navarre wine, which I tasted, and is, I think, good wine: but I did like better the notion of the sauce, and by and by did taste it, and liked it mightily.

1669-02-10 14:20 r The Duke dined and did mightily magnify his sauce, which he did then eat with every thing and said it was the best universal sauce in the world, it being taught him by the Spanish Embassador; made of some parsley and a dry toast, together with vinegar, salt, and a little pepper.

1669-02-10 14:03   The Duke of York did tell me that tomorrow was to be the great day that the business of the Navy would be discoursed of before the King and his Caball, and that he must stand on his guard, and did design to have had me in readiness by.

1669-02-10 13:03   I sent to Mr. Spong to come to me to Hercules Pillars, and there did bring with him my new Parallelogram of brass, which I was mightily pleased with, and paid for it 25s., and am mightily pleased with his ingenious and modest company.

1669-02-10 10:20 r Thus was the mould made; but when it came off there was little pleasure in it, as it looks in the mould, nor any resemblance whatever there will be in the figure, when I come to see it cast off, which I am to call for a day or two hence, which I shall long to see.

1669-02-10 09:53 r And by and by, by degrees, how hard the plaister becomes, that you cannot break it, and sits so close, that you cannot pull it off, and yet so easy, that it is as soft as a pillow, so safe is everything where many parts of the body do bear alike.

1669-02-10 09:50   With my wife to the plaisterer’s at Charing Cross, that casts heads and bodies in plaister: and there I had my whole face done; but I was vexed first to be forced to daub all my face over with pomatum: but it was pretty to feel how soft and easily it is done on the face.

1669-02-09 22:10   To bed, my mind being mightily eased by my having this morning delivered to the Office a letter about our answers to the Commissioners of Accounts, whom we have neglected, and I have done this as a record in my justification hereafter, when it shall come to be examined.

1669-02-09 17:00   Abroad with my wife to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Island Princesse,” which I like mighty well, as an excellent play: and here we find Kinaston to be well enough to act again, which he do very well, after his beating by Sir Charles Sedley’s appointment.

1669-02-08 20:20   Dispatched a great deal of business at the office, and there pretty late, till finding myself very full of wind, by my eating no dinner today, being vexed, I was forced to go home.

1669-02-08 14:40 r But at last did call up Jane, and confirm her mistress’s directions for her being gone at Easter, which I find the wench willing to be, but directly prayed that Tom might go with her, which I promised.

1669-02-08 14:02   My wife in a wonderful ill humour and, after dinner, I staid with her, being not able to endure this life, and fell to some angry words; by and by were good friends, she telling me it was about Jane, whom she cannot believe but I am base with, which I made a matter of mirth at.

1669-02-08 11:49   Took my wife up at Unthank’s, and in our way home did show her the tall woman in Holborne, which I have seen before; and I measured her, and she is, without shoes, just six feet five inches high, and they say not above twenty-one years old.

1669-02-08 10:55   I met with Mr. Moore, who tells me the state of my Lord’s accounts of his embassy, which I find not so good as I thought: for, though it be passed the King and his Cabal (the Committee for Foreign Affairs as they are called), yet they have cut off from 9000l. full 8000l.

1669-02-08 10:00   I to visit my Lord Sandwich; and there did see a young Spaniard, that he hath brought over with him, dance, which he is admired for, as the best dancer in Spain, and indeed he do with mastery; but I do not like his dancing as the English, though my Lord commends it mightily.

1669-02-08 09:10   Going to visit Roger Pepys, at the potticary’s, he tells me that Roger is gone to his wife’s, so that they have been married ever since the middle of last week: it was his design, upon good reasons, to make no noise of it; but I am well enough contented that it is over.

1669-02-08 08:30   By coach, to White Hall; and in the way, our little boy, at Martin, my bookseller’s shop, going to ’light, did fall down; and, had he not been a most nimble boy (I saw how he did it, and was mightily pleased with him for it), he had been run over by the coach.

1669-02-07 22:03 r And did this night by chance the first time poner my digito en her thing, which did do her much pleasure; but I pray God that ella doth not think that yo did know before – or get a trick of liking it. So para sleep.

1669-02-07 22:00 r At last, I did give her such satisfaction, that we were mighty good friends, and went to bed betimes, where yo did hazer very well con her.

1669-02-07 20:25 r Which was so far from truth that I could not be troubled, though I could not wonder at her being troubled if she had these thoughts, and therefore she would lie from me, and caused sheets to be put on in the blue room, and would have Jane lie with her lest I should come to her.

1669-02-07 20:15 r It was, that she did believe me false to her with Jane, and did rip up three or four silly circumstances of her not rising till I come out of my chamber, and her letting me thereby see her dressing herself; and that I must needs go into her chamber and was naught with her.

1669-02-07 19:50 r But at last she did, where I found her crying on the ground, and I could not please her; but I did at last find that she did plainly expound it to me.

1669-02-07 19:12 r To church, and so home to dinner, where my wife in a worse fit, which lasted all the afternoon, and shut herself up, in her closet, and I mightily grieved and vexed, and could not get her to tell me what ayled her, or to let me into her closet.

1669-02-07 07:30   My wife mighty peevish in the morning about my lying unquietly a-nights, and she will have it that it is a late practice, from my evil thoughts in my dreams she doth lay her hand upon my cockerel to observe what she can, and mightily she is troubled about it; but all blew over.

1669-02-06 18:19 r Thence home, and just at Holborn Conduit the bolt broke, that holds the fore-wheels to the perch, and so the horses went away with them, and left the coachman and us; but being near our coachmaker’s, we were presently supplied with another, and so home.

1669-02-06 17:20   To the King’s playhouse, and there did see “The Moor of Venice:” but ill acted in most parts; Mohun not acting Iago’s part by much so well as Clun used to do; nor another Hart’s, which was Cassio’s; nor, indeed, Burt doing the Moor’s so well as I once thought he did.

1669-02-05 10:45   Home, calling in two or three places — among others, Dancre’s, where I find him beginning of a piece for me, of Greenwich, which will please me well.

1669-02-05 08:01   With Sir W. Coventry to White Hall, and there walked in the garden, and by my visit to keep fresh my interest in him; and there he tells me how it hath been talked that he was to go one of the Commissioners to Ireland, which he was resolved never to do, unless directly commanded.

1669-02-04 16:11 r Out with my wife and Mr. Gibson to an instrument-maker’s shop in Chancery Lane, that was once a ‘Prentice of Greatorex’s, but the master was not within, and there he showed me a Parallelogram in brass, which I like so well that I will buy and bid it be made clean and fit for me.

1669-02-04 14:32 r I did call Mr. Gibson to take notice of it, who is very much pleased therewith; and it seems this Parallelogram is not, as Mr. Sheres would have persuaded me, the same as a Protractor, which do so much the more make me value it, but of itself it is a most usefull instrument.

1669-02-04 13:50   Home with my people to dinner, and then after dinner comes Mr. Spong to see me, and brings me my Parallelogram, in better order than before, and two or three draughts of the port of Brest, to my great content.

1669-02-03 22:15   I finding this day that I may be able to do a great deal of business by dictating, if I do not read myself, or write, without spoiling my eyes, I being very well in my eyes after a great day’s work.

1669-02-03 22:04   To the Office till noon, and then home to a little dinner, and thither again till night, mighty busy, to my great content, doing a great deal of business, and so home to supper, and to bed.

1669-02-03 07:12 r I did, with much difficulty, pacify her, and were friends, she desiring that hereafter, at that house, we might always sit either above in a box, or, if there be room, close up to the lower boxes.

1669-02-03 06:40   To supper and to bed, my wife being in mighty ill humour all night, and in the morning I found it to be from her observing Knepp to wink and smile on me; and she says I smiled on her; and, poor wretch! I did perceive that she did, and do on all such occasions, mind my eyes.

1669-02-02 18:32   To White Hall, and there I stepped in, and looked out Mr. May, who tells me that he and his company cannot come to dine with me tomorrow, whom I expected only to come to see the manner of our Office and books, at which I was not displeased, having much business at the Office.

1669-02-02 17:12 r But it was pleasant to see Beeston supposing it to be dark, and yet he is forced to read his part by the light of the candles. But that that pleased me most in the play is, the first song that Knepp sings; and, indeed, it was finely sung, so as to make the whole house clap her.

1669-02-02 17:02 r His part is done by Beeston, who is fain to read it out of a book, and thereby spoils the part, and almost the play, it being one of the best parts in it; and though the design is pretty good, yet it is but an indifferent play, wrote, they say, by my Lord Newcastle.

1669-02-02 14:20 r To the King’s playhouse, where “The Heyresse,” not-withstanding Kinaston’s being beaten, is acted; and they say the King is very angry with Sir Charles Sedley for his being beaten, but he do deny it.

1669-02-01 14:30   To the King’s playhouse, thinking to have seen “The Heyresse”; but we find no play; Kinaston, that did act a part therein, in abuse to Sir Charles Sedley, being last night exceedingly beaten with sticks, by two or three that assaulted him, so as he is mightily bruised.

1669-02-01 11:50 r To my Lord Bellassis to see a chimney-piece of Dancre’s doing in distemper, with egg to keep off the glaring of the light, which I must have done: it is pretty but I do think it is not altogether so beautiful as the oyle pictures; but I will have some of one and some of another.

1669-02-01 11:07 r There I found him, and Dr. Wren, and several Virtuosos, looking upon the paintings which he is making for the new Theatre at Oxford: they look as if they would be fine, and the rest think better than those of Rubens in the Banqueting-house at White Hall, but I do not think so.

1669-02-01 10:40 r Mr. Povy carried me to Mr. Streeter’s, the famous history-painter over the way, whom I have often heard of, but did never see him before.

1669-02-01 09:55 r I went to a Committee of Tangier, but it did not meet, and so I meeting Mr. Povy, he and I away to Dancre’s, to speak something touching the pictures I am getting him to make for me.

1669-02-01 08:45   Up, and by water from the Tower to White Hall, the first time that I have gone to that end of the town by water, for two or three months, I think, since I kept a coach, which God send propitious to me; but it is a very great convenience.
