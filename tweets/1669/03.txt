1669-03-25 00:46 r With a lanthorn from thence walked over the fields, as dark as pitch, and mighty cold, and snow, to Chatham, and Mr. Coney with great kindness to me: and there all in bed before I come home, and so I presently to bed.

1669-03-24 23:40 r Here mightily pleased with Mrs. Jowles, and did get her to the street door, and there tocar su breasts, and besar her without any force, and creo that I might have had all else, but it was not time nor place.

1669-03-24 22:30 r And yo do not at all doubt that I might have had that that I would have desired de ella had I had time to have carried her to Cobham, as she, upon my proposing it, was very willing to go, for ella is a whore, that is certain, but a very brave and comely one.

1669-03-24 21:50 r I had the liberty to salute her often, and pull off her glove, where her hand mighty moist, and she mighty free in kindness to me.

1669-03-24 20:30 r Here was also a gentleman, one Major Manly, and his wife, neighbours; and here we staid, and drank, and talked, and set Coney and him to play while Mrs. Jowles and I to talk, and there had all our old stories up.

1669-03-24 18:04 r Stopped again at Captain Allen’s, and there ’light, and sent the coach and Gibson home, and I and Coney staid; and there comes to us Mrs. Jowles, who is a very fine, proper lady, as most I know, and well dressed.

1669-03-24 16:50 r In our way back, I ’light to see a Saxon monument of a King, which is three stones standing upright, and a great round one lying on them, of great bigness, although not so big as those on Salisbury Plain; but certainly it is a thing of great antiquity.

1669-03-24 14:40 r We to our inne to dinner, and had a good dinner; and after dinner a barber come to me, and there trimmed me, that I might be clean against night, to go to Mrs. Allen.

1669-03-24 11:14 r : and in the town did see an old man beating of flax, and did step into the barn and give him money, and saw that piece of husbandry which I never saw, and it is very pretty: in the street also I did buy and send to our inne, the Bell, a dish of fresh fish.

1669-03-24 11:14 r To Maydstone, which I had a mighty mind to see, having never been there; and walked all up and down the town, and up to the top of the steeple, and had a noble view, and then down again.

1669-03-24 10:20 r Had the pleasure of seeing the Medway running, winding up and down mightily, and a very fine country; and I had a sight of Sir John Bankes’ seat and house, which is an old abbey just like Hinchingbroke, and as good at least, and mighty finely placed by the river.

1669-03-24 08:50 r Took occasion at St. Margett’s, to pretend to call to see Captain Allen to see whether Mrs. Jowles, his daughter, was there; and there his wife come to the door, he being at London, and through a window, I spied Jowles, but took no notice of her but made excuse till night.

1669-03-24 08:12   To the Hill-House, and there did give order for the coach to be made ready; and got Mr. Gibson, whom I carried with me, to go with me and Mr. Coney, the surgeon, towards Maydston which I had a mighty mind to see.

1669-03-23 22:10   After supper, we fell to talk of spirits and apparitions, whereupon many pretty, particular stories were told, so as to make me almost afeard to lie alone, but for shame I could not help it; and so to bed and, being sleepy, fell soon to rest.

1669-03-23 18:20   We got to Chatham just at night, with very good discourse by the way, but mostly of matters of religion, wherein Huchinson his vein lies.

1669-03-23 14:00   I took coach with Commissioner Middleton, Captain Tinker, and Mr. Huchinson, a hackney coach, and over the bridge, and so out towards Chatham, and; dined at Dartford, where we staid an hour or two, it being a cold day.

1669-03-22 21:10 r And so away home, where my wife troubled at my being so late abroad, poor woman! though never more busy, but I satisfied her; and so begun to put things in order for my journey tomorrow, and so, after supper, to bed.

1669-03-22 20:24 r Which I did the rather, that I might be out of the way at the wedding, and be at a little liberty myself for a day, or two, to find a little pleasure, and give my eyes a little ease.  The Duke of York mightily satisfied with it.

1669-03-22 20:20   My eyes mighty bad with this day’s work, I up to the Duke of York, and there did propound to him my going to Chatham tomorrow with Commissioner Middleton, and so this week to make the pay there, and examine the business of “The Defyance” being lost, and other businesses.

1669-03-22 13:35   To the Cocke, where there was no room, and thence to King Street, to several cook’s shops, where nothing to be had; and at last to the corner shop, going down Ivy Lane, by my Lord of Salisbury’s, and there got a good dinner, my wife, and W. Hewer, and I.

1669-03-22 12:03 r At it till noon, here being several of my brethren with me but doing nothing, but I all.

1669-03-22 11:40   To the Treasury-Chamber, and there all the morning to my great grief, put to do Sir G. Downing’s work of dividing the Customes for this year, between the Navy, the Ordnance and Tangier: but it did so trouble my eyes, that I had rather have given 20l. than have had it to do.

1669-03-22 09:20 r He showed me a list of all his friends that he must this week make visits to, that come to visit him in the Tower; and seems mighty well satisfied with his being out of business, but I do believe that all must go to rat if the King do not come to see the want of such a servant.

1669-03-22 09:06 r At least, he hath not yet leave to come, nor hath thought fit to ask it, hearing that Henry Saville is not only denied to kiss the King’s hand, but the King, being asked it by the Duke of York, did deny it, and directed that the Duke shall not receive him.

1669-03-22 08:55   I did make a step to see Sir W. Coventry at his house, where, I bless God! he is come again; but in my way I met him, and so he took me into his coach and carried me to White Hall, and there set me down where he ought not.

1669-03-21 20:40   To supper, where Pelling comes to see and sup with us, and I find that he is assisting my wife in getting a licence to our young people to be married this Lent, which is resolved shall be done upon Friday next, my great day, or feast, for my being cut of the stone.

1669-03-21 19:10   News is lately come of the Algerines taking 3000l. in money, out of one of our Company’s East India ships, outward bound, which will certainly make the war last; which I am sorry for, being so poor as we are, and broken in pieces.

1669-03-21 14:20   After dinner W. Howe propounds to me my lending him 500l., to help him to purchase a place — the Master of the Patent Office, of Sir Richard Piggott. I did give him a civil answer, but shall think twice of it; and the more, because of the changes we are like to have in the Navy.

1669-03-21 10:14 r But he tells me that the King is kind to him, and hath promised him a pension of 300l. a-year out of the Works; which will be of more content to him than the place, which, under their present wants of money, is a place that disobliges most people.

1669-03-21 10:03   Met with Mr. May, who tells me the story of his being put by Sir John Denham’s place, of Surveyor of the King’s Works, who it seems, is lately dead, by the unkindness of the Duke Buckingham, who hath brought in Dr. Wren: which is an ill thing.

1669-03-21 08:40   Up, and by water over to Southwarke; and then, not getting a boat, I forced to walk to Stangate; and so over to White Hall, in a scull; where up to the Duke of York’s dressing-room, and there met Harry Saville, and understand that Sir W. Coventry is come to his house last night.

1669-03-20 21:00   Home, mightily pleased with the news brought me, that the King and Duke of York are come back this afternoon, and no sooner come, but a warrant was sent to the Tower for the releasing Sir W. Coventry.

1669-03-20 09:44 r But he found himself soon deceived of the Parliament, they having a long time before his removal been cloyed with his speeches and good words, and were come to hate him.

1669-03-20 09:42 r But then he told me that, a great deal before the war, my Lord Chancellor did speak of a war with some heat, as a thing to be desired, and did it upon a belief that he could with his speeches make the Parliament give what money he pleased, and do what he would.

1669-03-20 09:18 r That they were against the war at first, declaring, as wise men and statesmen, that they thought it fit to have a war with them at some time, but that it ought not to be till we found the Crowns of Spain and France together by the eares, the want of which did ruin our war.

1669-03-20 09:15   To the Tower, to W. Coventry, and there walked with him alone, on the Stone Walk, till company come to him; and there about the business of the Navy discoursed with him, and about my Lord Chancellor and Treasurer.

1669-03-19 20:20   Mr. Wren  tells me, as a secret, that last night the Duke of York’s closet was broken open, and his cabinets, and shut again, one of them that the rogue that did it hath left plate and a watch behind him, and therefore they fear that it was only for papers.

1669-03-19 15:28 r The other cause was of the loss of “The Providence” at Tangier, where the Captain’s being by chance on shore may prove very inconvenient to him, though the man be a good man, and one whom I would be kind to; but I will not offer any thing to the excusing such a miscarriage.

1669-03-19 14:45 r Here was tried a difference between Sir L. Van Hemskirke, the Dutch Captain who commands “The Nonsuch,” built by his direction, and his Lieutenant; a drunken kind of silly business. We ordered the Lieutenant to ask him pardon.

1669-03-19 14:00   With Commissioner Middleton and Kempthorne to a Court-martiall, to which, by virtue of my late Captainship, I am called, the first I was ever at; where many Commanders, and Kempthorne president.

1669-03-19 10:48   To the plaisterer’s, and took my face, and my Lord Duke of Albemarle’s, home with me by coach, they being done to my mind; and mighty glad I am of understanding this way of having the pictures of any friends.

1669-03-19 09:02   Sir Thomas Clifford did speak to me, as desirous that I would some time confer with him about the Navy, which I am glad of, but will take the direction of the Duke of York before I do it, though I would be glad to do something to secure myself, if I could, in my employment.

1669-03-18 22:20   Home, and to the office, where busy late, and so home to supper and to bed, with great content, but much business in my head of the office, which troubles me.

1669-03-18 18:30   To Hyde Park, the first time we were there this year, or ever in our own coach, where with mighty pride rode up and down, and many coaches there; and I thought our horses and coach as pretty as any there, and observed so to be by others.

1669-03-18 15:55   To visit Ned Pickering and his lady, and Creed and his wife, but the former abroad, and the latter out of town, gone to my Lady Pickering’s in Northamptonshire, upon occasion of the late death of their brother, Oliver Pickering, a youth, that is dead of the smallpox.

1669-03-18 14:22 r She is a mighty proper maid, and pretty comely, but so so; but hath a most pleasing tone of voice, and speaks handsomely, but hath most great hands, and I believe ugly; but very well dressed, and good clothes, and the maid I believe will please me well enough.

1669-03-18 14:20 r I therefore longed to see the maid, but did not till after dinner, that my wife and I going by coach, she went with us to Holborne, where we set her down.

1669-03-18 13:09   Home to dinner, where my wife mighty finely dressed, by a maid that she hath taken, and is to come to her when Jane goes; and the same she the other day told me of, to be so handsome.

1669-03-18 11:50   To see Sir W. Coventry, and walked with him a good while in the Stone Walk: and brave discourse about my Lord Chancellor, and his ill managements and mistakes, and several things of the Navy, and thence to the office, where we sat all the morning.

1669-03-17 17:20   To the Exchequer, and after a little business did go by water home, and there dined, and took my wife by a hackney to the King’s playhouse, and saw “The Coxcomb,” the first time acted, but an old play, and a silly one, being acted only by the young people.

1669-03-17 10:10   Doll Lane is brought to bed at her sister’s lodging, and gives it out that she is married, but there is no such thing certainly, she never mentioning it, but I have cause to rejoice that I have not seen her a great while, she having desired my company but I doubt to an evil end.

1669-03-17 08:34   Up, and by water to see Mr. Wren, and then Mr. Williamson, who did show me the very original bookes of propositions made by the Commissioners for the Navy, in 1618, to my great content; but no other Navy papers he could now show me.

1669-03-16 21:52 r I find by him that the Bishops must certainly fall, and their hierarchy; these people have got so much ground upon the King and kingdom as is not to be got again from them: and the Bishops do well deserve it.

1669-03-16 21:20   W. Hewer fetched his uncle Blackburne to me, to discourse of the Navy in the late times; and he did do it, by giving me a most exact account of the several turns in the Admiralty and Navy, from the beginning of the King’s leaving the Parliament, to his Son’s coming in.

1669-03-16 17:10 r I to Greenwich by water, and there landed at the King’s house, which goes on slow, but is very pretty. I to the Park, there to see the prospect of the hill, to judge of Dancre’s picture, which he hath made thereof for me: and I do like it very well and it is a very pretty place.

1669-03-16 16:34 r This I did; and upon the whole do find that the late times, in all their management, were not more husbandly than we; and other things of good content to me.

1669-03-16 15:48 r But my business was to speak with Ackworth, about some old things and passages in the Navy, for my information therein, in order to my great business now of stating the history of the Navy.

1669-03-16 15:10   I away down by water with W. Hewer to Woolwich, where I have not been I think more than a year or two, and here I saw, but did not go on board, my ship “The Jerzy,” she lying at the wharf under repair.

1669-03-16 13:14   Comes to me Mr. Evelyn of Deptford, a worthy good man, and dined with me, but a bad dinner; who is grieved for, and speaks openly to me his thoughts of the times, and our ruin approaching; and all by the folly of the King.

1669-03-16 12:04   Home, where my wife and Jane gone abroad, and Tom, in order to their buying of things for their wedding, which, upon my discourse the last night, is now resolved to be done, upon the 26th of this month, the day of my solemnity for my cutting of the stone.

1669-03-15 18:20   I to speak with Mr. Williamson, that if he hath any papers relating to the Navy I might see them. And so home with great content for what I have this day found, having got as much as I desire of the history of the Navy, from 1618 to 1642, when the King and Parliament fell out.

1669-03-15 14:10   W. Hewer and I did walk to the Cocke, at the end of Suffolke Streete, a great ordinary, mightily cried up, and bespoke a pullett which while dressing, he and I walked into St. James’s Park, and thence back, and dined very handsome, with a good soup, and a pullet, for 4s. 6d.

1669-03-15 12:34 r It was great pleasure to me to see the method wherein their rolls are kept; that when the Master of the Office, one Mr. Case, do call for them, who is a man that I have heretofore known by coming to my Lord of Sandwich’s, he did most readily turn to them.

1669-03-15 12:30   With W. Hewer to the Rolls, where I made inquiry for several rolls, and was informed in the manner of it: and spent the whole morning with W. Hewer, he taking little notes in short-hand, while I hired a clerk to read to me about twelve or more several rolls which I did call for.

1669-03-14 22:12   Before I went from my office this night I did tell Tom my resolution not to keep him after Jane was gone, but shall do well by him, which pleases him; and I think he will presently marry her, and go away out of my house with her.

1669-03-14 22:10   I to write down my Journall for the last week, my eyes being very bad, and therefore I forced to find a way to use by turns with my tube, one after another, and so home to supper and to bed.

1669-03-14 17:03   Took coach to visit my cozen Turner, and I out with her to make a visit, but the lady she went to see was abroad. So back and to talk with her and her daughters, and then home, and she and I to walk in the garden, the first time this year, the weather being mighty temperate.

1669-03-14 09:10   With my wife to church, where I did see my milliner’s wife come again, which pleased me; but I durst not be seen to mind her for fear of my wife’s seeing me, though the woman I did never speak twenty words to, and that but only in her husband’s shop.

1669-03-14 08:40   Up, and to my office with Tom, whom I made to read to me the books of Propositions in the time of the Grand Commission, which I did read a good part of before church.

1669-03-13 19:24 r Which do give me occasion of much mirth, and may be of some use to me, at least I shall get a little money by it for the time I have it; it being designed that I must really be a Captain to be able to sit in this Court.

1669-03-13 19:20   But that which put me in good humour, is the fancy that I am this day made a Captain of one of the King’s ships, Mr. Wren having sent me the Duke of York’s commission to be Captain of “The Jerzy” in order to my being of a Court-martiall for examining the loss of “The Defyance.”

1669-03-13 18:45 r However, I had done my business before they come, and so was in good humour enough to be with them, and so home to them to supper, and pretty merry, being pleased to see Betty Turner, which hath something mighty pretty.

1669-03-13 18:30   To the Office again, and there all the afternoon, when comes, by mistake, my cozen Turner, and her two daughters, which love such freaks, to eat some anchovies and ham of bacon with me, instead of noon, at dinner, when I expected them.

1669-03-12 21:30 r But in her fit she did tell me what vexed, that this had put her upon putting off her handsome maid and hiring another that was full of the small pox, which did mightily vex me, though I said nothing.

1669-03-12 21:25 r I did at last bring my wife to very good and kind terms, poor heart! and I was heartily glad of it, for I do see there is no man can be happier than myself, if I will, with her.

1669-03-12 20:53 r But, God knows, I know nothing of Deb., nor what she do, nor what becomes of her, though God knows that my devil that is within me do wish that I could.

1669-03-12 20:48   Home, where, thinking to meet my wife with content, I find her in her closet, alone, in the dark, in a hot fit of railing against me, upon some news she has this day heard of Deb.’s living very fine, and with black spots, and speaking ill words of her mistress.

1669-03-12 20:20   W. Hewer and I to the Crowne Offices where we met with several good things that I most wanted, and did take short notes of the dockets, and so back to the Patent Office, and did the like there, and by candle-light ended.

1669-03-12 14:20   To Gray’s Inn and, at the next door, at a cook’s-shop of Howe’s acquaintance, we bespoke dinner, it being now two o’clock; and in the meantime he carried us into Gray’s Inn, to his chamber, where I never was before; and it is very pretty, and little, and neat, as he was always.

1669-03-12 12:50   To Nott’s, the famous bookbinder, that bound for my Lord Chancellor’s library; and here I did take occasion for curiosity to bespeak a book to be bound, only that I might have one of his binding.

1669-03-12 12:04   To Auditor Beale’s house, and thence with W. Hewer to his Office, and there with great content spent all the morning looking over the Navy accounts of several years, and the several patents of the Treasurers, which was more than I did hope to have found there.

1669-03-11 22:20 r But many times she took occasion to discourse of her handsomeness, and the danger she was in by taking her. But I did assure her of my resolutions to have nothing to do with her maids, but in myself I was glad to have the content to have a handsome one to look on.

1669-03-11 22:03   To supper with my wife, and so to bed, she pleasing me, though I dare not own it, that she hath hired a chambermaid; but she, after many commendations, told me that she had one great fault, and that was, that she was very handsome, at which I made nothing, but let her go on.

1669-03-11 10:12 r We to the Stone Walk, called my Lord of Northumberland’s walk, being paved by some of that title that was prisoner there: and at the end of it there is a piece of iron upon the wall with his armes upon it, and holes to put in a peg for every turn that they make upon that walk.

1669-03-11 10:02   To Sir W. Coventry, to the Tower, where I walked and talked with him an hour alone, from one good thing to another: who tells me that he hears that the Commission is gone down to the King, with a blank to fill, for his place in the Treasury.

1669-03-10 19:40   We out to White Chapel to take a little ayre, though yet the dirtiness of the road do prevent most of the pleasure, which should have been from this tour.

1669-03-10 18:32   To the Privy Seale at White Hall, where, with W. Hewer and Mr. Gibson, I spent the afternoon till evening looking over the books there, and did find several things to my purpose, though few of those I designed to find, the books being kept there in no method at all.

1669-03-10 13:22 r There comes a companion of theirs, Colonel Vernon, I think they called him; a merry good fellow, and one that was very plain in cursing the Duke of Buckingham, and discoursing of his designs to ruin us, and that ruin must follow his counsels, and that we are an undone people.

1669-03-10 12:45   To Westminster, where, at the Exchequer, I met with Mr. Newport and Major Halsey; and, after doing a little business with Mr. Burges, we by water to White Hall, where I made a stop: and so with them by coach to Temple Bar, where, at the Sugar Loaf we dined, and W. Hewer with me.

1669-03-09 19:52 r Here, which I never did before, I drank a glass, of a pint, at one draught, of the juice of oranges, of whose peel they make comfits; and here they drink the juice as wine, with sugar, and it is very fine drink; but, it being new, I was doubtful whether it might not do me hurt.

1669-03-09 19:20   To my cozen Stradwick’s, where I have not been ever since my brother Tom died, there being some difference between my father and them, upon the account of my cozen Scott; and I was glad of this opportunity of seeing them, they being good and substantial people, and kind.

1669-03-09 18:32   To my cozen Turner’s again, and there find my Lady Mordaunt, and her sister Johnson; and by and by comes in a gentleman, Mr. Overbury, a pleasant man, who plays most excellently on the flagelette, a little one, that sounded as low as one of mine, and mighty pretty.

1669-03-09 17:10   My wife and I towards the King’s playhouse, and by the way found Betty, and Bab., and Betty Pepys staying for us; and so took them all to see “Claricilla,” which do not please me almost at all, though there are some good things in it.

1669-03-09 10:03 r Sir W. Coventry showed me the petition he had sent to the King by my Lord Keeper, which was not to desire any admittance to employment, but submitting himself therein humbly to his Majesty; but prayed the removal of his displeasure, and that he might be set free.

1669-03-09 09:10   To the Tower and find Sir W. Coventry writing down his journal which he now keeps of the material things; upon which I told him, and he is the only man I told it to, that I kept it most strictly these eight or ten years; and I am sorry that I told it him, it not being necessary.

1669-03-08 20:40   With my wife alone to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Mocke Astrologer,” which I have often seen, and but an ordinary play; and then home, and there my wife to read to me, my eyes being sensibly hurt by the too great lights of the playhouse.

1669-03-08 09:58   Mr. Moore tells me that Mr. Shepley is upon being turned away from my Lord’s family, and another sent down, which I am sorry for; but his age and good fellowship have almost made him fit for nothing.

1669-03-08 09:00   To the Privy Seal Office, to examine what records I could find, for my help in the business I am put upon, of defending the present constitution of the Navy; but there could not have liberty without order from him that is in present waiting, Mr. Bickerstaffe, who is out of town.

1669-03-08 07:09   With W. Hewer by hackney coach to White Hall where the King and the Duke of York is gone by three in the morning, and had the misfortune to be overset with the Duke of York, the Duke of Monmouth, and the Prince, at the King’s Gate in Holborne; and the King all dirty but no hurt.

1669-03-07 11:55   I hear that tomorrow the King and the Duke of York set out for Newmarket, by three in the morning; to some foot and horse-races, to be abroad ten or twelve days.

1669-03-07 11:20   I perceive all the world is against the Duke of Buckingham his acting thus high, and do prophesy nothing but ruin from it. But he do observe that the church lands cannot certainly come to much, if the King shall be persuaded to take them; they being leased out for long leases.

1669-03-07 11:00 r They rose, having resolved upon sending six ships to the Streights, not being contented with the peace upon the terms they demand, which are, that all our ships, where any Turks or Moores shall be found slaves, shall be prizes; which will imply that they, must be searched.

1669-03-07 09:02   I to White Hall, and there hear that there are letters come from Sir Thomas Allen, that he hath made some kind of peace with Algiers; upon which the King and Duke of York, being to go out of town tomorrow, are met at my Lord Arlington’s, so I there.

1669-03-07 08:13   To the Tower, to see Sir W. Coventry, who had H. Jermin and a great many more with him; I do hear that there was not less than sixty coaches there yesterday, and the other day; which I hear also that there is a great exception taken at, by the King and the Duke of Buckingham.

1669-03-06 21:30   My wife made it appear to me that my late entertainment this week cost me above 12l., an expence which I am almost ashamed of, though it is but once in a great while, and is the end for which, in the most part, we live, to have such a merry day once or twice in a man’s life.

1669-03-06 09:50 r He repeated to me many examples of challenging of Privy-Councillors and others. He tells me of his being weary of the Treasury, and of the folly, ambition, and desire of popularity of Sir Thomas Clifford; and yet the rudeness of his tongue and passions when angry.

1669-03-06 09:30 r And he is to be in one of them as master, and Sir J. Duncomb in the other, as his man or imitator: and their discourse in those tables, about the disposing of their books and papers, very foolish.

1669-03-06 09:28 r He told me the matter of the play that was intended for his abuse, wherein they foolishly and sillily bring in two tables like that which he hath made, with a round hole in the middle, in his closet, to turn himself in.

1669-03-06 09:02   I to Sir W. Coventry at the Tower, and had a great deal of discourse with him; among others of the King’s putting him out of the Council yesterday, with which he is well contented, as with what else they can strip him of, he telling me that he is weary and surfeited of business.

1669-03-05 22:12 r Home, and there busy at the Office awhile, and so to bed, mightily pleased with being at peace with my poor wife, and with the pleasure we may hope to have with our coach this summer, when the weather comes to be good.

1669-03-05 17:49   My wife and I went the first time out of town with our coach and horses, and went as far as Bow, the spring beginning a little now to appear, though the way be dirty; and so, with great pleasure, with the fore-part of our coach up, we spent the afternoon.

1669-03-05 14:20   I to the Tower, where I find Sir W. Coventry with abundance of company with him; and after sitting awhile, and hearing some merry discourse, I away.

1669-03-05 07:03 r My wife had another bout with me, but I did make shift to quiet her, but yet she was not fully satisfied, poor wretch! in her mind, and thinks much of my taking so much pleasure from her; which, indeed, is a fault, though I did not design or foresee it when I went.

1669-03-04 21:50 r Home, and there my wife mighty angry for my absence, and fell mightily out, but not being certain of any thing, but thinks only that Pierce or Knepp was there, and did ask me, and, I perceive, the boy, many questions. But I did answer her; and so, after much ado, did go to bed.

1669-03-04 17:50 r I slunk out to Bagwell’s; and saw her, and her mother, and our late maid Nell, who cried for joy to see me, but I had no time for pleasure, but after drinking I back to the yard, having a month’s mind para have had a bout with Nell, which I could have had, and may another time.

1669-03-04 14:45 r I did find the Duke of York and Duchess, with all the great ladies, sitting upon a carpet, on the ground, there being no chairs, playing at “I love my love with an A, because he is so and so: and I hate him with an A, because of this and that:”

1669-03-04 14:20 r Having dined, and understanding by Blancfort how angry the Duke of York was about their offering to send Saville to the Gate-house; and then, observing how they are of a gang and did drink a health to the union of the two brothers, talking of others as their enemies, they parted.

1669-03-04 13:35 r And here drank most excellent, and great variety, and plenty of wines, more than I have drank, at once, these seven years, but yet did me no great hurt.

1669-03-04 13:20 r We were invited down to dinner with the Maids of Honour, namely, Mrs. Ogle, Blake, and Howard, which did me good to have the honour to dine with, and look on; and the Mother of the Maids, and Mrs. Howard, the mother of the Maid of Honour of that name, and the Duke’s housekeeper.

1669-03-04 12:12 r Sir Jer. Smith and I to Deptford, and there to the Treasurer’s house, where the Duke of York is, and his Duchess; and we find them at dinner; and there was my Lady Duchess of Monmouth, the Countess of Falmouth, Castlemayne, Henrietta Hide, and my Lady Peterborough.

1669-03-04 10:52 r To the Tower, where I find Sir W. Coventry in one Mr. Bennet’s house, son to Major Bayly, one of the Officers of the Ordnance, in the Bricke Tower: where I find him busy with my Lord Halifax and his brother; so I would not stay to interrupt them, but only to give him comfort.

1669-03-04 09:50 r Which W. Coventry not enduring, did by H. Saville send a letter to the Duke of Buckingham, that he had a desire to speak with him.

1669-03-04 09:48 r Meeting with my Lord Bellassis, he told me the particulars of this matter; that it arises about a quarrel which Sir W. Coventry had with the Duke of Buckingham about a design between him and Sir Robert Howard, to bring him into a play at the King’s house.

1669-03-04 09:20 r Sir W. Coventry being gone, the King will have never a good counsellor, nor the Duke of York any sure friend to stick to him; nor any good man will be left to advise what is good. This, therefore, do heartily trouble me as any thing that ever I heard.

1669-03-04 09:12 r This news of Sir W. Coventry did strike me to the heart, for by this and my Lord of Ormond’s business, I do doubt that the Duke of Buckingham will be so flushed, that he will not stop at any thing, but be forced to do any thing now, as thinking it not safe to end here.

1669-03-04 09:04   Sir Jeremy Smith did tell me that Sir W. Coventry was sent to the Tower, about the business of his challenging the Duke of Buckingham, and so was also Harry Saville to the Gate-house; which, as a gentleman, and of the Duke of York’s bedchamber, the Duke is mightily incensed at.

1669-03-03 18:36 r My Lord Mayor did retreat out of the Temple by stealth, with his sword up. This do make great heat among the students; and my Lord Mayor did send to the King, and also I hear that Sir Richard Browne did cause the drums to beat for the Train-bands, but all is over.

1669-03-03 18:33   My Lord Mayor, being invited to dinner at the Reader’s at the Temple, and endeavouring to carry his sword up, the students did pull it down, and forced him to go and stay all the day in a Councillor’s chamber, until the Reader himself could get the young gentlemen to dinner.

1669-03-03 17:10 r But it is but a sorry play, and the worse by how much my head is out of humour by being a little sleepy and my legs weary since last night.

1669-03-03 13:50   To Unthanke’s, and there took up my wife, and carried her to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there saw an old play, the first time acted these forty years, called “The Lady’s Tryall,” acted only by the young people of the house; but the house very full.

1669-03-03 12:30   To Dancre’s, the painter’s, and there saw my picture of Greenwich, finished to my very good content, though this manner of distemper do make the figures not so pleasing as in oyle.

1669-03-03 08:50 r I to my guests, and got them to breakfast, and then parted by coaches; and I did, in mine, carry my she-cozen Pepys and her daughters home, and there left them, and so to White Hall, where W. Hewer met me; and he and I took a turn in St. James’s Park.

1669-03-03 07:20   Up, after a very good night’s rest, and was called upon by Sir H. Cholmly, who was with me an hour, and though acquainted did not stay to talk with my company I had in the house, but away.

1669-03-03 03:38 r And so I did, to my great content, lodge at once in my house, with the greatest ease, fifteen, and eight of them strangers of quality. My wife this day put on first her French gown, called a Sac, which becomes her very well, brought her over by W. Batelier.

1669-03-03 03:34 r And myself and my wife in the maid’s bed, which is very good. Our maids in the coachman’s bed; the coachman with the boy in his settlebed, and Tom where he uses to lie.

1669-03-03 03:30 r This done, we parted, the strangers home, and I did lodge my cozen Pepys and his wife in our blue chamber. My cozen Turner, her sister, and The., in our best chamber; Bab., Betty, and Betty Turner, in our own chamber.

1669-03-03 02:50 r And then to a country-dance again, and so broke up with extraordinary pleasure, as being one of the days and nights of my life spent with the greatest content; and that which I can but hope to repeat again a few times in my whole life.

1669-03-03 02:20 r And so with mighty mirth, and pleased with their dancing of jigs afterwards several of them, and, among others, Betty Turner, who did it mighty prettily; and, lastly, W. Batelier’s “Blackmore and Blackmore Maid.”

1669-03-03 02:02 r We fell to dancing, and continued, only with intermission for a good supper, till two in the morning, the music being Greeting, and another most excellent violin, and theorbo, the best in town.

1669-03-02 18:30 r And thus till night, that our music come, and the Office ready and candles, and also W. Batelier and his sister Susan come, and also Will. Howe and two gentlemen more, strangers, which, at my request yesterday, he did bring to dance, called Mr. Ireton and Mr. Starkey.

1669-03-02 16:05 r The. Turner to write a letter to a lady in the country, in which I did, now and then, put in half a dozen words, and sometimes five or six lines, and then she as much, and made up a long and good letter, she being mighty witty really, though troublesome-humoured with it.

1669-03-02 14:40 r After dinner, we fell one to one talk, and another to another, and looking over my house, and closet, and things.

1669-03-02 13:30 r I had a noble dinner for them, as I almost ever had, and mighty merry, and particularly myself pleased with looking on Betty Turner, who is mighty pretty.

1669-03-02 12:04   Home, and I find my company come, namely, Madam Turner, Dyke, The., and Betty Turner, and Mr. Bellwood, formerly their father’s clerk, but now set up for himself — a conceited, silly fellow, but one they make mightily of — my cozen Roger Pepys, and his wife, and two daughters.

1669-03-01 22:04   Home, where W. Batelier come, and sat with us; and there, after many doubts, did resolve to go on with our feast and dancing tomorrow; and so, after supper, left the maids to make clean the house, and to lay the cloth, and other things against tomorrow, and we to bed.

1669-03-01 16:52   My wife and I out by hackneycoach, and spent the afternoon in several places, doing several things at the ’Change and elsewhere against tomorrow; and, among others, I did also bring home a piece of my face cast in plaster, for to make a vizard upon, for my eyes.

1669-03-01 11:50   Having walked some turns with my cozen Pepys, and most people, by their discourse, believing that this Parliament will never sit more, I away to several places to look after things against tomorrow’s feast.

1669-03-01 11:22 r But I, meeting Sir W. Coventry in the Duke of York’s chamber, he would not own it to me, but told me that he was a man of too much peace to meddle with fighting, and so it rested: but the talk is full in the town of the business.

1669-03-01 10:29   My Lord Bellassis, who, by appointment, met me at Auditor Wood’s, tells me of a duell designed between the Duke of Buckingham and my Lord Halifax, or Sir W. Coventry; the challenge being carried by Harry Saville, but prevented by my Lord Arlington, and the King told of it.

1669-03-01 09:45   I to Westminster Hall, where I have not been in some months. And here the Hall was very full, the King having, by Commission to some Lords this day, prorogued the Parliament till the 19th of October next: at which I am glad, hoping to have time to go over to France this year.

1669-03-01 09:03   I do hear that my Lady Paulina Montagu did die yesterday; at which I went to my Lord’s lodgings, but he is shut up with sorrow, and so not to be spoken with.
