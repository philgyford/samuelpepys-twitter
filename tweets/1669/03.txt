1669-03-08 20:40   With my wife alone to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Mocke Astrologer,” which I have often seen, and but an ordinary play; and then home, and there my wife to read to me, my eyes being sensibly hurt by the too great lights of the playhouse.

1669-03-08 09:58   Mr. Moore tells me that Mr. Shepley is upon being turned away from my Lord’s family, and another sent down, which I am sorry for; but his age and good fellowship have almost made him fit for nothing.

1669-03-08 09:00   To the Privy Seal Office, to examine what records I could find, for my help in the business I am put upon, of defending the present constitution of the Navy; but there could not have liberty without order from him that is in present waiting, Mr. Bickerstaffe, who is out of town.

1669-03-08 07:09   With W. Hewer by hackney coach to White Hall where the King and the Duke of York is gone by three in the morning, and had the misfortune to be overset with the Duke of York, the Duke of Monmouth, and the Prince, at the King’s Gate in Holborne; and the King all dirty but no hurt.

1669-03-07 11:55   I hear that tomorrow the King and the Duke of York set out for Newmarket, by three in the morning; to some foot and horse-races, to be abroad ten or twelve days.

1669-03-07 11:20   I perceive all the world is against the Duke of Buckingham his acting thus high, and do prophesy nothing but ruin from it. But he do observe that the church lands cannot certainly come to much, if the King shall be persuaded to take them; they being leased out for long leases.

1669-03-07 11:00 r They rose, having resolved upon sending six ships to the Streights, not being contented with the peace upon the terms they demand, which are, that all our ships, where any Turks or Moores shall be found slaves, shall be prizes; which will imply that they, must be searched.

1669-03-07 09:02   I to White Hall, and there hear that there are letters come from Sir Thomas Allen, that he hath made some kind of peace with Algiers; upon which the King and Duke of York, being to go out of town tomorrow, are met at my Lord Arlington’s, so I there.

1669-03-07 08:13   To the Tower, to see Sir W. Coventry, who had H. Jermin and a great many more with him; I do hear that there was not less than sixty coaches there yesterday, and the other day; which I hear also that there is a great exception taken at, by the King and the Duke of Buckingham.

1669-03-06 21:30   My wife made it appear to me that my late entertainment this week cost me above 12l., an expence which I am almost ashamed of, though it is but once in a great while, and is the end for which, in the most part, we live, to have such a merry day once or twice in a man’s life.

1669-03-06 09:50 r He repeated to me many examples of challenging of Privy-Councillors and others. He tells me of his being weary of the Treasury, and of the folly, ambition, and desire of popularity of Sir Thomas Clifford; and yet the rudeness of his tongue and passions when angry.

1669-03-06 09:30 r And he is to be in one of them as master, and Sir J. Duncomb in the other, as his man or imitator: and their discourse in those tables, about the disposing of their books and papers, very foolish.

1669-03-06 09:28 r He told me the matter of the play that was intended for his abuse, wherein they foolishly and sillily bring in two tables like that which he hath made, with a round hole in the middle, in his closet, to turn himself in.

1669-03-06 09:02   I to Sir W. Coventry at the Tower, and had a great deal of discourse with him; among others of the King’s putting him out of the Council yesterday, with which he is well contented, as with what else they can strip him of, he telling me that he is weary and surfeited of business.

1669-03-05 22:12 r Home, and there busy at the Office awhile, and so to bed, mightily pleased with being at peace with my poor wife, and with the pleasure we may hope to have with our coach this summer, when the weather comes to be good.

1669-03-05 17:49   My wife and I went the first time out of town with our coach and horses, and went as far as Bow, the spring beginning a little now to appear, though the way be dirty; and so, with great pleasure, with the fore-part of our coach up, we spent the afternoon.

1669-03-05 14:20   I to the Tower, where I find Sir W. Coventry with abundance of company with him; and after sitting awhile, and hearing some merry discourse, I away.

1669-03-05 07:03 r My wife had another bout with me, but I did make shift to quiet her, but yet she was not fully satisfied, poor wretch! in her mind, and thinks much of my taking so much pleasure from her; which, indeed, is a fault, though I did not design or foresee it when I went.

1669-03-04 21:50 r Home, and there my wife mighty angry for my absence, and fell mightily out, but not being certain of any thing, but thinks only that Pierce or Knepp was there, and did ask me, and, I perceive, the boy, many questions. But I did answer her; and so, after much ado, did go to bed.

1669-03-04 17:50 r I slunk out to Bagwell’s; and saw her, and her mother, and our late maid Nell, who cried for joy to see me, but I had no time for pleasure, but after drinking I back to the yard, having a month’s mind para have had a bout with Nell, which I could have had, and may another time.

1669-03-04 14:45 r I did find the Duke of York and Duchess, with all the great ladies, sitting upon a carpet, on the ground, there being no chairs, playing at “I love my love with an A, because he is so and so: and I hate him with an A, because of this and that:”

1669-03-04 14:20 r Having dined, and understanding by Blancfort how angry the Duke of York was about their offering to send Saville to the Gate-house; and then, observing how they are of a gang and did drink a health to the union of the two brothers, talking of others as their enemies, they parted.

1669-03-04 13:35 r And here drank most excellent, and great variety, and plenty of wines, more than I have drank, at once, these seven years, but yet did me no great hurt.

1669-03-04 13:20 r We were invited down to dinner with the Maids of Honour, namely, Mrs. Ogle, Blake, and Howard, which did me good to have the honour to dine with, and look on; and the Mother of the Maids, and Mrs. Howard, the mother of the Maid of Honour of that name, and the Duke’s housekeeper.

1669-03-04 12:12 r Sir Jer. Smith and I to Deptford, and there to the Treasurer’s house, where the Duke of York is, and his Duchess; and we find them at dinner; and there was my Lady Duchess of Monmouth, the Countess of Falmouth, Castlemayne, Henrietta Hide, and my Lady Peterborough.

1669-03-04 10:52 r To the Tower, where I find Sir W. Coventry in one Mr. Bennet’s house, son to Major Bayly, one of the Officers of the Ordnance, in the Bricke Tower: where I find him busy with my Lord Halifax and his brother; so I would not stay to interrupt them, but only to give him comfort.

1669-03-04 09:50 r Which W. Coventry not enduring, did by H. Saville send a letter to the Duke of Buckingham, that he had a desire to speak with him.

1669-03-04 09:48 r Meeting with my Lord Bellassis, he told me the particulars of this matter; that it arises about a quarrel which Sir W. Coventry had with the Duke of Buckingham about a design between him and Sir Robert Howard, to bring him into a play at the King’s house.

1669-03-04 09:20 r Sir W. Coventry being gone, the King will have never a good counsellor, nor the Duke of York any sure friend to stick to him; nor any good man will be left to advise what is good. This, therefore, do heartily trouble me as any thing that ever I heard.

1669-03-04 09:12 r This news of Sir W. Coventry did strike me to the heart, for by this and my Lord of Ormond’s business, I do doubt that the Duke of Buckingham will be so flushed, that he will not stop at any thing, but be forced to do any thing now, as thinking it not safe to end here.

1669-03-04 09:04   Sir Jeremy Smith did tell me that Sir W. Coventry was sent to the Tower, about the business of his challenging the Duke of Buckingham, and so was also Harry Saville to the Gate-house; which, as a gentleman, and of the Duke of York’s bedchamber, the Duke is mightily incensed at.

1669-03-03 18:36 r My Lord Mayor did retreat out of the Temple by stealth, with his sword up. This do make great heat among the students; and my Lord Mayor did send to the King, and also I hear that Sir Richard Browne did cause the drums to beat for the Train-bands, but all is over.

1669-03-03 18:33   My Lord Mayor, being invited to dinner at the Reader’s at the Temple, and endeavouring to carry his sword up, the students did pull it down, and forced him to go and stay all the day in a Councillor’s chamber, until the Reader himself could get the young gentlemen to dinner.

1669-03-03 17:10 r But it is but a sorry play, and the worse by how much my head is out of humour by being a little sleepy and my legs weary since last night.

1669-03-03 13:50   To Unthanke’s, and there took up my wife, and carried her to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there saw an old play, the first time acted these forty years, called “The Lady’s Tryall,” acted only by the young people of the house; but the house very full.

1669-03-03 12:30   To Dancre’s, the painter’s, and there saw my picture of Greenwich, finished to my very good content, though this manner of distemper do make the figures not so pleasing as in oyle.

1669-03-03 08:50 r I to my guests, and got them to breakfast, and then parted by coaches; and I did, in mine, carry my she-cozen Pepys and her daughters home, and there left them, and so to White Hall, where W. Hewer met me; and he and I took a turn in St. James’s Park.

1669-03-03 07:20   Up, after a very good night’s rest, and was called upon by Sir H. Cholmly, who was with me an hour, and though acquainted did not stay to talk with my company I had in the house, but away.

1669-03-03 03:38 r And so I did, to my great content, lodge at once in my house, with the greatest ease, fifteen, and eight of them strangers of quality. My wife this day put on first her French gown, called a Sac, which becomes her very well, brought her over by W. Batelier.

1669-03-03 03:34 r And myself and my wife in the maid’s bed, which is very good. Our maids in the coachman’s bed; the coachman with the boy in his settlebed, and Tom where he uses to lie.

1669-03-03 03:30 r This done, we parted, the strangers home, and I did lodge my cozen Pepys and his wife in our blue chamber. My cozen Turner, her sister, and The., in our best chamber; Bab., Betty, and Betty Turner, in our own chamber.

1669-03-03 02:50 r And then to a country-dance again, and so broke up with extraordinary pleasure, as being one of the days and nights of my life spent with the greatest content; and that which I can but hope to repeat again a few times in my whole life.

1669-03-03 02:20 r And so with mighty mirth, and pleased with their dancing of jigs afterwards several of them, and, among others, Betty Turner, who did it mighty prettily; and, lastly, W. Batelier’s “Blackmore and Blackmore Maid.”

1669-03-03 02:02 r We fell to dancing, and continued, only with intermission for a good supper, till two in the morning, the music being Greeting, and another most excellent violin, and theorbo, the best in town.

1669-03-02 18:30 r And thus till night, that our music come, and the Office ready and candles, and also W. Batelier and his sister Susan come, and also Will. Howe and two gentlemen more, strangers, which, at my request yesterday, he did bring to dance, called Mr. Ireton and Mr. Starkey.

1669-03-02 16:05 r The. Turner to write a letter to a lady in the country, in which I did, now and then, put in half a dozen words, and sometimes five or six lines, and then she as much, and made up a long and good letter, she being mighty witty really, though troublesome-humoured with it.

1669-03-02 14:40 r After dinner, we fell one to one talk, and another to another, and looking over my house, and closet, and things.

1669-03-02 13:30 r I had a noble dinner for them, as I almost ever had, and mighty merry, and particularly myself pleased with looking on Betty Turner, who is mighty pretty.

1669-03-02 12:04   Home, and I find my company come, namely, Madam Turner, Dyke, The., and Betty Turner, and Mr. Bellwood, formerly their father’s clerk, but now set up for himself — a conceited, silly fellow, but one they make mightily of — my cozen Roger Pepys, and his wife, and two daughters.

1669-03-01 22:04   Home, where W. Batelier come, and sat with us; and there, after many doubts, did resolve to go on with our feast and dancing tomorrow; and so, after supper, left the maids to make clean the house, and to lay the cloth, and other things against tomorrow, and we to bed.

1669-03-01 16:52   My wife and I out by hackneycoach, and spent the afternoon in several places, doing several things at the ’Change and elsewhere against tomorrow; and, among others, I did also bring home a piece of my face cast in plaster, for to make a vizard upon, for my eyes.

1669-03-01 11:50   Having walked some turns with my cozen Pepys, and most people, by their discourse, believing that this Parliament will never sit more, I away to several places to look after things against tomorrow’s feast.

1669-03-01 11:22 r But I, meeting Sir W. Coventry in the Duke of York’s chamber, he would not own it to me, but told me that he was a man of too much peace to meddle with fighting, and so it rested: but the talk is full in the town of the business.

1669-03-01 10:29   My Lord Bellassis, who, by appointment, met me at Auditor Wood’s, tells me of a duell designed between the Duke of Buckingham and my Lord Halifax, or Sir W. Coventry; the challenge being carried by Harry Saville, but prevented by my Lord Arlington, and the King told of it.

1669-03-01 09:45   I to Westminster Hall, where I have not been in some months. And here the Hall was very full, the King having, by Commission to some Lords this day, prorogued the Parliament till the 19th of October next: at which I am glad, hoping to have time to go over to France this year.

1669-03-01 09:03   I do hear that my Lady Paulina Montagu did die yesterday; at which I went to my Lord’s lodgings, but he is shut up with sorrow, and so not to be spoken with.
