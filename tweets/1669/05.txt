1669-05-16 17:04   I all the afternoon drawing up a foul draught of my petition to the Duke of York, about my eyes, for leave to spend three or four months out of the Office, drawing it so as to give occasion to a voyage abroad which I did, to my pretty good liking.

1669-05-16 09:03   My wife and I at church, our pew filled with Mrs. Backewell, and six more that she brought with her, which vexed me at her confidence.

1669-05-15 14:58   Dined at home and Creed with me home, and I did discourse about evening some reckonings with him in the afternoon; but I could not, for my eyes, do it, which troubled me, and vexed him that would not; but yet we were friends.

1669-05-14 22:10 r So home, sullen; but then my wife and I by water, with my brother, as high as Fulham, talking and singing, and playing the rogue with the Western barge-men, about the women of Woolwich, which mads them, an so back home to supper and to bed.

1669-05-14 17:33   To Unthanke’s, and there find my wife, but not dressed, which vexed me, because going to the Park, it being a most pleasant day after yesterday’s rain, which lays all the dust, and most people going out thither, which vexed me.

1669-05-14 16:42   Sir Thomas Osborne, to my great content, did of his own accord fall into discourse with me, with so much professions of value and respect, placing the whole virtue of the Office of the Navy upon me, and that for the Comptroller’s place, no man in England was fit for it but me.

1669-05-14 14:55 r I did wonder to have the Bishop at this time to make himself sport with things of this kind, but I perceive it was shown him as a rarity; and he took care to have the room-door shut, but there were about twenty gentlemen there, and myself, infinitely pleased with the novelty.

1669-05-14 14:45 r And his text about the hanging up their harps upon the willows: and a serious good sermon too, exclaiming against Bishops, and crying up of my good Lord Eglinton, a till it made us all burst.

1669-05-14 14:30 r I going, I heard of a sermon that was to be there; and so I staid to hear it, thinking it serious, till by and by the gentleman told me it was a mockery, by one Cornet Bolton, that behind a chair did pray and preach like a Presbyter Scot that ever I heard in my life.

1669-05-14 13:40 r Exceeding great cheer, no where better, or so much, that ever I think I saw, for an ordinary table: and the Bishop mighty kind to me, particularly desiring my company another time, when less company there.

1669-05-14 12:14   With Mr. Wren to Lambeth, to dinner with the Archbishop of Canterbury; the first time I was ever there and I have long longed for it; where a noble house, and well furnished with good pictures and furniture, and noble attendance in good order, and great deal of company.

1669-05-13 16:55   At noon comes my Lord Hinchingbroke, and Sidney, and Sir Charles Harbord, and Roger Pepys, and dined with me; and had a good dinner, and very merry with; us all the afternoon, it being a farewell to Sidney.

1669-05-12 19:49   Home and find my brother John, come to town from Ellington, where, he tell me the first news that my sister is with child, and far gone, which I know not whether it did more trouble or please me, having no great care for my friends to have children; though I love other people’s.

1669-05-12 17:28   My wife and I to the Duke of York’s playhouse and, in the side balcony, over against the music, did hear, but not see, a new play, the first day acted, “The Roman Virgin,” an old play, and but ordinary; but the trouble of my eyes with the light of the candles did almost kill me.

1669-05-12 10:22 r But, Lord! how silly the woman talks of her great entertainment there, and how all the gentry come to visit her, and that she believes her husband is worth 6 or 700l., which nevertheless I am glad of, but I doubt they will spend it as fast.

1669-05-12 10:10   To Mrs. Martin’s lodging, who come to town last night, and there yo did hazer her, she having been a month, I think, at Portsmouth with her husband, newly come home from the Streights.

1669-05-11 20:55   My wife and I all alone, with the boy, by water, up as high as Putney almost, with the tide, and back again; talking, and singing, and reading a foolish copy of verses upon my Lord Mayor’s entertaining of all the bachelors, designed in praise to my Lord Mayor.

1669-05-11 07:40   My wife again up by four o’clock, to go to gather May-dew; and so back home by seven, to bed, and by and by I up and to the office.

1669-05-10 18:50 r Which vexed me also, so as to resolve never to appear in Court with them, but presently to have them taken off, as it is fit I should, and so to my wife at Unthanke’s, and coach, and so called at my tailor’s to that purpose.

1669-05-10 17:45   Walked a little with Creed, who tells me he hears how fine my horses and coach are, and advises me to avoid being noted for it, which I was vexed to hear taken notice of, it being what I feared and Povy told me of my gold-lace sleeves in the Park yesterday.

1669-05-10 16:30   Drank at Cragg’s with Doll, and so to the Swan, and there besard a new maid that is there, and so to White Hall again, to a Committee of Tangier, where I see all things going to rack in the business of the Corporation, and consequently in the place, by Middleton’s going.

1669-05-10 15:22   A stranger, a country gentleman, told us that he hath heard his father say, that in his time it was so rare for a country gentleman to come to London, that, when he did come, he used to make his will before he set out.

1669-05-10 06:14 r But I to sleep again, and she come home about six, and to bed again all well.

1669-05-10 03:04   Troubled, about three in the morning, with my wife’s calling her maid up, and rising herself, to go with her coach abroad, to gather May-dew, which she did, and I troubled for it, for fear of any hurt, going abroad so betimes, happening to her.

1669-05-09 22:10   This day I first left off both my waistcoats by day, and my waistcoat by night, it being very hot weather, so hot as to make me break out, here and there, in my hands, which vexes me to see, but is good for me.

1669-05-09 21:30 r Towards the Park, but too soon to go in, so went on to Knightsbridge, and there eat and drank at “The World’s End,” where we had good things, and then back to the Park, and there till night, being fine weather, and much company.

1669-05-09 14:10   To St. Andrew’s, Holborne, but we could not get a place, and so to St. Margaret’s, Westminster, and there heard a sermon, the first we have heard there these many years, and here at a distance I saw Betty Michell, but she is become much a plainer woman than she was a girl.

1669-05-08 18:44   Browne, the mathematical instrument maker, brings me my instrument for perspective, made according to the description of Dr. Wren’s; and he hath made it very well, that I believe will do the thing; but have I fear all the content that must be received by my eyes is almost lost.

1669-05-08 17:55   My bookseller brings me bound my collection of papers, about my Addresse to the Duke of York, which makes me glad, it being that which shall do me more right many years hence than all I ever did in my life: and therefore I do, both for my own and the King’s sake, value it much.

1669-05-08 12:01 r I do begin there, and I did sit with much more content than I had done on the other side for a great while, and in winter the fire will not trouble my back.

1669-05-08 11:58   At the Office all the morning, and this day, the first time, did alter my side of the table, after above eight years sitting on that next the fire. But now I am not able to bear the light of the windows in my eyes.

1669-05-08 08:37   There comes Lead to me, and at last my vizards are done, and glasses got to put in and out, as I will; and I have brought it to the utmost, for easiness of using and benefit; and so I paid him 15s. for what he hath done now last and they, I hope, will do me a great deal of ease.

1669-05-07 19:33 r He did once offer to show Harris it, but Harris told him that he would judge by one Act whether it were good or no, which is a foolish saying, and we see them out themselves in a play after they have read the whole, it being sometimes found not fit to act above three times.

1669-05-07 19:28 r Home, and there met with a letter from Captain Silas Taylor, and, with it, his written copy of a play that he hath wrote, and intends to have acted. — It is called “The Serenade, or Disappointment,” which I will read, not believing he can make any good of that kind.

1669-05-07 17:38   With my wife abroad, with our coach, most pleasant weather; and to Hackney, and into the marshes, where I never was before, and thence round about to Old Ford and Bow.

1669-05-07 15:08 r But I wondering how she come to know it, she tells me a woman that my wife spoke to for a maid, did tell her so, and that a lady that desires to go thither would be glad to go in her company.

1669-05-07 15:04   To see my Lord Brouncker, who is a little ill of the gout; and there Madam Williams told me that she heard that my wife was going into France this year, which I did not deny, if I can get time, and I pray God I may.

1669-05-07 10:04 r I passed by Guildhall, which is almost finished, and saw a poor labourer carried by, I think, dead with a fall, as many there are, I hear.

1669-05-07 09:45   Walked home round by the Excise Office, having by private vows last night in prayer to God Almighty cleared my mind for the present of the thoughts of going to Deb. at Greenwich, which I did long after.

1669-05-07 09:20   To the Duke of York, having a great mind to speak to him about Tangier; but, when I come to it, his interest for my Lord Middleton is such that I dare not.

1669-05-06 22:10   Home, and to walk in the garden, and so to supper and to bed, my eyes being bad with writing my journal, part of it, tonight.

1669-05-06 16:38   With my wife by coach to take the ayre, it being a noble day, as far as the Greene Man, mightily pleased with our journey, and our condition of doing it in our own coach.

1669-05-05 21:40   I to the office, and there till night, and then to my wife, and she read to me the Epistle of Cassandra, which is very good indeed; and the better to her, because recommended by Sheres.

1669-05-05 14:25 r And by and by he and I to talk, and the company very merry at my defending Cambridge against Oxford: and I made much use of my French and Spanish here, to my great content. But the dinner not extraordinary at all, either for quantity or quality.

1669-05-05 13:42 r This man, though a gentle sort of scholar, yet sat like a fool for want of French or Spanish, but only Latin, which he spoke like an Englishman to one of the Fathers.

1669-05-05 13:33 r And here was an Oxford scholar in a Doctor of Law’s gowne, sent from the College where the Embassador lay, when the Court was there, to salute him before his return to Spain.

1669-05-05 12:48   With Sir Thomas Allen, and Sir Edward Scott, and Lord Carlingford, to the Spanish Embassador’s. The Olio not so good as Sheres’s. There was at the table himself and a Spanish Countess, a good, comely, and witty lady — three Fathers and us. Discourse good and pleasant.

1669-05-05 07:10   Up, and thought to have gone with Lord Brouncker to Mr. Hooke this morning betimes; but my Lord is taken ill of the gout, and says his new lodgings have infected him, he never having had any symptoms of it till now.

1669-05-04 21:40   At night walked with my wife in the garden, and my Lord Brouncker with us, who is newly come to W. Pen’s lodgings; and by and by comes Mr. Hooke; and my Lord, and he, and I into my Lord’s lodgings, and there discoursed of many fine things in philosophy, to my great content.

1669-05-04 14:22 r After dinner comes home my wife, who I believe is jealous of my spending the day, and I had very good fortune in being at home, for if Deb. had been to have been found it is forty to one but I had been abroad, God forgive me.

1669-05-04 09:10 r Having bought a book to satisfy the bookseller for my stay there, a 12d. book, Andronicus of Tom Fuller, I took coach, and at the end of Jewen Street next Red Cross Street I sent the coachman to her lodging, and understand she is gone for Greenwich to one Marys’s, a tanner’s.

1669-05-04 08:45   My wife being gone to see her mother at Deptford, I before the office sat went to the Excise Office, and thence being alone stepped into Duck Lane, and thence tried to have sent a porter to Deb.’s, but durst not trust him.

1669-05-03 22:15   Home, and at the office busy all the afternoon, and so to supper and to bed.

1669-05-03 13:01   I took Creed to the Harp and Balls, and there drank a cup of ale, and discoursed of matters; and I perceive by him that he makes no doubt but that all will turn to the old religion, for these people cannot hold things in their hands, nor prevent its coming to that.

1669-05-03 11:50 r Among other things, he tells me how the King will not yet be got to name anybody in the room of Pen, but puts it off for three or four days; from whence he do collect that they are brewing something for the Navy, but what he knows not.

1669-05-03 11:44   To St. James’s, where the Duke of York was playing in the Pell Mell; and so he called me to him most part of the time that he played, which was an hour, and talked alone to me.

1669-05-03 09:52 r But by our meeting we do all begin to recollect enough to preserve Mr. Deering, I think, which, poor silly man! I shall be glad of, it being too much he should suffer for endeavouring to serve us.

1669-05-03 09:11   Sir G. Carteret did meet Sir J. Minnes and me, to discourse upon Mr. Deering’s business, who was directed, in the time of the war, to provide provisions at Hamburgh, by Sir G. Carteret’s direction; and now G. Carteret is afeard to own it, it being done without written order.

1669-05-02 22:22   So home and to supper, and my wife to read, and Tom, my Nepotisme, and then to bed.

1669-05-02 20:32   To the Park, and there spent the evening with much pleasure, it proving clear after a little shower, and we mighty fine as yesterday, and people pleased with our coach; but I had not on my fine suit, being afeard to wear it, it being so fine with the gold lace, though not gay.

1669-05-02 09:42   Here with Sir Charles Herbert, and my Lord Hinchingbroke, and Sidney, we looked upon the picture of Tangier, drawn by Dancre, which my Lord Sandwich admires, as being the truest picture that ever he’s saw in his life: and it is indeed very pretty.

1669-05-02 09:20 r I saw him, and very kind; and I am glad he is so, I having not wrote to him all the time, my eyes indeed not letting me.

1669-05-02 08:10   Up, and by water to White Hall, and there visit my Lord Sandwich, who, after about two months’ absence at Hinchingbroke, come to town last night.

1669-05-01 20:10 r Home, leaving Mr. Sheres at St. James’s Gate, where he took leave of us for altogether, he being this night to set out for Portsmouth post, in his way to Tangier, which troubled my wife mightily, who is mighty, though not, I think, too fond of him.

1669-05-01 18:48 r But here was W. Batelier and his sister in a borrowed coach by themselves, and I took them and we to the lodge; and at the door did give them a syllabub, and other things, cost me 12s., and pretty merry.

1669-05-01 17:35 r The Park full of coaches, but dusty and windy, and cold, and now and then a little dribbling rain; and, what made it worst, there were so many hackney-coaches as spoiled the sight of the gentlemen’s; and so we had little pleasure.

1669-05-01 16:15 r And she then expected to meet Sheres, which we did in the Pell Mell, and, against my will, I was forced to take him into the coach, but was sullen all day almost, and little complaisant, the day also being unpleasing.

1669-05-01 15:50 r But we set out, out of humour — I because Betty, whom I expected, was not come to go with us; and my wife that I would sit on the same seat with her, which she likes not, being so fine.

1669-05-01 15:10 r And, the truth is, I did not see any coach more pretty, though more gay, than ours.

1669-05-01 14:27 r And so anon we went alone through the town with our new liveries of serge, and the horses’ manes and tails tied with red ribbons, and the standards there gilt with varnish, and all clean, and green refines, that people did mightily look upon us.

1669-05-01 12:20 r Home to dinner, and there find my wife extraordinary fine, with her flowered tabby gown that she made two years ago, now laced exceeding pretty; and was fine all over, and earnest to go, though the day was very lowering; and she would have me put on my fine suit, which I did.

1669-05-01 11:58 r But put on the stuff suit I made the last year, which is now repaired; and so did go to the Office in it, and sat all the morning, the day looking as if it would be fowle.

1669-05-01 08:10   Called up by my tailor, and there first put on a summer suit this year; but it was not my fine one of flowered tabby vest, and coloured camelott tunic, because it was too fine with the gold lace at the hands, that I was afeard to be seen in it.
