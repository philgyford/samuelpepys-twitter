1669-01-31 22:05 r But this night we are at present very kind.

1669-01-31 22:03   And thus endeth this month, with many different days of sadness and mirth, from differences between me and my wife, from her remembrance of my late unkindness to her with Willet, but now and then hath her passionate remembrance of it as often as prompted to it by any occasion.

1669-01-31 22:00   After dinner to get my wife and boy, one after another, to read to me: and so spent the afternoon and the evening, and so after supper to bed.

1669-01-31 09:15 r The truth is, I did observe Mrs. Hollworthy smile often, and many others of the parish, who, I perceive, have known him, and were in mighty expectation of hearing him preach, but could not forbear smiling, and she particularly upon me, and I on her.

1669-01-31 09:10   I to church, and did hear the Doctor that is turned Divine, Dr. Waterhouse; He preaches in a devout manner of way, not elegant nor very persuasive, but seems to mean well, and that he would preach holily; and was mighty passionate against people that make a scoff of religion.

1669-01-30 22:22 r After supper, and W. Batelier gone, my wife begun another book I lately bought, called “The State of England,” which promises well, and is worth reading, and so after a while to bed.

1669-01-30 18:34 r To read a French discourse, which W. Batelier hath brought over, to invite the people of France to apply themselves to Navigation, which it do very well, and is certainly their interest, and what will undo us in a few years, if the King of France goes on to fit up his Navy.

1669-01-30 17:04   I spent all the afternoon with my wife and W. Batelier talking, and then making them read, and particularly made an end of Mr. Boyle’s Book of Formes, which I am glad to have over.

1669-01-30 10:20   Lay long in bed, it being a fast-day for the murder of the late King; and so up and to church, where Dr. Hicks made a dull sermon.

1669-01-29 20:20   Mr. Ned Pickering brought his lady to see my wife, in acknowledgment of a little present of oranges and olives, which I sent her, for his kindness to me in the buying of my horses, which was very civil. She is old, but hath, I believe, been a pretty comely woman.

1669-01-29 17:01 r Creed shewed me a copy of some propositions, which Bland and others did present to Norwood, for his opinion in, which were drawn up very humbly; but his answer to them was in the most shitten proud, carping, insolent, and ironically-prophane stile, that ever I saw in my life.

1669-01-29 16:35   To see Creed’s wife, and did so, and staid a while, where both of them within; and here I met Mr. Bland, newly come from Cales after his differences with Norwood. I think him a foolish, light-headed man; but certainly he hath been abused in this matter by Colonel Norwood.

1669-01-29 14:44   Roger Pepys, and I, and my wife, and aunt to see Mr. Cole; but he nor his wife was within, but we looked upon his picture of Cleopatra, which I went to see, being commended by my wife and aunt; but I find it a base copy of a good originall that vexed me to hear so much commended.

1669-01-29 09:23 r This I was glad of, and so were all the rest of us, though I know I have made myself an immortal enemy by it.

1669-01-29 09:19 r I thought it a good occasion to make an example of him, for he is a proud, idle fellow; and it did meet with the Duke of York’s acceptance and well-liking; and he did call him in, and did not only give him a soft rebuke, but condemns him to pay both their victuals and wages.

1669-01-29 09:10   With W. Hewer in Colonel Middleton’s coach to White Hall, and there to the Duke of York, to attend him, where among other things I did give a severe account of our proceedings, and what we found, in the business of Sir W. Jenings’s demand of Supernumeraries.

1669-01-28 21:05 r He designs to give it me, in thanks for my paying him his 100l. in money, for his service at Tangier, which was ordered him; but I do intend to force him to make me pay for it. But I yet, without his direction, cannot tell how it is to be made use of.

1669-01-28 21:02   I find that Mr. Sheres hath, beyond his promise, not only got me a candlestick made me, after a form he remembers to have seen in Spain, for keeping the light from one’s eyes, but hath got it done in silver very neat.

1669-01-27 17:04 r My cozen Turner, and I, and Roger, and his mistress, to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there saw “The Five Hours’ Adventure,” which hath not been acted a good while before, but once, and is a most excellent play, I must confess.

1669-01-27 12:27   Away to my cozen Turner’s, where I find Roger Pepys come last night to town, and here is his mistress, Mrs. Dickenson, and by and by comes in Mr. Turner, a worthy, sober, serious man — I honour him mightily.

1669-01-27 11:32   I by hackney to the Temple to the Auditor’s man, and with him to a tavern to meet with another under-auditor to advise about the clearing of my Lord Bellasses’ accounts without injuring myself and perplexing my accounts.

1669-01-27 10:00   To White Hall, where I was put to it to make good our letter complaining against my Lord Anglesey’s failing us in the payment of the moneys assigned us upon the Customs, and I know will tell my Lord; but it is no matter, I am over shy already, and therefore must not fear.

1669-01-26 19:04 r As also one or two printed music-books of songs; but my eyes are now too much out of tune to look upon them with any pleasure.

1669-01-26 19:00   I find W. Batelier hath also sent the books which I made him bring me out of France. Among others, L’Estat de France, Marnix, &c., to my great content; and so I was well pleased with them, and shall take a time to look them over.

1669-01-26 14:47 r I answered them to what they demanded of me, which was but some few mean things; but I see that on all these occasions they seem to rely most upon me.

1669-01-26 14:20 r The business is that the Algerines have broke the peace with us by taking some Spaniards and goods out of an English ship, which had the Duke of York’s pass; and the King is resolved to stop Sir Thomas Allen’s fleet from coming home till he hath amends made him for this affront.

1669-01-26 13:55 r And here was the King and the Cabinet met; and, being called in, among the rest I find my Lord Privy Seale, whom I never before knew to be in so much play, as to be of the Cabinet.

1669-01-26 13:37   To White Hall, leaving my wife at Unthanke’s; and I to the Secretary’s chamber, where I was, by particular order, this day summoned to attend, as I find Sir D. Gawden also was.

1669-01-25 22:18 r He hath also brought a great many gloves perfumed, of several sorts; but all too big by half for her, and yet she will have two or three dozen of them, which vexed me, and made me angry. So she, at last, to please me, did come to take what alone I thought fit, which pleased me.

1669-01-25 21:45   My wife showed me many excellent prints of Nanteuil’s and others, which W. Batelier hath, at my desire, brought me out of France, of the King, and Colbert, and others, most excellent, to my great content.

1669-01-25 21:20   Up, and to the Committee of Tangier, where little done, and thence I home by my own coach, and busy after dinner at my office all the afternoon till late at night, that my eyes were tired.

1669-01-24 20:52   At supper come W. Batelier and supped with us, and told us many pretty things of France, and the greatness of the present King.

1669-01-24 16:57 r The King seemed mighty full that we should have money to do all that we desired, and satisfied that, without it, nothing could be done: and so, without determining any thing, we were dismissed; and I doubt all will end in some little fleet this year.

1669-01-24 16:45 r Then they demanded in what time we could set out forty ships. It was answered, as they might be chosen of the newest and most ready, we could, with money, get forty ready against May.

1669-01-24 16:33 r The Surveyor answered, in two years, and not sooner. I did give them hopes that, with supplies of money suitable, we might have them all fit for sea some part of the summer after this.

1669-01-24 16:21 r Here all the Officers of the Navy attended, and by and by were called in to the King and Cabinet, where my Lord, who was ill, did lie upon the bed; and the business was to know in what time all the King’s ships might be repaired, fit for service.

1669-01-24 15:52 r By and by the King comes out, and so I took coach, and followed his coaches to my Lord Keeper’s, at Essex House, where I never was before, since I saw my old Lord Essex lie in state when he was dead; a large, but ugly house.

1669-01-24 15:21 r I to talk with Tom Killigrew, who told me and others, talking about the playhouse, that he is fain to keep a woman on purpose at 20s. a week to satisfy 8 or 10 of the young men of his house, whom till he did so he could never keep to their business, and now he do.

1669-01-24 14:55   I to Whitehall, and here I met Will. Batelier, newly come post from France, his boots all dirty. He brought letters to the King, and I glad to see him, it having been reported that he was drowned, for some days past.

1669-01-24 14:10   With my wife by coach, to cozen Turner’s, where she and The. gone to church, but I left my wife with Mrs. Dyke and Joyce Norton, whom I have not seen till now since their coming to town: she is become an old woman, and with as cunning a look as ever.

1669-01-24 06:33   An order brought me in bed, for the Principal Officers to attend the King at my Lord Keeper’s this afternoon, it being resolved late the last night.

1669-01-23 22:14 r I did think I might have got them from the little boy, but they did presently look him, and found none. So how they come I know not, but presently did shift myself, and so shall be rid of them, and cut my hair close to my head, and so with much content to bed.

1669-01-23 21:07 r To my wife’s chamber and got her cut my hair and look my shirt, for I have itched mightily these 6 or 7 days, and she finds that I am lousy, having found in my head and body about twenty lice, little and great, which I wonder at, being more than I have had these 20 years.

1669-01-23 19:58 r The truth is, I have some fear that I am more behind-hand in the world for these last two years, since I for some time could not look after my accounts, which do allay my pleasure. But I do trust in God I am pretty well yet, and resolve, to look into my accounts.

1669-01-23 19:10 r Thus was this entertainment over, the best of its kind, and the fullest of honour and content to me, that ever I had in my life: and shall not easily have so good again.

1669-01-23 19:01 r After dinner, my Lords to cards, and the rest of us sitting about them and talking, and looking on my books and pictures, and my wife’s drawings, which they commend mightily; and mighty merry all day long, with exceeding great content.

1669-01-23 15:05 r And indeed it was, of a dinner of about six or eight dishes, as noble as any man need to have, I think; at least, all was done in the noblest manner that ever I had any, and I have rarely seen in my life better anywhere else, even at the Court.

1669-01-23 14:30 r Dinner was brought up, one dish after another, but a dish at a time, but all so good; but, above all things, the variety of wines, and excellent of their kind, I had for them, and all in so good order, that they were mightily pleased, and myself full of content at it.

1669-01-23 12:15   Word brought me to the Board that my Lord Sandwich was come; so I presently rose, leaving the Board ready to rise, and I found my Lord Sandwich, Peterborough, and Sir Charles Harbord; and presently after them comes my Lord Hinchingbroke, Mr. Sidney, and Sir William Godolphin.

1669-01-22 22:18   So to supper, with much kindness between me and my wife, which, now-a-days, is all my care, and so to bed.

1669-01-22 17:32   To my office, and then home to look after things against tomorrow, and among other things was mightily pleased with the fellow that come to lay the cloth, and fold the napkins, which I like so well as that I am resolved to give him 40s. to teach my wife to do it.

1669-01-22 10:04 r At the ’Change I met with Mr. Dancre, the famous landscape painter, with whom I was on Wednesday; and he took measure of my panels in my dining-room, where, in the four, I intend to have the four houses of the King, White Hall, Hampton Court, Greenwich, and Windsor.

1669-01-22 09:10   To White Hall, and there attended the Duke of York, and thence to the Exchange, in the way calling at several places on occasions relating to my feast tomorrow, on which my mind is now set; as how to get a new looking-glass for my dining-room, and some pewter, and good wine.

1669-01-21 22:57 r So, late up, silent, and not supping, but hearing my wife utter some words of discontent to me with silence, and so to bed, weeping to myself for grief, which she discerning, come to bed, and mighty kind, and so with great joy on both sides to sleep.

1669-01-21 19:15 r My wife and I home, where my wife mighty dogged, and I vexed to see it, being mightily troubled, of late, at her being out of humour, for fear of her discovering any new matter of offence against me, though I am conscious of none; but do hate to be unquiet at home.

1669-01-21 17:20 r And there saw “The Tempest;” but it is but ill done by Gosnell, in lieu of Moll Davis.

1669-01-21 14:05   In my own coach home, where I find Madam Turner, Dyke, and The.; and had a good dinner for them, and merry; and so carried them to the Duke of York’s house, all but Dyke, who went away on other business.

1669-01-21 12:05 r This I was glad of, finding reason to doubt that I might in this fear to offend either the Duke of York by denying it, or else offend my Lord Sandwich by accepting it, or denying it in a manner that might not forward his desire for Sir Charles Harbord.

1669-01-21 12:02   To White Hall to a Committee of Tangier, and by and by and till twelve at noon upon business, among others mine, where my desire about being eased of appointing and standing accountable for a Treasurer there was well accepted, and they will think of some other way.

1669-01-20 22:03 r We home, my wife letting fall some words of her observing my eyes to be mightily employed in the playhouse, meaning upon women, which did vex me; but, however, when we come home, we were good friends; and so to read, and to supper, and so to bed.

1669-01-20 17:17   With my wife and W. Hewer to the Duke of York’s house, and saw “Twelfth Night,” as it is now revived; but, I think, one of the weakest plays that ever I saw on the stage.

1669-01-20 13:28   I called with my wife at Dancre’s, the great landscape-painter; and have bespoke him to come to take measure of my dining-room panelsm, and there I met with the pretty daughter of the coalseller’s, that lived in Cheapside, who hath her picture drawn here, but very poorly.

1669-01-20 10:34 r Which these Merchants oppose, and demanding leave to try the justice of the City’s demand by a Quo Warranto, which the City opposed, the Merchants did quite lay the City on their backs with great triumph, the City’s cause being apparently too weak.

1669-01-20 10:32   I heard at the Council-board the City, by their single counsel Symson, and the company of Strangers Merchants, a debate the business of water-baylage; a tax demanded upon all goods, by the City, imported and exported.

1669-01-19 17:15   To the King’s house, to see “Horace;” the third day of its acting — a silly tragedy; but Lacy hath made a farce of several dances. But his words are but silly, and invention not extraordinary, as to the dances; only some Dutchmen come out of the mouth and tail of a Hamburgh sow.

1669-01-18 18:52   To the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there saw “The Witts,” a medley of things, but some similes mighty good, though ill mixed; and thence with my wife to the Exchange and bought some things, and so home.

1669-01-18 12:02   I went with my young gentlemen (thereby to get a little time while W. Hewer went home to bid them get a dinner ready) to the Pope’s Head tavern, to see the painted room which Rogerson told me of, of his doing; but I do not like it at all though it be good for such a public room.

1669-01-18 10:05 r I was glad to see this competition come about, that my Lord Sandwich is apparently jealous of my thinking that the Duke of York do mean me more kindness than him.

1669-01-18 10:03 r That when he come the other day to move this to the Board of Tangier, the Duke of York, it seems, did readily reply, that it was fit to have Mr. Pepys satisfied therein first, and that it was not good to make places for persons.

1669-01-18 10:01   My Lord Sandwich tell me he did propose to the Duke of York alone that a pay-master should be at Tangier; and that being desirous to do a courtesy to Sir Charles Harbord, and to prevent the Duke of York’s looking out for any body else, he did name him to the Duke of York.

1669-01-18 09:10   To Sir William Coventry’s, and there discoursed the business of my Treasurer’s place, at Tangier, wherein he consents to my desire, and concurs therein, which I am glad of, that I may not be accountable for a man so far off.

1669-01-17 17:05 r Here all the discourse is that now the King is of opinion to have the Parliament called, notwithstanding his late resolutions for proroguing them; so unstable are his councils, and those about him.

1669-01-17 15:53 r I met Hugh May, and he brings me to the knowledge of Sir Henry Capell, who hath a great value, for me; and they appoint a day to come and dine with me, and see my books, and papers of the Office, which I shall be glad to show them, and have opportunity to satisfy them therein.

1669-01-17 15:10   I into the Court, and there up and down and spoke with my Lords Bellassis and Peterborough about the business now in dispute, about my deputing a Treasurer to pay the garrison at Tangier, which I would avoid, and not be accountable, and they will serve me therein.

1669-01-17 13:32 r We were civilly merry, and Mrs. Batelier a discreet woman, but mighty fond in the stories she tells of her son Will. After dinner, Mr. Spong and I to my closet, there to try my instrument Parallelogram, which do well, to my full content; but only a little stiff, as being new.

1669-01-17 12:03   To church myself after seeing every thing fitted for dinner, and so, after church, home, and thither comes Mrs. Batelier and her two daughters to dinner to us; and W. Hewer and his mother, and Mr. Spong.

1669-01-16 16:17 r And so we are in the old mad condition, or rather worse than any; no man knowing what the French intend to do the next summer.

1669-01-16 16:12 r He says that the Duchess of York and the Duke of York are mighty great with her, which is a great interest to my Lord Chancellor’s family; and that they do agree to hinder all they can the proceedings of the Duke of Buckingham and Arlington.

1669-01-16 16:07 r Povy tells me that Sir W. Coventry was with the King alone, an hour this day; and that my Lady Castlemayne is now in a higher command over the King than ever — not as a mistress, for she scorns him, but as a tyrant, to command him.

1669-01-16 15:52   Povy talking of public things, told me, as Mr. Wren also did, that the Parliament is likely to meet again, the King being frighted with what the Speaker hath put him in mind of — his promise not to prorogue, but only to adjourne them.

1669-01-15 15:20   I to White Hall, to the Lords of the Treasury, about Tangier business; and there was by at much merry discourse between them and my Lord Anglesey, who made sport of our new Treasurers, and called them his deputys, and much of that kind.

1669-01-15 12:02 r Down with Lord Brouncker to Sir R. Murray, into the King’s little elaboratory, under his closet, a pretty place; and there saw a great many chymical glasses and things, but understood none of them.

1669-01-15 11:20 r And the Duke of York answered me just thus: that he ought to have a care of him that do the King’s business in the manner that I do, and words of more force than that.

1669-01-15 11:15 r I did give the Duke of York thanks for his favour to me at the Committee of Tangier in my absence, of the discourse of doing something as to putting the payment of the garrison into some undertaker’s hand which the Duke would not suffer to go on without my presence at the debate.

1669-01-15 10:12 r Thence Sir W. Coventry and I out of doors, but he to Sir J. Duncomb, and I to White Hall through the Park, where I met the King and the Duke of York, and so walked with them, and so to White Hall.

1669-01-15 08:50 r When my Lady Castlemayne made the King to release her and to order her to act it again, worse than ever, where the King himself was: and since it was acted again, and my Lady Harvy provided people to hiss her and fling oranges at her. Ii seems the heat is come to a great height.

1669-01-15 08:45 r It is about my Lady Harvy’s being offended at Doll Common’s acting of Sempronia, to imitate her; for which she got my Lord Chamberlain, her kinsman, to imprison Doll.

1669-01-15 08:40   To Sir W. Coventry, where with him a good while in his chamber, talking of one thing or another; among others, he told me of the great factions at Court at this day, even to the sober engaging of great persons, and differences, and making the King cheap and ridiculous.

1669-01-14 22:04   Up and to the office, where all the morning busy, and so home to dinner, where Goodgroome with us, and after dinner a song, and then to the office, where busy till night, and then home to work there with W. Hewer to get ready some Tangier papers, and so to supper and to bed.

1669-01-13 20:12   This day come home the instrument I have so long longed for, the Parallelogram.

1669-01-13 17:10   I and my wife and Talbot towards the Temple, and there to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Maiden Queene.”

1669-01-13 14:03   Home, after visiting my Lady Peterborough, and there by invitation find Mr. Povy, and there was also Talbot Pepys, newly come from Impington, and dined with me; and after dinner a little talk with Povy about public matters.

1669-01-13 08:30 r Lay well all night, and long in bed talking together, with much pleasure, it being, I know, nothing but her doubt of my going out yesterday, without telling her of my going, which did vex her, poor wretch!

1669-01-13 01:57 r She did by little and little, very sillily, let all the discourse fall; and about two, but with much seeming difficulty, come to bed.

1669-01-13 01:04 r She come to my side of the bed, and drew my curtaine open, and with the tongs red hot at the ends, made as if she did design to pinch me with them, at which, in dismay, I rose up, and with a few words she laid them down.

1669-01-13 00:30 r She invented, I believe, a business that I was seen in a hackney coach with the glasses up with Deb., but could not tell the time, nor was sure I was he. I did, as I might truly, deny it, and was mightily troubled, but all would not serve.

1669-01-13 00:04 r At this being troubled, I after a while prayed her to come to bed, all my people being gone to bed; so, after an hour or two, she silent, and I now and then praying her to come to bed, she fell out into a fury, that I was a rogue, and false to her.

1669-01-12 22:45 r But waking by and by out of a slumber, which I usually fall into presently after my coming into the bed, I found she did not prepare to come to bed, but got fresh candles, and more wood for her fire, it being mighty cold, too.

1669-01-12 22:15 r I observed my wife mighty dull, and I myself was not mighty fond, because of some hard words she did give me at noon, out of a jealousy at my being abroad this morning, which, God knows, it was upon the business of the Office unexpectedly, but I to bed.

1669-01-12 12:04   Home, to dinner, where I discern my wife to have been in pain about where I have been, but said nothing to me, but I believe did send W. Hewer to seek me, but I take no notice of it, but am vexed.

1669-01-12 10:55 r Mr. Pierce, I asking him whither he was going, told me as a great secret that he was going to his master’s mistress, Mrs. Churchill, with some physic; meaning for the pox I suppose, or else that she is got with child.

1669-01-12 10:45   Meeting Mr. Pierce at White Hall, he tells me that his boy hath a great mind to see me, and is going to school again; and Dr. Clerke, being by, do tell me that he is a fine boy; but I durst not answer anything, because I durst not invite him to my house, for fear of my wife.

1669-01-12 09:55 r And there did dispute the business, it being about the matter of paying a little money to Chatham Yard, wherein I find the Treasurers mighty supple, and I believe we shall bring them to reason, though they begun mighty upon us.

1669-01-12 09:02   Up, and to the Office, where, by occasion of a message from the Treasurers that their Board found fault with Commissioner Middleton, I went up from our Board to the Lords of the Treasury to meet our Treasurers, and did.

1669-01-11 21:04   At home all the evening; and made Tom to prick down some little conceits and notions of mine, in musique, which do mightily encourage me to spend some more thoughts about it; for I fancy, that I am in the right way of unfolding the mystery of this matter, better than ever yet.

1669-01-11 18:52 r Here Mrs. Smith tells us of the great murder thereabouts, on Saturday last, of one Captain Bumbridge, by one Symons, both of her acquaintance; the former is killed, and is kinsman to my Lord of Ormond.

1669-01-11 18:40 r Thence to the New Exchange, to buy some things; and, among others, my wife did give me my pair of gloves, which, by contract, she is to give me in her 30l. a-year.

1669-01-11 17:20   Abroad with my wife to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Joviall Crew,” but ill acted to what it was heretofore, in Clun’s time, and when Lacy could dance.

1669-01-10 21:00   So about noon, past 12, we rose, and to dinner, and then to read and talk, my wife and I alone, for Balty was gone, who come to dine with us, and then in the evening comes Pelling to sit and talk with us, and so to supper and pretty merry discourse.

1669-01-10 10:11   Accidentally talking of our maids, I said a little word that did give occasion to my wife to fall out; and she did most vexatiously, but ended most perfect good friends; but the thoughts of the unquiet which her ripping up of old faults will give me did make me melancholy.

1669-01-09 22:30 r I to the Office and did a good deal of business, and so home to supper and to bed with my mind mightily pleased with this day’s management, as one of the days of my life of fullest content.

1669-01-09 14:50 r And here I had a neat dinner, and all in so good manner and fashion, and with so good company, and everything to my mind, as I never had more in my life — the company being to my heart’s content, and they all well pleased.

1669-01-09 13:40   My Lord Brouncker, Mr. Wren, Joseph Williamson, and Captain Cocke, dined with me; and, being newly sat down, comes in, by invitation of Williamson’s, the Lieutenant of the Tower, and he brings in with him young Mr. Whore, whose father, of the Tower, I know.

1669-01-08 22:22   And so to the office to do a little business, and then home to my wife’s chamber, my people having laid the cloth, and got the rooms all clean above-stairs tonight for our dinner tomorrow, and therefore I to bed.

1669-01-08 14:55   My wife and I and Mr. Hater to White Hall, where she set us down, while we at the Treasury-Chamber, where I alone did manage the business of “The Leopard” against the whole Committee of the East India Company; and to the silencing of them all, to my no great content.

1669-01-08 10:10   The Duke was mighty plain with the Treasurers, according to the advice my Lord Brouncker and I did give him the other night, and he did it fully; and so as, I believe, will make the Treasurers carefull of themselves, unless they do resolve upon defying the Duke of York.

1669-01-07 17:22 r We sat in an upper box, and the jade Nell come and sat in the next box; a bold merry slut, who lay laughing there upon people; and with a comrade of hers of the Duke’s house, that come in to see the play.

1669-01-07 17:10   My wife and I to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Island Princesse,” the first time I ever saw it; and it is a pretty good play, many good things being in it, and a good scene of a town on fire.

1669-01-06 22:20 r Being moonshine and fine frost, they went home, I lending some of them my coach to help to carry them, and so my wife and I spent the rest of the evening in talk and reading, and so with great pleasure to bed.

1669-01-06 19:40 r After a new fashion, to prevent spoiling the cake, did put so many titles into a hat, and so drew cuts; and I was the Queene; and The. Turner, King — Creed, Sir Martin Marr-all; and Betty, Mrs. Millicent: and so we were mighty merry.

1669-01-06 19:02 r Very merry we were at dinner, and so all the afternoon, talking, and looking up and down my house; and in the evening I did bring out my cake — a noble cake, and there cut it into pieces, with wine and good drink.

1669-01-06 12:22   At noon comes Mrs. Turner and Dyke, and Mrs. Dickenson, and then comes The. and Betty Turner, the latter of which is a very pretty girl; and then Creed and his wife, whom I sent for by my coach. These were my guests, and Mrs. Turner’s friend whom I saw the other day, Mr. Wicken.

1669-01-06 01:10   I to the Office again, and there late, and then home to supper to my wife, who is not very well of those, and so sat talking till past one in the morning, and then to bed.

1669-01-05 19:34   Comes Creed to me, and tells me his wife is at my house. So I in, and spent an hour with them, the first time she hath been here, or I have seen her, since she was married. She is not overhandsome, though a good lady, and one I love.

1669-01-04 21:10   I took up my wife at Unthank’s, and so home, and there with pleasure to read and talk, and so to supper, and put into writing, in merry terms, our agreement between my wife and me, about 30l. a-year. This was done under both our hands merrily, and put into W. Hewer’s to keep.

1669-01-04 16:12   Up and down the house, and to the Duke of York’s side, and there in the Duchess’s presence; and was mightily complimented by my Lady Peterborough, in my Lord Sandwich’s presence, whom she engaged to thank me for my kindness to her and her Lord.

1669-01-04 15:00   To White Hall, where a Committee of Tangier met but little to do there, but I did receive an instance of the Duke of York’s kindness to me, and the whole Committee, that they would not order any thing about the Treasurer for the Corporation now in establishing without my assent.

1669-01-04 13:55 r Mrs. Turner, the mother, and Mrs. Dyke, and The., and Betty was the company, and a gentleman of their acquaintance. Betty I did long to see, and she is indifferent pretty, but not what the world did speak of her; but I am mighty glad to have one so pretty of our kindred.

1669-01-04 13:49 r So, I went to them afterwards, and dined with them, and mighty handsomely treated, and she a wonderful merry, good-humoured, fat, but plain woman, but I believe a very good woman, and mighty civil to me.

1669-01-04 11:10   The. Turner called me, out of her coach where her mother, &c., was, and invited me by all means to dine with them, at my cozen Roger’s mistress’s, the widow Dickenson.

1669-01-04 10:40   W. Hewer and I went in and saw the great tall woman that is to be seen, who is but twenty-one years old, and I do easily stand under her arms.

1669-01-04 08:30   Lay long, talking with my wife, and did of my own accord come to an allowance of her of 30l. a-year for all expences, clothes and everything, which she was mightily pleased with, it being more than ever she asked or expected, and so rose, with much content.

1669-01-03 22:15   My wife and I treating about coming to an allowance to my wife for clothes; and there I, out of my natural backwardness, did hang off, which vexed her, and did occasion some discontented talk in bed, when we went to bed.

1669-01-03 18:30   To White Hall by coach, and I with my Lord Brouncker to attend the Duke of York, and then up and down the House till the evening, hearing how the King do intend this frosty weather, it being this day the first, and very hard frost, that hath come this year, and very cold it is.

1669-01-03 14:45 r Dinner done, I out with W. Hewer and Mr. Spong, who by accident come to dine with me, and good talk with him.

1669-01-03 14:03 r A good dinner, and all our plate out, and mighty fine and merry, only I a little vexed at burning a new table-cloth myself, with one of my trencher-salts.

1669-01-03 12:15   Up, and busy all the morning, getting rooms and dinner ready for my guests, which were my uncle and aunt Wight, and two of their cousins, and an old woman, and Mr. Mills and his wife.

1669-01-02 12:03   Up, at the office all the morning, and at noon home to dinner, where I find my cabinet come home, and paid for it, and it pleases me and my wife well.

1669-01-01 22:30 r So back to my aunt’s, and there supped and talked, and staid pretty late, it being dry and moonshine, and so walked home, and to bed in very good humour.

1669-01-01 17:20   My wife and I to the King’s playhouse, and there in a box saw “The Mayden Queene.” Knepp looked upon us, but I durst not show her any countenance; and, as well as I could carry myself, I found my wife uneasy there, poor wretch! therefore I shall avoid that house as much as I can.

1669-01-01 13:28   And so to my uncle’s, and met my wife; and there, with W. Hewer, we dined with our family, and had a very good dinner, and pretty merry.

1669-01-01 11:15   So back to the old Exchange, and there met my uncle Wight; and there walked, and met with the Houblons, and talked with them — gentlemen whom I honour mightily.

1669-01-01 09:58   With W. Hewer to the New Exchange, and then he and I to the cabinet-shops, to look out, and did agree, for a cabinet to give my wife for a New-year’s gift; and I did buy one cost me 11l., which is very pretty, of walnutt-tree, and will come home tomorrow.

1669-01-01 07:45   Up, and presented from Captain Beckford with a noble silver warming-pan, which I am doubtful whether to take or no.
