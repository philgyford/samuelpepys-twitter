1669-01-16 16:17 r And so we are in the old mad condition, or rather worse than any; no man knowing what the French intend to do the next summer.

1669-01-16 16:12 r He says that the Duchess of York and the Duke of York are mighty great with her, which is a great interest to my Lord Chancellor’s family; and that they do agree to hinder all they can the proceedings of the Duke of Buckingham and Arlington.

1669-01-16 16:07 r Povy tells me that Sir W. Coventry was with the King alone, an hour this day; and that my Lady Castlemayne is now in a higher command over the King than ever — not as a mistress, for she scorns him, but as a tyrant, to command him.

1669-01-16 15:52   Povy talking of public things, told me, as Mr. Wren also did, that the Parliament is likely to meet again, the King being frighted with what the Speaker hath put him in mind of — his promise not to prorogue, but only to adjourne them.

1669-01-15 15:20   I to White Hall, to the Lords of the Treasury, about Tangier business; and there was by at much merry discourse between them and my Lord Anglesey, who made sport of our new Treasurers, and called them his deputys, and much of that kind.

1669-01-15 12:02 r Down with Lord Brouncker to Sir R. Murray, into the King’s little elaboratory, under his closet, a pretty place; and there saw a great many chymical glasses and things, but understood none of them.

1669-01-15 11:20 r And the Duke of York answered me just thus: that he ought to have a care of him that do the King’s business in the manner that I do, and words of more force than that.

1669-01-15 11:15 r I did give the Duke of York thanks for his favour to me at the Committee of Tangier in my absence, of the discourse of doing something as to putting the payment of the garrison into some undertaker’s hand which the Duke would not suffer to go on without my presence at the debate.

1669-01-15 10:12 r Thence Sir W. Coventry and I out of doors, but he to Sir J. Duncomb, and I to White Hall through the Park, where I met the King and the Duke of York, and so walked with them, and so to White Hall.

1669-01-15 08:50 r When my Lady Castlemayne made the King to release her and to order her to act it again, worse than ever, where the King himself was: and since it was acted again, and my Lady Harvy provided people to hiss her and fling oranges at her. Ii seems the heat is come to a great height.

1669-01-15 08:45 r It is about my Lady Harvy’s being offended at Doll Common’s acting of Sempronia, to imitate her; for which she got my Lord Chamberlain, her kinsman, to imprison Doll.

1669-01-15 08:40   To Sir W. Coventry, where with him a good while in his chamber, talking of one thing or another; among others, he told me of the great factions at Court at this day, even to the sober engaging of great persons, and differences, and making the King cheap and ridiculous.

1669-01-14 22:04   Up and to the office, where all the morning busy, and so home to dinner, where Goodgroome with us, and after dinner a song, and then to the office, where busy till night, and then home to work there with W. Hewer to get ready some Tangier papers, and so to supper and to bed.

1669-01-13 20:12   This day come home the instrument I have so long longed for, the Parallelogram.

1669-01-13 17:10   I and my wife and Talbot towards the Temple, and there to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Maiden Queene.”

1669-01-13 14:03   Home, after visiting my Lady Peterborough, and there by invitation find Mr. Povy, and there was also Talbot Pepys, newly come from Impington, and dined with me; and after dinner a little talk with Povy about public matters.

1669-01-13 08:30 r Lay well all night, and long in bed talking together, with much pleasure, it being, I know, nothing but her doubt of my going out yesterday, without telling her of my going, which did vex her, poor wretch!

1669-01-13 01:57 r She did by little and little, very sillily, let all the discourse fall; and about two, but with much seeming difficulty, come to bed.

1669-01-13 01:04 r She come to my side of the bed, and drew my curtaine open, and with the tongs red hot at the ends, made as if she did design to pinch me with them, at which, in dismay, I rose up, and with a few words she laid them down.

1669-01-13 00:30 r She invented, I believe, a business that I was seen in a hackney coach with the glasses up with Deb., but could not tell the time, nor was sure I was he. I did, as I might truly, deny it, and was mightily troubled, but all would not serve.

1669-01-13 00:04 r At this being troubled, I after a while prayed her to come to bed, all my people being gone to bed; so, after an hour or two, she silent, and I now and then praying her to come to bed, she fell out into a fury, that I was a rogue, and false to her.

1669-01-12 22:45 r But waking by and by out of a slumber, which I usually fall into presently after my coming into the bed, I found she did not prepare to come to bed, but got fresh candles, and more wood for her fire, it being mighty cold, too.

1669-01-12 22:15 r I observed my wife mighty dull, and I myself was not mighty fond, because of some hard words she did give me at noon, out of a jealousy at my being abroad this morning, which, God knows, it was upon the business of the Office unexpectedly, but I to bed.

1669-01-12 12:04   Home, to dinner, where I discern my wife to have been in pain about where I have been, but said nothing to me, but I believe did send W. Hewer to seek me, but I take no notice of it, but am vexed.

1669-01-12 10:55 r Mr. Pierce, I asking him whither he was going, told me as a great secret that he was going to his master’s mistress, Mrs. Churchill, with some physic; meaning for the pox I suppose, or else that she is got with child.

1669-01-12 10:45   Meeting Mr. Pierce at White Hall, he tells me that his boy hath a great mind to see me, and is going to school again; and Dr. Clerke, being by, do tell me that he is a fine boy; but I durst not answer anything, because I durst not invite him to my house, for fear of my wife.

1669-01-12 09:55 r And there did dispute the business, it being about the matter of paying a little money to Chatham Yard, wherein I find the Treasurers mighty supple, and I believe we shall bring them to reason, though they begun mighty upon us.

1669-01-12 09:02   Up, and to the Office, where, by occasion of a message from the Treasurers that their Board found fault with Commissioner Middleton, I went up from our Board to the Lords of the Treasury to meet our Treasurers, and did.

1669-01-11 21:04   At home all the evening; and made Tom to prick down some little conceits and notions of mine, in musique, which do mightily encourage me to spend some more thoughts about it; for I fancy, that I am in the right way of unfolding the mystery of this matter, better than ever yet.

1669-01-11 18:52 r Here Mrs. Smith tells us of the great murder thereabouts, on Saturday last, of one Captain Bumbridge, by one Symons, both of her acquaintance; the former is killed, and is kinsman to my Lord of Ormond.

1669-01-11 18:40 r Thence to the New Exchange, to buy some things; and, among others, my wife did give me my pair of gloves, which, by contract, she is to give me in her 30l. a-year.

1669-01-11 17:20   Abroad with my wife to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Joviall Crew,” but ill acted to what it was heretofore, in Clun’s time, and when Lacy could dance.

1669-01-10 21:00   So about noon, past 12, we rose, and to dinner, and then to read and talk, my wife and I alone, for Balty was gone, who come to dine with us, and then in the evening comes Pelling to sit and talk with us, and so to supper and pretty merry discourse.

1669-01-10 10:11   Accidentally talking of our maids, I said a little word that did give occasion to my wife to fall out; and she did most vexatiously, but ended most perfect good friends; but the thoughts of the unquiet which her ripping up of old faults will give me did make me melancholy.

1669-01-09 22:30 r I to the Office and did a good deal of business, and so home to supper and to bed with my mind mightily pleased with this day’s management, as one of the days of my life of fullest content.

1669-01-09 14:50 r And here I had a neat dinner, and all in so good manner and fashion, and with so good company, and everything to my mind, as I never had more in my life — the company being to my heart’s content, and they all well pleased.

1669-01-09 13:40   My Lord Brouncker, Mr. Wren, Joseph Williamson, and Captain Cocke, dined with me; and, being newly sat down, comes in, by invitation of Williamson’s, the Lieutenant of the Tower, and he brings in with him young Mr. Whore, whose father, of the Tower, I know.

1669-01-08 22:22   And so to the office to do a little business, and then home to my wife’s chamber, my people having laid the cloth, and got the rooms all clean above-stairs to-night for our dinner to-morrow, and therefore I to bed.

1669-01-08 14:55   My wife and I and Mr. Hater to White Hall, where she set us down, while we at the Treasury-Chamber, where I alone did manage the business of “The Leopard” against the whole Committee of the East India Company; and to the silencing of them all, to my no great content.

1669-01-08 10:10   The Duke was mighty plain with the Treasurers, according to the advice my Lord Brouncker and I did give him the other night, and he did it fully; and so as, I believe, will make the Treasurers carefull of themselves, unless they do resolve upon defying the Duke of York.

1669-01-07 17:22 r We sat in an upper box, and the jade Nell come and sat in the next box; a bold merry slut, who lay laughing there upon people; and with a comrade of hers of the Duke’s house, that come in to see the play.

1669-01-07 17:10   My wife and I to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Island Princesse,” the first time I ever saw it; and it is a pretty good play, many good things being in it, and a good scene of a town on fire.

1669-01-06 22:20 r Being moonshine and fine frost, they went home, I lending some of them my coach to help to carry them, and so my wife and I spent the rest of the evening in talk and reading, and so with great pleasure to bed.

1669-01-06 19:40 r After a new fashion, to prevent spoiling the cake, did put so many titles into a hat, and so drew cuts; and I was the Queene; and The. Turner, King — Creed, Sir Martin Marr-all; and Betty, Mrs. Millicent: and so we were mighty merry.

1669-01-06 19:02 r Very merry we were at dinner, and so all the afternoon, talking, and looking up and down my house; and in the evening I did bring out my cake — a noble cake, and there cut it into pieces, with wine and good drink.

1669-01-06 12:22   At noon comes Mrs. Turner and Dyke, and Mrs. Dickenson, and then comes The. and Betty Turner, the latter of which is a very pretty girl; and then Creed and his wife, whom I sent for by my coach. These were my guests, and Mrs. Turner’s friend whom I saw the other day, Mr. Wicken.

1669-01-06 01:10   I to the Office again, and there late, and then home to supper to my wife, who is not very well of those, and so sat talking till past one in the morning, and then to bed.

1669-01-05 19:34   Comes Creed to me, and tells me his wife is at my house. So I in, and spent an hour with them, the first time she hath been here, or I have seen her, since she was married. She is not overhandsome, though a good lady, and one I love.

1669-01-04 21:10   I took up my wife at Unthank’s, and so home, and there with pleasure to read and talk, and so to supper, and put into writing, in merry terms, our agreement between my wife and me, about 30l. a-year. This was done under both our hands merrily, and put into W. Hewer’s to keep.

1669-01-04 16:12   Up and down the house, and to the Duke of York’s side, and there in the Duchess’s presence; and was mightily complimented by my Lady Peterborough, in my Lord Sandwich’s presence, whom she engaged to thank me for my kindness to her and her Lord.

1669-01-04 15:00   To White Hall, where a Committee of Tangier met but little to do there, but I did receive an instance of the Duke of York’s kindness to me, and the whole Committee, that they would not order any thing about the Treasurer for the Corporation now in establishing without my assent.

1669-01-04 13:55 r Mrs. Turner, the mother, and Mrs. Dyke, and The., and Betty was the company, and a gentleman of their acquaintance. Betty I did long to see, and she is indifferent pretty, but not what the world did speak of her; but I am mighty glad to have one so pretty of our kindred.

1669-01-04 13:49 r So, I went to them afterwards, and dined with them, and mighty handsomely treated, and she a wonderful merry, good-humoured, fat, but plain woman, but I believe a very good woman, and mighty civil to me.

1669-01-04 11:10   The. Turner called me, out of her coach where her mother, &c., was, and invited me by all means to dine with them, at my cozen Roger’s mistress’s, the widow Dickenson.

1669-01-04 10:40   W. Hewer and I went in and saw the great tall woman that is to be seen, who is but twenty-one years old, and I do easily stand under her arms.

1669-01-04 08:30   Lay long, talking with my wife, and did of my own accord come to an allowance of her of 30l. a-year for all expences, clothes and everything, which she was mightily pleased with, it being more than ever she asked or expected, and so rose, with much content.

1669-01-03 22:15   My wife and I treating about coming to an allowance to my wife for clothes; and there I, out of my natural backwardness, did hang off, which vexed her, and did occasion some discontented talk in bed, when we went to bed.

1669-01-03 18:30   To White Hall by coach, and I with my Lord Brouncker to attend the Duke of York, and then up and down the House till the evening, hearing how the King do intend this frosty weather, it being this day the first, and very hard frost, that hath come this year, and very cold it is.

1669-01-03 14:45 r Dinner done, I out with W. Hewer and Mr. Spong, who by accident come to dine with me, and good talk with him.

1669-01-03 14:03 r A good dinner, and all our plate out, and mighty fine and merry, only I a little vexed at burning a new table-cloth myself, with one of my trencher-salts.

1669-01-03 12:15   Up, and busy all the morning, getting rooms and dinner ready for my guests, which were my uncle and aunt Wight, and two of their cousins, and an old woman, and Mr. Mills and his wife.

1669-01-02 12:03   Up, at the office all the morning, and at noon home to dinner, where I find my cabinet come home, and paid for it, and it pleases me and my wife well.

1669-01-01 22:30 r So back to my aunt’s, and there supped and talked, and staid pretty late, it being dry and moonshine, and so walked home, and to bed in very good humour.

1669-01-01 17:20   My wife and I to the King’s playhouse, and there in a box saw “The Mayden Queene.” Knepp looked upon us, but I durst not show her any countenance; and, as well as I could carry myself, I found my wife uneasy there, poor wretch! therefore I shall avoid that house as much as I can.

1669-01-01 13:28   And so to my uncle’s, and met my wife; and there, with W. Hewer, we dined with our family, and had a very good dinner, and pretty merry.

1669-01-01 11:15   So back to the old Exchange, and there met my uncle Wight; and there walked, and met with the Houblons, and talked with them — gentlemen whom I honour mightily.

1669-01-01 09:58   With W. Hewer to the New Exchange, and then he and I to the cabinet-shops, to look out, and did agree, for a cabinet to give my wife for a New-year’s gift; and I did buy one cost me 11l., which is very pretty, of walnutt-tree, and will come home tomorrow.

1669-01-01 07:45   Up, and presented from Captain Beckford with a noble silver warming-pan, which I am doubtful whether to take or no.
